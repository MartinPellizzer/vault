Forty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, cadmium only, cadmium and oxygen, cadmium and ozone, and ozone only. Cadmium concentration (ASA method) and NAG activity (by the Maruhn method) were determined in the supernatants of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The histopathological alterations were evaluated in tissue sections.The highest concentration of cadmium and NAG activity was observed in rats intoxicated with cadmium. Ozone therapy led to a decrease in cadmium accumulation in the kidneys and liver. An examination of renal, hepatic and pancreatic tissues revealed severe histopathological lesions in Cadmium group (Cd) treated animals. The histopathological changes in animals treated with ozone were similar, but with slightly decreased intensity. Positive correlations between histochemical lesions, NAG activity and cadmium concentration in the study groups were observed. It has been shown that chronic cadmium intoxication has cytotoxic activity in the kidneys, liver, and pancreas, causing an increase in NAG activity. Ozone therapy significantly reduces NAG activity and the severity of histopathological lesions in the kidneys and liver, confirming its beneficial effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Environmental Analysis, Wroc\u0142aw Medical University, Poland mariola.sliwinska-mosson@umed.wroc.pl."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u015aliwi\u0144ska-Mosso\u0144", "ForeName": "Mariola", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Physiotherapy, University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sobiech", "ForeName": "Krzysztof", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Physiology and Ecotoxicology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dolezych", "ForeName": "Bogdan", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinological Gynaecology Clinic, Silesian University School of Medicine, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madej", "ForeName": "Pawe\u0142", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Environmental Analysis, Wroc\u0142aw Medical University, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milnerowicz", "ForeName": "Halina", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Clin Lab Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0410247", "ISSNLinking": "0091-7370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.52", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylglucosaminidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylglucosaminidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31028064", "49/2/193"]}}]}
