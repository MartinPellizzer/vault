Receiver operating curves were constructed to obtain cutoff values of MAPSE at the lateral and septal (and average) annulus of the mitral valve to predict LV systolic dysfunction, which was defined by an ejection fraction <52% for men and <54% for women as measured using the biplane method of disks. These cutoff values then were validated in another 105 patients. LV systolic dysfunction was present in 43% patients. Youden's index values of 9mm for lateral MPASE (area under the receiver operating curve [AUC] 0.93 [confidence interval {CI} 0.87-0.97]; p < 0.0001); 7mm for septal MAPSE (AUC 0.87 [CI 0.79-0.92]; p < 0.0001); and 9mm for average MAPSE (AUC 0.92 [CI 0.86-0.96]; p < 0.0001) were obtained. These cutoffs were statistically significant in the validation cohort (p < 0.0001) with an AUC of 0.84 (CI 0.75-0.90), sensitivity of 86.2%, specificity of 80.8%, positive predictive value of 84.8%, and negative predictive value of 82.6%.", "MAPSE is a simple, rapid, and reliable method to detect LV dysfunction using TEE in patients undergoing OPCAB.
