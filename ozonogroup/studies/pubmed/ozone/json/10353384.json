An advantage of evaluating the frequency and spectra of ras mutations in chemically induced neoplasms is that the additional data at the molecular level indicate whether the carcinogenic effect is due to the chemical and is not a spontaneous event, as illustrated by the numerous examples in Appendices 1 and 2. In addition, data on the frequency and spectra of ras mutations in spontaneous and chemically induced neoplasms clearly expand the toxicological database by providing information helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. For example: (1) ozone-induced lung neoplasms had two unique mutations, one (codon 61 K-ras CTA mutation) consistent with a direct genotoxic event and a second (codon 12 K-ras G --> T transversion) consistent with an indirect genotoxic effect; (2) isoprene-induced Harderian gland neoplasms had a unique K-ras A --> T transversion at codon 61 which provided evidence that formation of an epoxide intermediate was involved; (3) 1,3-butadiene-induced neoplasms had a characteristic K-ras G --> C transversion mutation at codon 13 which was also consistent with a chemical-specific effect; (4) methylene chloride-induced liver neoplasms had an H-ras mutation profile at codon 61 similar to that of spontaneous tumours, suggesting that methylene chloride promotes cells with 'spontaneously initiated' ras mutations and (5) oxazepam-induced liver neoplasms had a low frequency of ras mutations, suggesting a nonmutagenic pathway of carcinogenesis. By extending the evaluation of rodent tumours to include molecular studies on ras mutation spectra and abnormalities in other cancer genes with human homologues, a number of hypotheses can be tested, allowing the most complete understanding of carcinogenesis in rodents and in potential extrapolation to the human risk situation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sills", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boorman", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neal", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "H L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devereux", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "IARC Sci Publ", "NlmUniqueID": "8009542", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5038"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, ras"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germ-Line Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rodentia"}], "NumberOfReferences": "159"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10353384"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
