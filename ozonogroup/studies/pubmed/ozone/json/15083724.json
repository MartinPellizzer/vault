Initially, sanitizer solutions were inoculated to contain approximately 10(6) CFU/ml of either pathogen, after which aliquots were removed at 15-s intervals over a period of 5 min and approximately plated to determine log reduction times. Produce was dip inoculated to contain approximately 10(6) E. coli O157:H7 or L. monocytogenes CFU/g, held overnight, submerged in each sanitizer solution for up to 5 min, and then examined for survivors. In the model system study, both pathogens decreased > 5 log following 2 to 5 min of exposure, with ozone being most effective (15 s), followed by chlorine dioxide (19 to 21 s), chlorinated trisodium phosphate (25 to 27 s), and peroxyacetic acid (70 to 75 s). On produce, ozone and chlorine dioxide (5 ppm) were most effective, reducing populations approximately 5.6 log, with chlorine dioxide (3 ppm) and chlorinated trisodium phosphate (200 ppm chlorine) resulting in maximum reductions of approximately 4.9 log. Peroxyacetic acid was the least effective sanitizer (approximately 4.4-log reductions). After treatment, produce samples were stored at 4 degrees C for 9 days and quantitatively examined for E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, mesophilic aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Populations of both pathogens remained relatively unchanged, whereas numbers of mesophilic bacteria increased 2 to 3 log during storage. Final mold and yeast populations were significantly higher than initial counts for chlorine dioxide- and ozone-treated produce. Using the nonextended triangle test, whole apples exposed to chlorinated trisodium phosphate (200 ppm chlorine) and shredded lettuce exposed to peroxyacetic acid were statistically different from the other treated samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, 2108 South Anthony Hall, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-1225, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodgers", "ForeName": "Stephanie L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cash", "ForeName": "Jerry N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siddiq", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryser", "ForeName": "Elliot T", "Initials": "ET"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis melo"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fragaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Malus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15083724", "10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.721", "S0362-028X(22)03480-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
