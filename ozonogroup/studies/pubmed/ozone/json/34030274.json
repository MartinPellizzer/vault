Also, the rising applications of nanotechnology are resulting in the release and contamination of aquatic ecosystems with engineered nanometals like titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO<sub>2</sub>). The rise in ultraviolet radiation interacts with nanometals, increasing their bioactivities to susceptible aquatic organisms such as algae and cyanobacteria. The effect of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) and nTiO<sub>2</sub> on Microcystis flos-aquae and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata during inter-specific interaction was investigated. The specific growth rate (d<sup>-1</sup>) of M. flos-aquae exposed to nTiO<sub>2</sub> increased significantly under monoculture conditions but was suppressed during co-culture with P. subcapitata. Contrarily, UVB stimulated the growth of the cyanobacterium regardless of the presence or absence of the green microalgae. However, there was a general decline in the growth of P. subcapitata following cultivation with M. flos-aquae and exposure to UVB and nTiO<sub>2</sub>. The chlorophyll-a and total chlorophyll content of the monocultures of M. flos-aquae exposed to nTiO<sub>2</sub> increased while other co-culture treatments significantly decreased these parameters. The experimental treatments, UVB, nTiO<sub>2</sub>, and UVB\u00a0+\u00a0nTiO<sub>2</sub> had differential effects on the pigment content of P. subcapitata. The total protein content, intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, peroxidase (POD), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity of both M. flos-aquae and P. subcapitata increased at varying degrees as a function of the treatment condition. Microcystin content was highest in co-cultures exposed to UVB. The results of this study suggest that increasing levels of nTiO<sub>2</sub> and UVB significantly alter the growth and cellular metabolic activity of M. flos-aquae and P. subcapitata, but the cyanobacterium will probably be favored by increasing UVB levels and its interaction with nanometals like nTiO<sub>2</sub> in aquatic ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
