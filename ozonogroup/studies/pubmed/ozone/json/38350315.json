While evaporative and tailpipe emission of VOCs from the passenger vehicles can be eliminated largely, or even completely, by electrification, VOCs emission from the use of coatings in auto-repair is unavoidable and has long been ignored. Here, we present for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive investigation on the emission factors and process-specified characteristics of VOCs from auto-repair painting, based on field measurements over 15 representative auto-repair workshops in the Pearl-River-Delta area, China. Replacement of solvent-borne coatings with water-borne counterparts, which was only achieved partially in the Basecoat step but not in the Putty, Primer and Clearcoat steps, could reduce the per automobile VOCs emission from 756.5 to 489.6\u00a0g and the per automobile ozone formation potential (OFP) from 2776.5 to 1666.4\u00a0g. Implementation of exhaust after-treatment led to a further reduction of the per automobile VOCs emission to 340.9\u00a0g, which is still ca. 42% higher than that from the state-of-art painting processes for the manufacture of passenger vehicles. According to the analysis of VOCs compositions, the Putty process was dominated by the emission of styrene, while Primer, Basecoat (solvent-borne) and Clearcoat steps were all characterized by the emission of n-butyl acetate and xylenes. By contrast, water-borne Basecoat step showed a prominent emission of n-amyl alcohol. Notably, for the full painting process to repair an automobile, n-butyl acetate emerged as the most abundant species in the VOCs emission, whereas xylenes contributed most significantly to the OFP. Scenario analysis suggested that reducing VOCs contents in the coatings, as well as improving the after-treatment efficiency, were highly potential solutions for effective reduction of VOCs emission from auto-repair. Our study contributes to an update of industrial inventories of VOCs emission, and may provide valuable insights for reducing VOCs emission and OFPs from the auto-repair industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
