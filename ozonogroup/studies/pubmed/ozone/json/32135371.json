Herein, to enhance the mass transfer efficiency of reactants toward hydrophilic Fe-MCM-41 as well as enhance the interfacial reaction, the fluoride planting Fe-MCM-41 (F-Fe-MCM-41) was synthesized and employed as catalyst in catalytic ozonation for nitrobenzene (NB). Both NB and TOC removal were promoted in F-Fe-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub> with 99.0 % NB removal in 60\u202fmin and 88.6 % TOC removal in 120\u202fmin, which were superior to the degradation efficiency by O<sub>3</sub> and Fe-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub>. FTIR, EPR, M\u00f6ssbauer spectra, <sup>29</sup>Si NMR, <sup>19</sup>F NMR et al verified that the replacement of non-reactive silanols (-Si-OH) of Fe-MCM-41 with SiF groups could enhance its hydrophobicity, Lewis acidity and mass transfer effect. Comparative characterizations, experiments and theoretical calculations verified that interfacial reaction played the major role over liquid phase reaction for NB degradation in F-Fe-MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, the strengthened interfacial reaction also reduced the OH scavenging effect of water matrix, such as humic acid and carbonate. The interfacial adjustment method proposed in this study provided a novel insight into catalyst design and water treatment process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
