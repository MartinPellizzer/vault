Thus, it is extremely important to find ways to remove these pollutants without compromising the quality of reclaimed water. Ozonation has been successfully explored for this purpose, but it still presents limitations towards some oxidant-resistant pollutants. To surpass this, the conversion of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) into more reactive species is required, which can be accomplished by using catalysts. Carbon catalysts, such as activated carbons (ACs), represent a more environmentally attractive option than traditional metal-based catalysts, with the advantage of being easily modified to tune their textural and surface properties to the reaction chemistry. In this study, two different sources of ACs were tested in the catalytic ozonation of a frequently detected emerging pollutant: salicylic acid (SalAc). These ACs were submitted to thermal treatment under H<sub>2</sub> and functionalization with N precursors, such as melamine and poly(ethyleneimine), to induce changes in the surface properties, especially in the nitrogen content. Although no correlation was found between the N-content and catalytic activity, the thermal treatment under H<sub>2</sub> increased the mesopores surface area (S<sub>meso</sub>), which reflected in greater catalytic activity. As that, the best-performing AC was the one with the highest S<sub>meso</sub>, which revealed also to be resistant to O<sub>3</sub> and able to convert O<sub>3</sub> into more reactive species, evidenced by the capacity of oxalic acid, a well-known ozone-resistant by-product. The same AC was then submitted to three consecutive reutilization cycles and a more significant activity loss was observed in terms of SalAc degradation rate (\u2053 40%) then total organic carbon removal (\u2053 25%), from the first to the third cycle. This decline in efficiency was ascribed to the presence of by-products adhered to the catalyst surface, which impede its ability to react effectively with O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
