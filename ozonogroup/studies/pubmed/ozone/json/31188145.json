The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a single injection of ozone with that of a corticosteroid in the treatment of shoulder impingement.", "Thirty patients with shoulder pain and clinical signs and symptoms of impingement were randomly assigned into two groups: ultrasound-guided injection with ozone or corticosteroid. Patients' symptoms were evaluated by visual analog scale, constant score, shoulder pain and disability scale, shoulder range of motion, and ultrasonographic measures before treatment, 2 wks, and 2 mos after injections.", "Patients' visual analog scale, shoulder pain and disability scale and constant score improved significantly in both groups (P < 0.001), but the benefits were in favor of corticosteroid group (P < 0.001). At intervals between the two follow-ups, an improvement was observed in the visual analog scale score among patients receiving ozone, whereas during the same interval, patients' pain slightly worsened in the corticosteroid group. The range of motion and ultrasonographic measures did not show statistical differences between the two groups.", "Corticosteroid injection improves the pain and disability scores more significantly than a one-time ozone injection. Ozone may serve as an alternative modality in treating shoulder impingement when the use of steroids is contraindicated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Neuromusculoskeletal Research Center, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (AB-G, SE, TA, FG); Mission Pain and Spine, Mission Viejo, California (HRF); Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Research Center, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran (BE); and Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (MSK)."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babaei-Ghazani", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fadavi", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eftekharsadat", "ForeName": "Bina", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ebadi", "ForeName": "Safoora", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahadi", "ForeName": "Tannaz", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghazaei", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khabbaz", "ForeName": "Mohamad Sadegh", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Phys Med Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "8803677", "ISSNLinking": "0894-9115"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenal Cortex Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 2020 Jul;99(7):e89. doi: 10.1097/PHM.0000000000001303", "PMID": "31464748"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Cortex Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intra-Articular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Range of Motion, Articular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Shoulder Impingement Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Shoulder Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonography, Interventional"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31188145", "10.1097/PHM.0000000000001240"]}}]}
