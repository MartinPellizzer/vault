However, these herbicides have adverse biological effects that can damage the ecosystems and harm human health. As such, rapid and effective techniques that remove sulfonylurea residues from the environment are urgently required. Attempts have been made to remove sulfonylurea residues from environment using various techniques such as incineration, adsorption, photolysis, ozonation, and microbial degradation. Among them, biodegradation is regarded as a practical and environmentally responsible way to eliminate pesticide residues. Microbial strains such as Talaromyces flavus LZM1, Methylopila sp. SD-1, Ochrobactrum sp. ZWS16, Staphylococcus cohnii ZWS13, Enterobacter ludwigii sp. CE-1, Phlebia sp. 606, and Bacillus subtilis LXL-7 can almost completely degrade sulfonylureas. The degradation mechanism of the strains is such that sulfonylureas can be catalyzed by bridge hydrolysis to produce sulfonamides and heterocyclic compounds, which deactivate sulfonylureas. The molecular mechanisms associated with microbial degradation of sulfonylureas are relatively poorly studied, with hydrolase, oxidase, dehydrogenase and esterase currently known to play a pivotal role in the catabolic pathways of sulfonylureas. Till date, there are no reports specifically on the microbial degrading species and biochemical mechanisms of sulfonylureas. Hence, in this article, the degradation strains, metabolic pathways, and biochemical mechanisms of sulfonylurea biodegradation, along with its toxic effects on aquatic and terrestrial animals, are discussed in depth in order to provide new ideas for remediation of soil and sediments polluted by sulfonylurea herbicides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
