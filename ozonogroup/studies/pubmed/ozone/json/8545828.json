The metabolism of HCFC-123a was studied in microsomes of rats, mice, and humans as well as in rats and mice in vivo. Rat, mouse, and human liver microsomes metabolized HCFC-123a to inorganic fluoride and chlorodifluoroacetic acid. Fluoride formation was dependent on time and NADPH, HCFC-123a, and protein concentration. Microsomes from untreated rats oxidized HCFC-123a at low rates (0.49 nmol fluoride/20 min x mg protein). Pretreatment of rats with pyridine and ethanol, inducers of P450 2E1, increased the rates of fluoride release. In mouse liver microsomes, the rates of HCFC-123a oxidation to release fluoride were significantly higher (1.68 nmol fluoride/20 min x mg) than in rat liver microsomes. Incubation of HCFC-123a with microsomes and diethyldithiocarbamate (100 microM), an inhibitor of P450 2E1, reduced fluoride formation by more than 60%. In different samples of human liver microsomes, rates of fluoride formation were between two- and fourfold higher than those observed in liver microsomes from untreated rats. In rats and mice exposed to concentrations of HCFC-123a up to 5000 ppm in a closed recirculating exposure system, chlorodifluoroacetic acid, and inorganic fluoride were identified as urinary metabolites. The biotransformation of HCFC-123a in rats was saturated after exposure to more than 2000 ppm HCFC-123a for 6 hr, whereas no saturation was evident in mice exposed to concentrations of up to 5000 ppm. The obtained results suggest a major role of P450 2E1 in the oxidation of HCFC-123a and in the different capacities for oxidative biotransformation of HCFC-123a in rodents. Mice may thus be more sensitive to toxic effects of HCFC-123a depending on biotransformation after administration of high doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Toxikologie, Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dekant", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Assmann", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urban", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "354-23-4", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "99Z2744345", "NameOfSubstance": "Ditiocarb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NH9L3PP67S", "NameOfSubstance": "pyridine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q80VPU408O", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ditiocarb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8545828", "10.1006/taap.1995.1224", "S0041-008X(85)71224-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
