The synergistic ozonation process (O<sub>3</sub>/PMS) increased the efficiency of methyl-isothiazolinone (MIT) and chloro-methyl-isothiazolinone (CMIT) degradation to 91.0% and 81.8%, respectively, within 90\u00a0s at pH 7.0. This is 30.6% and 62.5% higher than the corresponding ozonation efficiency, respectively. Total radical formation value (R<sub>ct,</sub><sub>R</sub>) for the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process was 24.6 times that of ozonation alone. Calculated second-order rate constants for the reactions between isothiazolinone biocides and (k<sub>SO4</sub><sub>-,MIT</sub> and k<sub>SO4</sub><sub>-,CMIT</sub>) were 8.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup> and 4.49\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Relative contributions of O<sub>3</sub>, hydroxyl radical (OH) and oxidation to MIT and CMIT removal were estimated, which were 15%, 45%, and 40% for O<sub>3</sub>, OH and oxidation to MIT, and 1%, 67%, and 32% for O<sub>3</sub>, OH and oxidation to CMIT at pH 7.0, respectively. Factors influencing the O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process, namely the solution pH, chloride ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>), and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), were evaluated. Increasing the solution pH markedly accelerated O<sub>3</sub> decay and OH and formation, thus weakening the relative contribution of O<sub>3</sub> oxidation while enhancing that of OH and . Cl<sup>-</sup> had a negligible effect on MIT and CMIT degradation. Under the dual effect of bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) as inhibitor and promoter, low concentrations (1-2\u00a0mM) of bicarbonate weakly promoted MIT and CMIT degradation, while high concentrations (10-20\u00a0mM) induced strong inhibition. Lastly, oxidation performance of O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/PMS processes for MIT and CMIT degradation in different water matrices was compared."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
