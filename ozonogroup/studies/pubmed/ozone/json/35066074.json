However, this judgement is made without clear understandings on the removal behaviors of individual fDOM fractions. Therefore, the removals of high, medium and low molecular weight (MW), as well as hydrophobic fDOM fractions in a natural surface water were determined in this study for selected bench- and full-scale water treatment processes. The results showed that low MW (<1000\u00a0Da) and hydrophobic fractions of protein-like fDOM were more refractory than other fractions and even released during coagulation and ozonation processes. The corresponding removal efficiencies ranged -25.7%-68.6%. Besides, similar-sized, tyrosine- and tryptophan-like fDOM (F-Tyr and F-Trp) fractions exhibited distinct removal behaviors. Coagulation and powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption were ineffective in removing both types of fractions. Ozonation and ion exchange (IX) more effectively removed F-Trp, while F-Tyr fractions were more prone to nanofiltration (NF). Moreover, the integration of coagulation and IX pretreatment moderately enhanced F-Trp removal, but not F-Tyr removal by NF. However, the release of protein-like substances during ozonation, coagulation, and activated carbon-sand filtration adversely affected fDOM removal in a full-scale treatment plant. These findings highlighted the persistency of protein-like fDOM fractions in drinking water treatment processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
