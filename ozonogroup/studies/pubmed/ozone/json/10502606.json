This paper reports the adsorption equilibrium of 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) vapor in air streams on the commercial activated carbons PCB and BPL, which were made from coconut shell and bituminous coal, respectively, at 283, 293, 303, and 313 K. The experimental results show that within the experimental conditions, the adsorption capacities of the two adsorbents for HCFC-141b in dry air streams can be well-fitted by the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) adsorption equations. The physical properties of the adsorbents are consistent with the isotherm parameters obtained from the adsorption results. In addition, available experimental data of adsorption breakthrough at 283 K were used in conjunction with the Yoon and Nelson model to generate theoretical breakthrough curves based on the obtained values of parameters. In each case, calculated theoretical breakthrough curves are in agreement with corresponding experimental data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Health, Chia Nan College of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10502606", "10.1016/s0304-3894(99)00058-8", "S0304389499000588"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
