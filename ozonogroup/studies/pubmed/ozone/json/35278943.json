This imposes huge challenge to employ partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) process to treat THP-AD centrate. This study, for the first time, presented an effective strategy, ozone pretreatment, to alleviate such inhibitory effect. The activities of AOB and anammox bacteria increased with increasing ozone dosage, which were likely related to the transformation of organic compounds including humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances as well as high molecular weight (HMW) protein. Long-term operation of PN/A system further demonstrated the improved performance in term of nitrogen removal, organics degradation as well as sludge settleability and effluent solids. Nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 0.64 Kg N/m<sup>3</sup>/d was achieved (1.38\u00a0g\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>/ g COD), which was 42.2% higher compared to treating untreated THP-AD centrate. Effluent nitrate, the by-product of PN/A process, was reduced by 39.7% despite of its release in ozonation. This was due to the enhanced denitrification activity, humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances as well as HMW protein were significantly reduced. Overall, this study provides a promising method to improve PN/A performance and final effluent quality when treating organic-rich THP-AD centrate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
