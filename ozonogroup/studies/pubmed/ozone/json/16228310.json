All five tree species had been exposed to UV-B radiation for 5 years, in the field, at an enhancement level equivalent to an 18% ozone depletion. Measurements made during the fifth year of UV-B irradiation recorded reductions in light-saturated photosynthesis, transpiration and water use efficiencies. These changes were accompanied by marked reductions in individual leaf areas, stomatal density, stomatal conductance and carboxylation efficiency. There were no significant changes in the maximum variable fluorescence ratio, the quantum requirement of oxygen evolution, or light-saturated O(2) production. Analysis of the response of net carbon assimilation to changing intercellular CO(2) concentration (A/c(i) response) demonstrated no significant change in stomatal limitation. Reductions in photosynthesis were consistent with decreased carboxylation efficiency. Although all five tree species were similarly affected by UV-B radiation treatment, the magnitude of the responses was species-specific. These findings demonstrate the need for more long-term experimentation and also suggest that changes in water use efficiency may be a significant factor in plants' responses to UV-B radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences, School of Applied Sciences, Anglia Polytechnic University, East Road, Cambridge, CB1 1PT, UK, d.r.keiller@anglia.ac.uk."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keiller", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holmes", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Photosynth Res", "NlmUniqueID": "100954728", "ISSNLinking": "0166-8595"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Jun;99(2):473-81", "ArticleIdList": ["16668910"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1987 Apr;170(4):489-504", "ArticleIdList": ["24233012"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1986 Jan;10(1-2):51-62", "ArticleIdList": ["24435276"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1990 Apr 13;248(4952):206-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2326634"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1994 Mar;39(3):463-73", "ArticleIdList": ["24311137"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1981 Dec;153(4):376-87", "ArticleIdList": ["24276943"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1993 Nov;103(3):741-752", "ArticleIdList": ["12231976"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 1991 Aug 10;338(8763):393", "ArticleIdList": ["1677737"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1995 Feb;43(2):81-92", "ArticleIdList": ["24306741"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1993 Apr 23;260(5107):523-6", "ArticleIdList": ["17830433"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1992 Dec;92 (4):513-519", "ArticleIdList": ["28313222"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1985 Jul;164(4):557-64", "ArticleIdList": ["24248232"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Ecol Evol. 1997 Jan;12(1):22-8", "ArticleIdList": ["21237957"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1998 May;117(1):173-81", "ArticleIdList": ["9576786"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Jan;92(1):141-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16667236"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Ecol Evol. 1989 Dec;4(12):363-7", "ArticleIdList": ["21227379"]}, {"Citation": "Tree Physiol. 1993 Mar;12(2):151-62", "ArticleIdList": ["14969925"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1999 Dec;121(4):1349-58", "ArticleIdList": ["10594122"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16228310", "10.1023/A:1010620228989"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
