The reactions were monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode, ESI(-)-MS, and the intermediates and oxidation products characterized by ESI(-)-MS/MS. Both oxidative systems showed to be highly efficient in removing the color of the dye aqueous solutions. In the ESI(-)-MS of the indigo carmine solution treated with H(2)O(2) and H(2)O(2)/iodide, the presence of the ions of m/z 210 (indigo carmine in its anionic form, 1), 216, 226, 235, and 244 was noticeable. The anion of m/z 235 was proposed to be the unprecedented hydroperoxide intermediate 2 formed in solution via an electrophilic attack by hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals of the exocyclic C=C bond of 1. This intermediate was suggested to be rapidly converted into the anionic forms of 2,3-dioxo-1H-indole-5-sulfonic acid (3, m/z 226), 2-amino-alpha-oxo-5-sulfo-benzeneacetic acid (4, m/z 244), and 2-amino-5-sulfo-benzoic acid (5, m/z 216). In the ESI(-)-MS of the indigo carmine solution treated with O(3), two main anions were detected: m/z 216 (5) and 244 (4). Both products were proposed to be produced via an unstable ozonide intermediate. Other anions in this ESI(-) mass spectrum were attributed to be [4 - H + Na](-) of m/z 266, [4 - H](2-) of m/z 121.5, and [5 - H](2-) of m/z 107.5. ESI-MS/MS data were consistent with the proposed structures for the anionic products 2-5."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG 31270-901, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalm\u00e1zio", "ForeName": "Ilza", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Urzedo", "ForeName": "Ana P F M", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alves", "ForeName": "Tania M A", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Catharino", "ForeName": "Rodrigo R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eberlin", "ForeName": "Marcos N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nascentes", "ForeName": "Cl\u00e9sia C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Augusti", "ForeName": "Rodinei", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9504818", "ISSNLinking": "1076-5174"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D3741U8K7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Indigo Carmine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Indigo Carmine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17902099", "10.1002/jms.1159"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
