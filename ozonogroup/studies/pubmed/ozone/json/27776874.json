Pilot scale study showed that when the influent COD, TP and TSS were 73.0, 1.40 and 24.6mgL<sup>-1</sup>, the effluent COD, TP and TSS were 48.9, 0.32, 7.78mgL<sup>-1</sup> for System-A with the ozone and Fe<sup>2+</sup> dosage of 25mgL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.08mmolL<sup>-1</sup>, and 60.2, 1.16, 6.44mgL<sup>-1</sup> for System-B with the ozone dosage of 25mgL<sup>-1</sup>. The dosage of Fe<sup>2+</sup> into the BAF significantly enhanced the TP and OMPs removal ability. Exactly, the residual Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the BAF-A effluent stimulated the catalytic ozonation in the following ozone unit. Therefore, the OMPs removal in System-A was obviously better than that in System-B. The dosage of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from 0.02 to 0.10mmolL<sup>-1</sup> had slight adverse effect on the biofilm activity in BAF. Based on the TP and OMPs removal ability, the System-B is selected as a proposed process for the advanced treatment of petrochemical secondary effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016.
