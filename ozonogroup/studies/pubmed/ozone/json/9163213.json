Purulent maxillary sinusitis, which in 44% was combined with frontitis and in 56%--with fronto-ethmoiditis was diagnosed in all patients. Besides traditional therapy all patients were washed out daily inflamed sinuses with 0.9% solution of sodium chloride, saturated of ozone. After washing out the sinuses were aerated during 15-20 minutes through paracentesis needles and catheters with ozone-oxygen mixture, containing 6 mg/l of ozone. Speed of mixture flow--1 1/min. To the half of patient with phenomena of intoxication were introduced I/V 400 ml of physiologic salt solution (ozone concentration--0.8 mg/l). Treatment rate is 3-6 infusions. In patients pyorrhea and allocation of bacteria stopped 2-3 days earlier, than in control group, level of molecules of average weight was faster reduced to norm in the plasma of blood. Reduction of concentration of molecules of average weight corresponded to essential improvement of patient clinical condition (P < 0.01). Experience of ozone application testified about its high efficiency in paranasal sinusitis treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrov", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kudriavtsev", "ForeName": "B P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akulich", "ForeName": "I I", "Initials": "II"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Effektivnost' primeneniia preparatov ozona v kompleksnom lechenii paranazal'nykh sinusitov."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Voen Med Zh", "NlmUniqueID": "2984871R", "ISSNLinking": "0026-9050"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Military Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Remission Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Russia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sinusitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9163213"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
