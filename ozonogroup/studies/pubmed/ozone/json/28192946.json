Imaging the penetration and distribution of ozone at depth is beneficial for studying the influence of ozone on skin or eyes. Here, we introduced a facile method for three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the penetration of O<sub>3</sub> into the anterior chamber of an isolated crucian carp eye by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) combined with gold triangular nanoprisms (GTNPs) as the contrast agent and molecular probe. We illustrated the specific response of GTNPs to ozone and demonstrated that GTNPs can function as an efficient nanoprobe for sensing O<sub>3</sub>. The stabilities of GTNPs in different biologic solutions, as well as the signal intensity of GTNPs on an OCT imaging system, were investigated. Visualization of 3D penetration and distribution of O<sub>3</sub> in the biologic tissue was proved for the first time. The quantitative analysis of O<sub>3</sub> diffusion in the anterior chamber of the fish eye revealed a penetration depth of 311 \u03bcm within 172 min. Due to the strong scattering, near-infrared extinction band, and easy functionalization of GTNPs, they could further serve as nanoprobes for 3D OCT or multimodal imaging of other molecules or ions in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instruments of Guangdong Province, School of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Xueqin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instruments of Guangdong Province, School of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Peijun", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instruments of Guangdong Province, School of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Panpan", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School , Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu Shrike", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instruments of Guangdong Province, School of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Changqing", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9895-8679"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instruments of Guangdong Province, School of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jianhua", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28192946", "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04785"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
