This corvid shows a wide trophic spectrum by including fruits, invertebrates, small vertebrates and carcasses in its diet. A camera-trap experiment was carried out to test the effect of different ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) concentrations on potted Vitis vinifera plants, which resulted in different grape consumption rates by suburban birds. The test was performed at an Ozone-Free Air Controlled Exposure (FACE) facility, consisting of nine plots with three ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) levels: AA (ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration); and two elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels, 1.5\u00d7 AA (ambient air with a 50% increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration) and 2.0\u00d7 AA (ambient air with a 100% increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration). Camera-traps were located in front of each treatment area and kept active for 24\u2009h\u2009day<sup>-1</sup> and for 5\u2009days at a time over a period of 3\u2009months to monitor grape consumption by birds.", "We collected a total of 38 videos. Eurasian magpies were the only grape consumers, with a total of 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 passages per hour (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) and no differences across the different O<sub>3</sub> treatments. Grapes in the AA treatment were consumed significantly more quickly than those in the 1.5\u00d7 AA treatment, which in turn, were consumed faster than those in the 2.0\u00d7 AA treatment. At 3\u2009days from the start of treatment, 94%, 53% and 22% berries from the AA, 1.5\u00d7 AA and 2.0\u00d7 AA treatments had been eaten, respectively. When the O<sub>3</sub> was turned off, berries were consumed at the same rate among treatments.", "Increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations limited grape consumption by magpies probably because O<sub>3</sub> acted as a deterrent for magpies, although the lower sugar content recorded in the 2.0\u00d7 AA berries did not affect the consumption when O<sub>3</sub> was turned off. Our results provided valuable insights to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts in suburban environments. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
