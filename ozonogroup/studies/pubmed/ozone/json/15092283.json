Karst.) sensitivity to pollution (two levels of ozone plus acid mist) of growth and development of the fine-root system and of mycorrhizae, have been investigated in two forest soils from areas showing forest decline. This study shows that differences in fine-root biomass and the occurrence of species of ectomycorrhizae were mainly due to prevailing conditions within the acid or calcareous substrate. The pollution treatment resulted in higher numbers of short root tips in only one soil, whereas the percentage of ectomycorrhizal roots with a well-developed mantle was low (10-23%) in both soils, irrespective of exposure of trees to ozone and acid mist. There was no consistent response, with the two clones examined, in terms of mycorrhizal frequency, beaded short roots and renewed growth. Regarding the effects on root growth, data cannot be used unrestrictedly for extrapolation to a more complex field situation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Forstbotanik der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Amalienstrasse 52, 8000 Munich 40, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blaschke", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weiss", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092283", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90049-i", "0269-7491(90)90049-I"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
