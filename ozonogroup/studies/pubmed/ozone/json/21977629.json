The assays were performed by bubbling a gas mixture of oxygen and ozone, with approximately 24 g Nm(-3) of ozone concentration, through a volume of wastewater samples for 20 minutes at 25 degrees C. The removal of dissolved micropollutants such as Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Organic Carbon (TOC) was enhanced by adding periodic pulses of hydrogen peroxide while keeping pH above 8.0 throughout the runs. Removal efficiency ratios in the range of 7-26 mg O3/mg TOC and 0.24 mg O3/ng micropollutants at 5 minutes of ozonation were assessed as reference data to reclaim wastewater from STP. The relation between the extent of TOC removed and ozone doses used was related by a second-order kinetic model in which the time-integrated ozone-hydrogen peroxide concentration was included."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alcala, 28771 Alcala de Henares, Spain. antonio.rodriguez@uah.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosal", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomez", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Calvo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fernandez-Alba", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recycling"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21977629", "10.2166/wst.2011.298"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
