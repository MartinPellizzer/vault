The mass concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions, including anions (Cl<sup>-</sup>, F<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and cations (Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were measured by ion chromatography, and the online ion chromatography-based analyzer MARGA monitored the real-time concentration of particulate nitrate. The results showed that the average concentration of water-soluble ions in Zhengzhou City was (70.9\u00b152.1) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> during the sampling period, and the order of water-soluble ion mass concentrations was NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> > SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> > NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> > Ca<sup>2+</sup> > Na<sup>+</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > Mg<sup>2+</sup> > K<sup>+</sup> > F<sup>-</sup>; NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accounted for 79.9% of total water-soluble ions. The NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration was mainly concentrated in the 0.65-3.3 \u03bcm particle size segment, despite the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration being concentrated in the \u2264 1.1 \u03bcm particle size segment in autumn or summer. Both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> had a bimodal distribution in summer and autumn and were mainly distributed as fine particles. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> showed seasonal variation with a bimodal distribution in summer and a unimodal distribution in autumn. Zhengzhou City had serious ozone pollution in summer, and O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> showed the \"staggered peak\" phenomenon, indicating photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. In autumn, water-soluble inorganic ion concentration in particulate matter was high, and the ratio of[NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]/[SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>] was higher than 0.5. The mobile source is an important source of particles. NOR and SOR peaks were on the 1.1-2.1 \u03bcm particle size segment in summer, whereas those in the 0.65-1.1 \u03bcm particle size segment occurred in autumn. The sulfur gas-to-grain conversion in summer was larger than that of nitrogen, contrary to the result in autumn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qing-Yan", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Qi-She", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shen-Bo", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Liu-Ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628207", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201803102"]}}]}
