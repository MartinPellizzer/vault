Legionellae are ubiquitous contaminants of potable water and can achieve high numbers in the hot-water systems of large buildings such as hospitals. They are present in the mains water supply in small numbers but are amplified considerably in the hospital's hot-water system. This is encouraged by water temperatures below 50 degrees C, areas of stagnation and sludge formation, the presence of amoebae and other bacteria and the materials used in the piping. Formation of aerosols from contaminated water is a major mode of spread of legionellae, but there is evidence to suggest that aspiration is also a mode of entry. Safe levels of legionellae in cooling towers have been defined, but not for hot-water systems. A combination of culture and antigen detection by immunofluorescence offer the best method for enumerating legionellae in environmental samples. Control involves a mixture of physical (heat, UV irradiation, sanitation) and chemical (hypochlorite, ozone) methods combined with good plumbing practice (e.g. arrangement of pumps and calorifiers, elimination of dead-legs). Adequate control can be costly and requires considerable attention to detail."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Liverpool, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hart", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Makin", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Hosp Infect", "NlmUniqueID": "8007166", "ISSNLinking": "0195-6701"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Conditioning"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Cross Infection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Reservoirs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Legionellosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Legionnaires' Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Sanitary Engineering"}], "NumberOfReferences": "43"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1679819", "10.1016/0195-6701(91)90060-l", "0195-6701(91)90060-L"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
