Air pollutants have become an important global public health issue, in recent years, and much epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown that air pollutants are associated with respiratory diseases.", "We comprehensively searched articles published up to 15 November 2022 in PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Database of Chinese sci-tech periodicals, and Wanfang Database. The search strategies were based on keyword combinations related to influenza and air pollutants. The air pollutants included particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Meta-analysis was performed using the R programming language (R4.2.1).", "A total of 2926 records were identified and 1220 duplicates were excluded. Finally, 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. We observed a significant association between partial air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>) and the incidence risk of influenza. The RRs were 1.0221 (95% CI: 1.0093~1.0352), 1.0395 (95% CI: 1.0131~1.0666), 1.007 (95% CI: 1.0009~1.0132), and 1.0352 (95% CI. 1.0076~1.0635), respectively.
