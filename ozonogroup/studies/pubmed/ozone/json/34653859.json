This study aims to explore whether there is a link between O<sub>3</sub> and metabolic health indicators through a viewpoint of inflammatory pathways. 49 metabolically healthy normal-weight (MH-NW) and 39 metabolically healthy obese (MHO) young adults aged 18-26 years were recruited from a panel study with three visits. O<sub>3</sub> exposure were estimated based on fixed-site environmental monitoring data and time-activity diary for each participant. Compared to MH-NW people, MHO people were more susceptible to the adverse effects on metabolic status, including blood pressure, glucose, and lipid indicators when exposed to O<sub>3</sub>. For instance, O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with significant decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increases in C-peptide and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) among MHO people, while only weaker changes in HDL-C and LDL-C among MH-NW people. Mediation analyses indicated that leptin mediated the metabolic health effects in both groups, while eosinophils and MCP-1 were also important mediating factors for the MHO people. Although both with a metabolically healthy status, compared to normal-weight people, obese people might be more susceptible to the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on metabolic status, possibly through inflammatory indicators such as leptin, eosinophils, and MCP-1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
