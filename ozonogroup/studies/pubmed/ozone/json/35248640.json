In recent years, machine learning techniques have attracted increasing attention in O<sub>3</sub> prediction owing to their high efficiency and simple operation. However, the accuracy of predicting the daily O<sub>3</sub> level is low. This study proposed a novel model by coupling long short-term memory neural network with transfer learning (TL-LSTM), with meteorology and pollutant concentration information as the model input. L2 regularization was applied to reduce the risk of overfitting and to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model prediction. Our results indicated that by transferring the knowledge in the model configuration from the hourly LSTM module, TL-LSTM greatly improves the predictability of the daily maximum 8 h average (MDA8) of O<sub>3</sub> in Hong Kong. The coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) increased from 0.684 to 0.783 and the mean square error (MSE) reduced from 1.36 \u00d7 10<sup>-2</sup> to 1.05 \u00d7 10<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, R<sup>2</sup> and MSE were the highest in summer, indicating an under-prediction of peak O<sub>3</sub> levels. This was a result of the limited number of high O<sub>3</sub> days, which did not provide sufficient knowledge for the model to make an accurate prediction. Sobol analysis indicated that wind speed was the most sensitive factor in O<sub>3</sub> prediction, largely due to the development of land-sea breeze circulation which effectively traps pollutants and expedites O<sub>3</sub> formation. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the TL-LSTM in predicting the daily O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Hong Kong. Thus, TL-LSTM can be promulgated into other photochemically active regions to assist in O<sub>3</sub> pollution forecasting and management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
