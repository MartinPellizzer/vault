Recently topical administration of gaseous ozone and its combination with antibiotics through portable systems has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to eradicate commonly found Gram-negative strains of bacteria in wound infections. However, despite the significant impact of ozone in treating the growing number of antibiotic-resistant infections, uncontrolled and high concentrations of ozone can cause damage to the surrounding tissue. Hence, before such treatments could advance into clinical usage, it is paramount to identify appropriate levels of topical ozone that are effective in treating bacterial infections and safe for use in topical administration. To address this concern, we have conducted a series of in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a portable and wearable adjunct ozone and antibiotic wound therapy system. The concurrent ozone and antibiotics are applied through a wound interfaced gas permeable dressing coated with water-soluble nanofibers containing vancomycin and linezolid (traditionally used to treat Gram-positive infections) and connected to a portable ozone delivery system. The bactericidal properties of the combination therapy were evaluated on an ex vivo wound model infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a common Gram-negative strain of bacteria found in many skin infections with high resistance to a wide range of currently available antibiotics. The results indicated that the optimized combination delivery of ozone (4 mg h<sup>-1</sup>) and topical antibiotic (200 \u03bcg cm<sup>-2</sup>) provided complete bacteria eradication after 6 h of treatment while having minimum cytotoxicity to human fibroblast cells. Furthermore, in vivo local and systemic toxicity studies (e.g., skin monitoring, skin histopathology, and blood analysis) on pig models showed no signs of adverse effects of ozone and antibiotic combination therapy even after 5 days of continuous administration. The confirmed efficacy and biosafety profile of the adjunct ozone and antibiotic therapy places it as a strong candidate for treating wound infection with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and further pursuing human clinical trials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette,
