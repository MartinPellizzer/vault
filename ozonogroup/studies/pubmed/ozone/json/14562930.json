In aerobic MBR, MISS and DO were controlled at 3000-3500 mg/L and 0.8 mg/L respectively. Comparing the experimental results of two stages, it was noticed that ozonation did not affect the removal efficiency for organics but had a significant influence on the removals of NH3-N and TN. During the ozonation period of two months, no excess sludge was wasted, and a zero sludge yield was obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. heshengbing@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Sheng-Bing", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bao-Zhen", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yi-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li-Qiu", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14562930"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
