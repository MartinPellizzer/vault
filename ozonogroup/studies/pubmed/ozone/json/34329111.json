The Chick-Watson model-predicted ozone exposure (CT) requirements, showed that higher CT values were needed for CAS- than MBR-treated effluents to achieve a 3-log reduction of each microbial group, i.e., ~30 and 10 gO<sub>3</sub> min gDOC<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Ozonation was efficient in inactivating the examined antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and no bacterial regrowth was observed after 72\u00a0h. The genes abundance decreased significantly by ozone, but an increase in their abundance was detected 72\u00a0h after storage of the treated samples. A very low removal of DOC was achieved and at the same time phyto- and eco-toxicity increased after the ozonation treatment in both wastewater matrices. The gene abundance, regrowth and toxicity results of this study may be of high environmental significance for comprehensive evaluation of ozone and may guide future studies in assessing these parameters for other oxidants/disinfectants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
