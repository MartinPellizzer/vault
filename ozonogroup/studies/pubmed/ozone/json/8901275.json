Repeated two-minute average measurements of ozone were made within five minutes of each other inside and outside of six different school classrooms while children were in the room. Outdoor ozone two-minute average levels varied between 64 and 361 ppb; mean outdoor levels were above 160 ppb for each of the three conditions. Adjusting for outdoor relative humidity, for a mean outdoor ozone concentration of 170 ppb, the mean predicted indoor ozone concentrations were 125.3 (+/- 5.7) ppb with windows/doors open; 35.4 (+/- 4.6) ppb with windows/doors closed, air cleaner on. The mean predicted ratios of indoor to outdoor ozone concentrations were 0.71 (+/- 0.03) with windows/doors open; 0.18 (+/- 0.02) ppb with windows/doors closed, air cleaner off; and 0.15 (+/- 0.02) ppb with windows/doors closed, air cleaner on. As outdoor ozone concentrations increased, indoor ozone concentrations increased more rapidly with windows and doors open than with windows and doors closed. Ozone exposure in Mexican schools may be significantly reduced, and can usually be kept below the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 80 ppb, by closing windows and doors even when ambient ozone levels reach 300 ppb or more."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gold", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Damokosh", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Serrano", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castillejos", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc 1996 Jun;46(6):593"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8901275"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
