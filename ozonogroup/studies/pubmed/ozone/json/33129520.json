In this study, we applied ground- and satellite-based data of five criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO) and meteorological factors from March 8 to May 15, 2020 (before, partial-, and full-lockdown). The generalized additive models (GAMs), wavelet coherence, and random forest (RF) model were employed to explore the relationship between air quality indicators and COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka city. Results show that overall, 26, 20.4, 17.5, 9.7 and 8.8% declined in PM 2.5, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO concentrations, respectively, in Dhaka City during the partial and full lockdown compared to the period before the lockdown. The implementation of lockdown policy for containing COVID-19 transmission played a crucial role in reducing air pollution. The findings of wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence demonstrate no standalone coherence, but interestingly, multiple wavelet coherence indicated a strong short-term coherence among air pollutants and meteorological factors with the COVID-19 outbreak. Outcomes of GAMs indicated that an increase of 1-unit in long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and CO (lag1) was associated with a 2.9% (95% CI: -0.3%, -5.6%), and 53.9% (95% CI: 0.2%, -107.9%) decreased risk of COVID-19 infection rate during the full-lockdown period. Whereas, COVID-19 infection and MT (mean temperature) are modulated by a peak during full-lockdown, which is mostly attributed to contact transmission in Dhaka city. RF model revealed among the parameters being studied, MT, RH (relative humidity), and O<sub>3</sub> were the dominant factors that could be associated with COVID-19 cases during the study period. The outcomes reported here could elucidate the effectiveness of lockdown scenarios for COVID-19 containment and air pollution control in Dhaka city."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
