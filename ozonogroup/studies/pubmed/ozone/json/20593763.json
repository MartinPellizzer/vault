These products are unequivocally identified here as the stereoisomeric (R)-sulfoxides of each parent molecule and characterized by a combination of chemical analysis and an antibacterial activity assay. PG-(R)-sulfoxide, which is approximately 15% as potent as PG itself, is formed in approximately 55% yield, whereas CP-(R)-sulfoxide, which is 83% as active as CP, is formed with a maximum 34% yield. PG-(R)-sulfoxide is recalcitrant toward further oxidation by O3, but readily transformed by hydroxyl radical (HO*) (kHO*,app\"=7.4x10(9) M(-1) s(-1), pH 7), resulting in quantitative elimination of its antibacterial activity. In contrast, CP-(R)-sulfoxide is degraded by both O3 and HO* (kO3,app\"=2.6x10(4) M(-1) s(-1) and kHO*,app\"= 7.6x10(9) M(-1) s(-1), pH 7), leading to quantitative elimination of its antibacterial activity. During ozonation of a secondary municipal wastewater effluent sample (pH 8.1, CDOC=4.0 mg/L, [alkalinity]=3.6 mM as HCO3-) spiked with [PG]0=1 microM, PG-(R)-sulfoxide yields did not exceed 0.15 microM for O3 doses up to 100 microM (4.8 mg/L), but reached 0.47 microM with 10-mM t-BuOH added as a HO* scavenger. In contrast, CP-(R)-sulfoxide yields did not exceed 0.1 microM for the same wastewater spiked with [CP]0=1 microM in either the presence or absence of t-BuOH, indicating that CP-(R)-sulfoxide transformation is governed primarily by direct reaction with O3. These findings suggest that, for a given degree of parent compound transformation, PG-(R)-sulfoxide yields would likely be greatest during ozonation of wastewaters characterized by low O3 demands and high HO* scavenging rates, whereas CP-(R)-sulfoxide yields would be less matrix-dependent. In general, complete deactivation of penicillins during wastewater treatment will likely require higher O3 exposures than necessary for deactivation of cephalosporins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, 8600 Duebendorf, Switzerland. doddm@uw.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dodd", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rentsch", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singer", "ForeName": "Heinz P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohler", "ForeName": "Hans-Peter E", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OBN7UDS42Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Cephalexin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q42T66VG0C", "NameOfSubstance": "Penicillin G"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2010 Nov 15;44(22):8790"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cephalexin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillin G"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20593763", "10.1021/es101061w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
