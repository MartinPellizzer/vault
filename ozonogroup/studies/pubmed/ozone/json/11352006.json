Thus there is a crucial need for reliable methods to measure the fraction of gaseous atmospheric Hg which is in the oxidized Hg(II) form (termed reactive gaseous mercury, RGM). We have developed a novel method for measurement of RGM using a refluxing mist chamber, and we recently reported the results of sampling campaigns for RGM in Tennessee and Indiana. In general, measured RGM levels were about 3% of total gaseous mercury (TGM), and our results support prevailing hypotheses about the nature and behavior of RGM in ambient air. Because its use for RGM is growing, we now report in more detail the development and testing of the mist chamber method. Several styles of mist chambers have been investigated. The most versatile design employs a single nebulizer nozzle and can operate at flows of 15-20 L/min. The water-soluble Hg is collected in ca. 20 mL of absorbing solution, which is then analyzed for Hg(II) by SnCl2 reduction and CVAFS. One-hour samples (ca. 1 m3 of air) generally contain 50-200 pg of RGM. The method detection limit for 1-h samples is approximately 6-10 pg/m3. Thus short sample times can reveal temporal variations in RGM that would not otherwise be observable. The efficiency of collecting RGM in mist chambers is highly dependent on Cl- concentration in the absorbing solution, in keeping with equilibrium calculations. Artifact formation of Hg(II) by oxidation of Hg0 under ozone ambient conditions appears to be sufficiently slow so as to be negligible for the short (ca. 1 h) runs that are typically employed. We observed no significant error from cosampled particles or aerosols in rural nonimpacted air samples. We have developed a simple approach to analyzing mist chamber samples in the field using an automated Hg sampler."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana 47374, USA. wilmers@earlham.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stratton", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindberg", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perry", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11352006", "10.1021/es001260j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
