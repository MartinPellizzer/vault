Higher ozone doses were required to remove organic micropollutants in the effluent wastewater from the high loaded activated sludge process. Further comparison of the micropollutant removal was based on normalized ozone doses, expressed as g\u202fO<sub>3</sub>/g DOC and g\u202fO<sub>3</sub>/g soluble COD (sCOD). A clear difference was noted for the two effluents when the micropollutant removal was normalized by DOC. This difference disappeared almost completely when the removal was linked to ozone doses normalized by sCOD. The dose-response curves for the organic micropollutants were practically linear in the removal range up to 95%. A linear prediction model was developed and compared with literature values to test the transferability of the obtained results. Results from this comparison indicated that the slope of the dose-response functions could be used to predict the removal efficiency of organic micropollutants at a third plant with an average uncertainty of 10%. The modeled ozone requirements were then set in relation to the COD concentrations in the discharged water from approximately 90 Swedish activated sludge treatment plants with and without nitrogen removal. This comparison highlighted the need for a well-functioning biological treatment for an effective ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants. The results in this study suggest that soluble COD should be further explored for design and modeling of ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
