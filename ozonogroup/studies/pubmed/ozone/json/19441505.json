Synthesis of poly(methyl urethane) acrylate oligomer was done with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-MEOH), methyl acrylate, 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, initiator) and dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst. Then 2-MEOH was used for functional chain transfer agent. The structure and property of the synthesized oligomers were characterized by FT-IR, FT-NMR, rheometer, and DSC. In this study, by synthetic method including the addition of 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate, thermal behavior of synthesized material was improved more than that reported in the previous study. Poly(methyl urethane) oligomer can be used for UV curable coatings, inks and adhesives. UV curable coating have high resistance against weather, ozone, aging, frictional wear, and heat. Besides they can absorb the shock and resist rust according to the thickness of film. It is used as an adhesive, paint, optical fiber coating agent, and waterproof agent because of these advantages at the present time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry Pukyong National University, Busan 608-737, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19441505", "10.1166/jnn.2009.c137"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
