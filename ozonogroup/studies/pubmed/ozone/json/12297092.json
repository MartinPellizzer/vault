To study the adverse effects of UV-B radiation on the aquatic biomass, studies were conducted using the aquatic organism Tubifex as a model, as UV-B radiation is known to penetrate into the natural waters. UV-B radiation induced mortality in tubifex and the production of activated oxygen species by these organisms. Alterations in DNA, RNA, protein, glutathione (GSH), hydrogen peroxide H(2)O(2), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBA-RS), ATPase, AChE, GST, and LDH activities in Tubifex at various doses (0-2.0 J) of UV-B radiation were found. LC(50) value for UV-B-induced mortality of Tubifex was 0.80+/-0.15 J and the threshold dose was 0.35+/-0.05 J; mortality began within 3h postirradiation. UV-B dose-dependent production of singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals by Tubifex was observed. DNA, RNA, protein, and GSH contents were found to decrease significantly (P<0.001) while H(2)O(2) and TBA-RS increased (P<0.01) under the influence of UV-B radiation. The activities of ATpase, AChE, and GST enzymes were inhibited (P<0.01) and LDH activity was significantly increased (P<0.001) in Tubifex exposed to UV-B radiation. The results suggest that an increase in UV-B radiation alters several biochemical processes, leading to the mortality of the organism. Tubifex could be useful as a sensitive alternate model for studying UV-B-induced phototoxicity and possible mechanisms of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Photobiology Division, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babu", "ForeName": "G Suresh", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ray", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hans", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Chain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligochaeta"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zooplankton"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12297092", "10.1006/eesa.2002.2184", "S0147651302921846"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
