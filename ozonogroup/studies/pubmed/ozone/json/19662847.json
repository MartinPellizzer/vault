The rate constants of TA with ozone and OH radicals calculated by the relative method are (0.047 +/- 0.010) L x (mol x s)(-1) and 2.28 x 10(9) L x (mol x s)(-1), respectively. The above result was in accordance with the apparent reaction rate constant of ozonation of TA when the process was controlled by chemical reaction. Intermediates detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ion chromatography (IC) included benzoic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid and oxalic acid, therefore the possible destruction pathway of ozonation of TA was proposed on the basis of above results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China. zangxingjie@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Xing-Jie", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Shao-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Chun-An", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6S7NKZ40BQ", "NameOfSubstance": "terephthalic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19662847"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
