In the direct photolysis of MCPA, the quantum yield at 20 degrees C was directly evaluated and a value of 0.150 mol Eins(-1) was obtained in the pH range 5-9, while a lower value of 0.41 x 10(-2) mol Eins(-1) was determined at pH=3. Similarly, for 2,4-D a value of 0.81 x 10(-2) mol Eins(-1) was deduced, independent of the pH of work. The influence of the additional presence of hydrogen peroxide was established in the combined process UV/H2O2, and the specific contribution of the radical pathway to the global photo-degradation was evaluated. The oxidation by ozone and by the combination O3/H2O2 was also studied, with the determination of the rate constants for the reactions of both herbicides with ozone and hydroxyl radicals at 20 degrees C. These rate constants for the direct reactions with ozone were 47.7 and 21.9 M(-1) s(-1) for MCPA and 2,4-D respectively, while the found values for the rate constants corresponding to the radical reactions were 6.6 x 10(9) and 5.1 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Energ\u00e9tica, Universidad de Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain. javben@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benitez", "ForeName": "F Javier", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acero", "ForeName": "Juan L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Real", "ForeName": "Francisco J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roman", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D888C394VO", "NameOfSubstance": "2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15186029", "10.1081/pfc-120035925"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
