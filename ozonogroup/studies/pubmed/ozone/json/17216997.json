Ultraviolet was more efficient than the other two disinfectants at wave length 254 nm where no infective virus was detected after 4 min of UV irradiation in both drinking water and treated effluent. Inactivation by chlorine dose more than 25 mg/L was sufficient for studied viruses in both drinking water and treated effluent. Also virus-seeded drinking water was exposed to ozone for 18 min at ozone rate of 319 mg/L/h to obtain the maximum inactivation of PV3, CoxB4 and HAV but about 20 min of ozone exposure was needed for treated effluent. Physico-chemical parameters were measured before and after disinfection assay. No significant changes were observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Virology Lab, Department of Water Pollution Researches, National Research Centre, 12311 Dokki, Cairo, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Egypt Public Health Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7505602", "ISSNLinking": "0013-2446"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus B, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis A virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17216997"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
