A systematic parameter study, investigating the effect of the ozone inlet concentration, temperature, pH, H(2)O(2) and t-butanol addition in a lab-scale bubble reactor, showed the promising potential of ozonation towards BP3 degradation. pH showed to be a major process parameter, with half-life times (5.1-15.0 min) being more than two times shorter at pH10 compared to neutral and acid conditions. This indicates the important role of hydroxyl radicals as supported by the addition of H(2)O(2) and t-butanol as HO promoter and scavenger, respectively. Ozonation intermediate products were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QqTOF-MS/MS). Demethylation and non-selective HO attack proved to be the major reaction mechanisms. Where available, identified intermediates were confirmed using analytical standards, and concentration profiles along the ozonation process were determined through selective targeted MS/MS analysis. Benzophenone-1 (BP1), also being a UV-filter compound, and 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (DHMB) revealed to be the major BP3 degradation products, showing a maximum concentration at about the half-life time of BP3."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.
