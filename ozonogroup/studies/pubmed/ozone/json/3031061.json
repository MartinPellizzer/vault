It was demonstrated that factors like pH, substrate concentration, and presence of detergent not only greatly influence the total incorporation but also the relative distribution of radioactivity among the isoprenologues. The synthesis was shown to be extremely sensitive to Triton X-100. Substrate concentrations of 1 and 100 microM mostly gave polyprenols with 18 and 20 isoprenes, respectively. At a given substrate concentration, pH 6.5 resulted in shorter polyprenols than did pH 7.5. Ozonolytic fragmentation demonstrated that in the initial phase of incubation, polyprenols are elongated by 1 isoprene residue and saturated to give dolichols. No substantial dephosphorylation of polyprenyl phosphates to the free alcohol occurred. The production of dolichol in vitro was shown to utilize NADH for the saturation event. This seemed to occur concomitantly with the synthesis. alpha-Saturation of polyprenyl-P could not be achieved with the procedures employed. It is proposed that the synthesis of dolichol and dolichyl-P do not share the same terminal steps; saturation and terminal isoprene condensation occur in cooperation; and substrate concentration and pH influence the terminal enzyme(s) and the nature of the final product in the polyprenol biosynthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chojnacki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dallner", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dolichol Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dolichols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0U46U6E8UK", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12698-55-4", "NameOfSubstance": "dolichol monophosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-93-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Octoxynol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S5UOB36OCZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Mevalonic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Dolichol Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Dolichols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mevalonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "NAD"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Octoxynol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3031061", "S0021-9258(18)61315-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
