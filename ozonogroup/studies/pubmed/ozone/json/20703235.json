We hypothesized that oxidative stress (measured as 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2\u03b1), 8-iso-PGF2a), inflammation (highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), hs-CRP) and nitric oxide may be associated with an alteration in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria in otherwise healthy smokers. A total of 649 eligible subjects were classified according to their smoking status. Plasma NOx was measured using ozone-based chemiluminescence, urinary 8-iso-PGF2a was measured using enzyme immunoassay and serum hs-CRP was measured using a latex aggregation nephelometry method. The levels of 8-iso-PGF2a and hs-CRP increased in current smokers (P=0.001 and P=0.029, respectively), although there was not an increase in the NOx level. The prevalence of a high eGFR increased in light smokers (odds ratio (OR) 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-2.17)) and heavy smokers (OR 2.33 (95% CI, 1.06-5.10)) when compared with non- and past smokers (P for trend=0.024). The multivariable-adjusted mean values of the eGFR in current smokers, reported from the lowest to the highest quintiles of hs-CRP levels, were 82.1, 85.1, 86.4 and 88.5\u2009ml per min per 1.73\u2009m\u00b2 (P for trend=0.027). The mean values of proteinuria were 28.6, 34.6, 37.2 and 39.5\u2009mg\u2009g\u207b\u00b9 creatinine (P for trend=0.003). The correlation coefficient between hs-CRP and eGFR was increased significantly (P=0.03) across non- (r=0.03), past (r=-0.17), light (r=0.13) and heavy smokers (r=0.31). In conclusion, cigarette smoking is a risk factor for renal function alteration in healthy smokers and is characterized by a high eGFR and a high urinary protein associated with an increase in the hs-CRP. This finding suggests that hs-CRP may help mediate the alteration of renal function in smokers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sauriasari", "ForeName": "Rani", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakano", "ForeName": "Noriko", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Da-Hong", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takaki", "ForeName": "Jiro", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "BingLing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sugiyama", "ForeName": "Hitoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "Yoshie", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takigawa", "ForeName": "Tomoko", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Noriko", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanbara", "ForeName": "Sakiko", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hitomi", "ForeName": "Yoshiaki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogino", "ForeName": "Keiki", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hypertens Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9307690", "ISSNLinking": "0916-9636"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27415-26-5", "NameOfSubstance": "8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B7IN85G1HY", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprost"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Hypertens Res. 2010 Nov;33(11):1104-5. doi: 10.1038/hr.2010.161", "PMID": "20844542"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprost"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glomerular Filtration Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Style"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Proteinuria"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20703235", "10.1038/hr.2010.154", "hr2010154"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
