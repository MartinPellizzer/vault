Bintje). Plants grown in open-top chambers were exposed to three CO2 (ambient, 550 and 680 \u00b5mol mol-1) and two O3 treatments (ambient and elevated; 25 and 65 nmol mol-1, 8 h day-1 means, respectively) between crop emergence and maturity; plants were also grown in unchambered field plots. Non-destructive measurements of chlorophyll content and visible foliar injury were made for all treatments at 2-week intervals between 43 and 95 days after emergence. Gas exchange measurements were made for all except the intermediate 550 \u00b5mol mol-1 CO2 treatment. Season-long exposure to elevated O3 under ambient CO2 reduced chlorophyll content and induced extensive visible foliar damage, but had little effect on net assimilation rate or stomatal conductance. Elevated CO2 had no significant effect on chlorophyll content, but greatly reduced the damaging impact of O3 on chlorophyll content and visible foliar damage. Light-saturated assimilation rates for leaves grown under elevated CO2 were consistently lower when measured under either elevated or ambient CO2 than in equivalent leaves grown under ambient CO2. Analysis of CO2 response curves revealed that CO2-saturated assimilation rate, maximum rates of carboxylation and electron transport and respiration decreased with time. CO2-saturated assimilation rate was reduced by elevated O3 during the early stages of the season, while respiration was significantly greater under elevated CO2 as the crop approached maturity. The physiological origins of these responses and their implications for the performance of potato in a changing climate are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, LE12 5RD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donnelly", "ForeName": "Alison", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Craigon", "ForeName": "Jim", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Black", "ForeName": "Colin R.", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colls", "ForeName": "Jeremy J.", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landon", "ForeName": "Geoff", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11299015", "10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1110410.x", "ppl1110410"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
