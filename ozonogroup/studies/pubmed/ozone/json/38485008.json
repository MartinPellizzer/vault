The model captured the observed O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD trends and spatial distributions well. From 2013 to 2020, with changes in both anthropogenic emissions and meteorology, the simulated values of O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD in the urban (non-urban) areas of the BTH and YRD regions were 424.8 (330.1) and 309.3 (286.9) days, respectively, suggesting that pollution in non-urban areas also warrants attention. The trends in the simulated values of O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD were -0.14 and -0.15 (+1.18 and +0.81) days yr<sup>-1</sup> in the BTH (YRD) urban and non-urban areas, respectively. Sensitivity simulations revealed that changes in anthropogenic emissions decreased the occurrence of O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD, with trends of -0.99 and -1.23 (-1.47 and -1.92) days yr<sup>-1</sup> in the BTH (YRD) urban and non-urban areas, respectively. Conversely, meteorological conditions could exacerbate the frequency of O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD, especially in the urban YRD areas, but less notably in the urban BTH areas, with trends of +2.11 and +0.30\u00a0days\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, owing to changes in meteorology only. The increases in T2m_max and T2m were the main meteorological factors affecting O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD in most BTH and YRD areas. Furthermore, by conducting sensitivity experiments with different levels of pollutant precursor reductions in 2020, we found that volatile organic compound (VOC) reductions primarily benefited O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD decreases in urban areas and that NO<sub>x</sub> reductions more notably influenced those in non-urban areas, especially in the YRD region. Simultaneously, reducing VOC and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by 50\u00a0% resulted in considerable O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD decreases (58.8-72.6\u00a0%) in the urban and non-urban areas of the BTH and YRD regions. The results of this study have important implications for the control of O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub>PD in the urban and non-urban areas of the BTH and YRD regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
