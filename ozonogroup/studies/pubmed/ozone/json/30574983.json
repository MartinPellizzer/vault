The oxidation of indolo-fused 28-oxo-allobetulin or methyl platanoate with ozone led to a mixture of a quinolone as the major product and a nine-membered 2,3-seco-2-oxolactam and three different types of spiroindoles as byproducts. The formation of quinolone and 2,3-seco-2-oxolactam derivatives could be explained by the standard 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of ozone to the C2(3)-double bond of the triterpene core similar to the products observed in the ozonolysis of indoles in the Witkop-Winterfeldt oxidation (WWO). The formation of spiroindoles was unexpected and could be explained through the 1,2-cycloaddition of ozone to the C2(3)-double bond with consecutive intramolecular rearrangements of the 2,3-epoxy-intermediate. These spiroindoles seem to be novel structures observed in the WWO reaction. The formation of only two isomeric triterpene spiroindolinones was achieved by the oxidation of 2,3-indolo-28-oxo-allobetulin with dimethyldioxirane that could be explained by the rearrangement of the 2,3-epoxy-intermediate. 19\u03b2,28-Epoxy-18\u03b1-olean-28-oxo-2-nor-2,3-4'(1H)-quinolone was the most active against HPV-11 with EC50 0.45 \u03bcM and SI50 322 in a primary assay and SI90 < 10 against HPV-16 in a secondary assay. The oxidative transformations of indolotriterpenoids have great potential for further modifications towards the preparation of new biologically active compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ufa Institute of Chemistry - Subdivision of the Ufa Federal Research Centre of Russian Academy of Sciences, Ufa 450054, Russian Federation. obf@anrb.ru."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khusnutdinova", "ForeName": "Elmira F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kazakova", "ForeName": "Oxana B", "Initials": "OB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lobov", "ForeName": "Alexander N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kukovinets", "ForeName": "Olga S", "Initials": "OS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suponitsky", "ForeName": "Kyrill Yu", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meyers", "ForeName": "Craig B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prichard", "ForeName": "Mark N", "Initials": "MN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Org Biomol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101154995", "ISSNLinking": "1477-0520"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30574983", "10.1039/c8ob02624f"]}}]}
