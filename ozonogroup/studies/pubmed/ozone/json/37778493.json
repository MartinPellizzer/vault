To study the O<sub>3</sub> effect on this perennial crop species under realistic environmental conditions, a three-year experiment was performed using an innovative O<sub>3</sub>-FACE facility located in the Mediterranean climate region, where the target species, Vitis vinifera cv. \"Cabernet sauvignon\", was exposed to three O<sub>3</sub> levels: ambient (AA), 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0ambient (\u00d71.5), and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0ambient (\u00d72.0). A stomatal conductance model parameterization was conducted, and O<sub>3</sub>-exposure (AOT40) and flux-based indices (PODy) were estimated. An assessment of O<sub>3</sub>-induced visible foliar injury (O<sub>3</sub>_VFI) was conducted by estimating VFI_Incidence (percentage of symptomatic leaves per branch) and VFI_Severity (average percentage of O<sub>3</sub>_VFI surface in symptomatic leaves). Biomass parameters were used to assess the cumulative O<sub>3</sub> effect and calculate the most appropriate critical levels (CL) for a 5% yield loss and for the induction of 5, 10, and 15% of O<sub>3</sub>_VFI. We confirmed that the O<sub>3</sub> effect on this grapevine variety VFI was cumulative and that POD<sub>0</sub> values accumulated over the two or three years preceding the assessment were better related to the response variables than single-year values, with the response increasing with increasing O<sub>3</sub> level. The estimated CL for 5% yield loss based on the O<sub>3</sub>-exposure index was 25\u00a0ppm\u00a0h AOT40 and 21 or 23\u00a0ppm\u00a0h for a 10% of VFI_Incidence or VFI_Severity, respectively. The suggested flux-based index value for 5% yield loss was 5.2 POD<sub>3</sub> mmol m<sup>-2</sup>, and for 10% of VFI_Incidence or VFI_Severity, the values were 7.7 or 8.6 POD<sub>3</sub> mmol m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. The results presented in this study demonstrate that O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment for this grapevine varietyproduces consistent and comparable results when using either yield or O<sub>3</sub>_VFI as response parameter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
