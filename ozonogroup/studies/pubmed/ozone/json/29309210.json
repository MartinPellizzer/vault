We aimed to clarify the short-term association between the ambient air pollution and respiratory symptoms among children without asthma, children with asthma not using long-term medications (CA-nonLTM), and those using them (CA-LTM).", "A total of 138 children attending 2 primary schools and 71 children with asthma regularly visiting cooperating medical institutions were recruited. Study participants measured peak expiratory flow (PEF) twice a day and recorded coughing, nasal symptoms, and medication use in a diary. Predicted associations between daily air pollutant concentrations and respiratory symptoms, and PEF were evaluated using case-crossover and generalized estimate equation models.", "Changes in %maxPEF per 10 ppb oxidant (Ox) increase in children without asthma, CA-nonLTM, and CA-LTM were -0.26% (95% CI: -0.49, -0.03), -0.51% (95% CI: -0.89, -0.12), and -0.20% (95% CI: -0.42, 0.01), respectively. The odds ratios for coughing per 10 ppb Ox increase in the Lag0 model were 1.34 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.60), 1.52 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.07), and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.20), respectively. These suggested that the Ox concentration has graded effects on %maxPEF and coughing, in the following descending order, CA-nonLTM, children without asthma, and CA-LTM. The Ox concentration was also positively associated with nasal symptoms in children without asthma and CA-LTM.", "Our results suggest that using long-term medications to manage asthma may play an important role in preventing exacerbation of respiratory symptoms due to air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Center for Environmental Information Science , Tokyo , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hasunuma", "ForeName": "Hideki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Institute for Environmental Studies , Tsukuba , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamazaki", "ForeName": "Shin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Institute for Environmental Studies , Tsukuba , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamura", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Busan St. Mary's Hospital , Busan , South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Yoon Ha", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d National Hospital Organization Fukuoka Hospital , Fukuoka , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "Rintaro", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Hiroshima City Asa Hospital , Hiroshima , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amimoto", "ForeName": "Yuko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f University of Occupational and Environmental Health , Kitakyusyu , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Askew", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d National Hospital Organization Fukuoka Hospital , Fukuoka , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Odajima", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peak Expiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29309210", "10.1080/02770903.2017.1369988"]}}]}
