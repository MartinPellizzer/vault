However, sludge organic matter (SOM) influences PAHs degradation during ozone treatment is still rarely understood. In this study, we investigated such an influence with the aid of solid-state <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and the corresponding two-dimensional correlation analysis (2D-COS) strategy. The results showed that the degradation of SOM macromolecules in the order of aromatic substances > aliphatic carbon > \u03b1 carbon > amides groups > O-alkyl upon ozone treatment. Moreover, the PAHs removal efficiency was positively correlated with the aromaticity of sludge (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84-0.98), while negative associated with its aliphaticity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.81-0.95). Lastly, humic acid (HA) was used as a proxy of aromatic SOM to further explore their interaction with PAHs in sludge matrix. The results revealed that freely dissolved (HA-D) and suspended particulates (HA-S) imposed distinctively different influence on ozone-based PAHs degradation. The HA-S facilitated the elimination of PAHs by 7.95 \u00b1 0.11%, while those HA-D reduced the removal efficiency by 16.70 \u00b1 0.13%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
