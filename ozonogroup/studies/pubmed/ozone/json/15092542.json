There were five treatments in the study: charcoal-filtered air, constant exposure to 0.05 ppm O3 (131 microg m(-3)) daily. fluctuating exposure to 0.08 ppm O3 on three alternate days, cluster exposure to 0.08 ppm O3 on three consecutive days, and peak exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 on two consecutive days. Exposures lasted 4 h and produced an average weekly exposure-period concentration of approximately 0.05 ppm in the O3-addition treatments and 0.025 ppm in the charcoal-filtered treatment. Exposures began on June 23 and terminated on September 8. Plants were harvested weekly and assessed for the number, area, and dry mass of leaves; dry mass of stems; dry mass of roots; the number of pods; and the incidence of foliar O3 injury. Yield was assessed at the end of the study. There were no consistent differences between the plants receiving charcoal-filtered air and those receiving O3 exposure. Significant differences were detected among the treatments for several of the growth variables assessed at the interim harvests, but in the final two harvests these differences had mostly disappeared. There were no significant effects of the O3-addition treatments on yield when compared to the plants receiving charcoal-filtered air. This indicates that there were no cumulative impacts on plants exposed to 0.12 ppm O3 for 4 h on two consecutive days followed by filtered air compared to plants receiving charcoal-filtered air. The seasonal 7-h average concentrations of O3 in the peak and filtered air treatments were approximately 0.040 and 0.025 ppm, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohut", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laurence", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colavito", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092542", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90026-7", "0269749188900267"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
