It is possible to obtain direct structural information as to these double bond positions using tandem mass spectrometry after collisional activation of the carboxylate anions of an acetone adduct at each of the double bond positions formed by the photochemical Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi reaction with acetone. This reaction can be carried out by exposing a small portion of an inline fused silica capillary to UV photons from a mercury vapor lamp as the sample is infused into the electrospray ion source of a mass spectrometer. Collisional activation of [M - H]<sup>-</sup> yields a series of reverse Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi reaction product ions that essentially are derived from cleavage of the original carbon-carbon double bonds that yield an isopropenyl carboxylate anion corresponding to each double bond location. Aldehydic reverse Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi product ions are much less abundant as the carbon chain length and number of double bonds increase. The use of a mixture of D<sub>0</sub>/D<sub>6</sub>-acetone facilitates identification of these double bonds indicating product ions as shown for arachidonic acid. If oxygen is present in the solvent stream undergoing UV photoactivation, ozone cleavage ions are also observed without prior collisional activation. This reaction was used to determine the double bond positions in a 20:3 fatty acid that accumulated in phospholipids of RAW 264.7 cells cultured for 3 days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9430-6515"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Denver , Anschutz Medical Campus, 12801 E. 17th Ave., Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Robert C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Juntendo University School of Medicine , 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan."}], "LastName": "Okuno", "ForeName": "Toshiaki", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Denver , Anschutz Medical Campus, 12801 E. 17th Ave., Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Christopher A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4711-6361"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Denver , Anschutz Medical Campus, 12801 E. 17th Ave., Aurora, Colorado 80045, United States."}], "LastName": "Barkley", "ForeName": "Robert M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28719189", "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02375"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
