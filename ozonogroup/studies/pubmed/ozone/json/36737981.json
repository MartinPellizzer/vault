Therefore, it is important for the healthy human diet to investigate pesticide residue behavior. To explore the relationship between pesticide residue behavior and physicochemical properties, the distribution of ten pesticides and one metabolite on grape peel and pulp was examined and the results showed that pesticides with low octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) were more likely to be transferred to the pulp as the harvest interval increases. The removal methods were ranked according to pesticide removal effectiveness as follows: peeling\u00a0>\u00a0ozone water washing\u00a0>\u00a0tap water washing. Furthermore, the logKow played a key role in pesticide transfer rates during the juicing and winemaking. Notably, drying was the process of increasing pesticide residues. Additionally, the prediction models for the PFs of the pesticides in the juicing and winemaking processes were constructed as PFj\u00a0=\u00a00.952-0.116logKow (r\u00a0=\u00a00.886) and PFw\u00a0=\u00a00.736-0.143logKow (r\u00a0=\u00a00.959) by stepwise regression analysis. The prediction models recommended that Kow could be used to predict pesticide residues in grape juice and wine, which can predict the effect of pesticide physicochemical properties on PFs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
