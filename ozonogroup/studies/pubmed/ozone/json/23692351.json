Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characteristics demonstrated that the room-temperature sol-gel derived MoO3 thin films exhibited excellent uniformity, unchanged chemical structure, and high work function. For the first time, the novel solution-processed MoO3 thin films were successfully applied as the hole injection layers (HILs) for solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The efficiencies of the resulting OLEDs were comparable or even higher than that of the device using PEDOT:PSS as the HIL. More importantly, the lifetimes of the solution-processed OLEDs are improved by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. This study should provide a potential approach to develop low-cost, high-performance, and long-lifetime OLEDs for practical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, P R China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jiangshan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Changsheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Dongge", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23692351", "10.1021/am4007319"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
