BCB solid solutions in the structure of 2D nanosheets are achieved involving the etching of BiOBr \"micro-flowers\" with HCl at different concentrations, allowing a removal ratio of FF up to 97.3\u00a0% within 1\u00a0h, superior to bare BiOBr and bare BiOCl. A strengthened synergistic effect between photocatalysis and ozonation is substantiated, where the separation of photo-induced charge transfer is accelerated, the band gap is tuned and the utilization efficiency of ozone is enhanced. This facilitates the production of reactive oxygen species identified as \u2022OH, \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> that will attack the FF molecule for degradation based on three pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
