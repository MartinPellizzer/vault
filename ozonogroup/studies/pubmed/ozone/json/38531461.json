In this study, we investigated the mixing states of OOM particles by identifying several oxygenated species along with the distributions of secondary organic carbon (SOC) during both clean and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)-polluted periods in July and September of 2022 in Guangzhou, China. OOM-containing particles accounted for 57\u00a0% and 49\u00a0% of the total detected single particles in July and September, respectively. Most of the OOM particles were internally mixed with sulfate and nitrate, while elemental carbon and hydrocarbon species were absent. Despite the higher SOC/OC ratio in September (81\u00a0%) than it in July (72\u00a0%), comparative investigations of the mass spectra, diurnal patterns, and distributions of OOM particles revealed the same composition and aging states of OOMs in two O<sub>3</sub> pollution periods. As the O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased from the clean to the polluted periods, the ratio of SOC to OC increased along with the relative abundance of secondary OOM particles among total OOM particles. In contrast, the relative abundance of OC-type OOM particles gradually decreased, indicating the conversion of hydrocarbon species into OOMs as the SOC/OC ratio increased. Both the bulk analysis of SOC from filter measurement and the mixing states of OOM particles suggested that OOM production and degree of oxidation were higher in the O<sub>3</sub>-polluted periods than in the clean periods. These results elucidate the effects of O<sub>3</sub> pollution on the OOM formation process and offer new perspectives for the joint investigation of SOA production based on filter sampling and single-particle measurements."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
