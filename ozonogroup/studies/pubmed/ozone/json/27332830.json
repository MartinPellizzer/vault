It is also well known that ozone is used to treat different types of water due to its effectiveness in water purification and for its oxidation potential. This process of ozonation is becoming progressively an alternative technology and is inscribed in a sustainable development perspective in Algeria. In this regards, the present paper investigates the wastewater treatment process by ozone produced by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) under high potential. Three (DBD) ozone generators of cylindrical form have been used, at a laboratory scale, for treating collected samples from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Sidi-Bel-Abbes located in the west of Algeria. Our experimental results reveal the efficiency of this type of treatment on the basis of the physicochemical analysis (pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, heavy metals) and microbial analysis downstream of the WWTP, which showed a high rate of elimination of all the parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Laboratory of Environmental Sciences Study and Materials (LESEM), Faculty of Sciences, University of Oran, Oran 31000, Algeria E-mail: nadia_ramdani@ymail.com."}], "LastName": "Ramdani", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Department, Laboratory Mechanics of Structures and Solids (LMSS), Faculty of Technology, University of Sidi-Bel-Abbes, SBA-22000, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Lousdad", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Applications of Plasma, Electrostatics, Electromagnetics (APELEC), University of Sidi-Bel-Abbes, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Tilmatine", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Applications of Plasma, Electrostatics, Electromagnetics (APELEC), University of Sidi-Bel-Abbes, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Nemmich", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27332830", "10.2166/wst.2016.131"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
