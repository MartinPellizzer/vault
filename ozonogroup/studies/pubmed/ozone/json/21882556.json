The presence of a Mn-Ce-O catalyst in ozonation enhances the biodegradability and improves the degradation at low pH values. However, a high content of carbonyl compounds adsorbed on the recovered solid indicates some limitations for real-scale application. A commercial Fe2O3-MnOx catalyst shows higher activity as well as higher stability concerning carbon adsorption, but the leaching of metals is larger than for Mn-Ce-O. Regarding the heterogeneous Fenton-like route with an Fe-Ce-O catalyst, even though a high activity and stability are attained, the intermediates are less biodegradable than the original compounds, indicating that the resulting effluent cannot be conducted to an activated sludge post-treatment. The highest enhancement of effluent biodegradability is obtained with the classic homogeneous Fenton's process, with the BOD5/COD ratio increasing from 0.32 to 0.80. This process was scaled up and the treated effluent is now safely directed to a municipal wastewater treatment plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Engenharia dos Processos Qu\u00edmicos e Produtos da Floresta, GERSE, Group on Environmental, Reaction and Separation Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, P\u00f3lo II-Rua Silvio Lima, 3030-790 Coimbra, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Rui C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Adri\u00e1n M T", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castro-Silva", "ForeName": "S\u00e9rgio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gar\u00e7\u00e3o-Nunes", "ForeName": "Paulo", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quinta-Ferreira", "ForeName": "Rosa M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenton's reagent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Aerobic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21882556", "10.1080/09593330.2010.523439"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
