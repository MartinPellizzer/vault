The heterogeneous reactions of sea-salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br-) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br-, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton-electron transfer process at the air\u2012water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br- and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate under light conditions was up to 1.55\u00d71010 molecules\u00b7cm-2\u00b7s-1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br- activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br- activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton-electron transfer process in Br2 production."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Wiley\u2010VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Earth and Environmental Science and Department of Chemistry, 251 Hayden Hall, 240 South 33rd Street, 19104-6316, Philadelphia, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yiqun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Technology, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhuo", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Technology, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiarong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Qingqxin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shuying", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tianzeng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yonghong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Biwu", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Technology, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, CHINA."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiuhui", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physical Chemistry Blas Cabrera, Deartment of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate, SPAIN."}], "LastName": "Saiz-Lopez", "ForeName": "Alfonso", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, CHINA."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Angew Chem Int Ed Engl", "NlmUniqueID": "0370543", "ISSNLinking": "1433-7851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38989722", "10.1002/anie.202409779"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
