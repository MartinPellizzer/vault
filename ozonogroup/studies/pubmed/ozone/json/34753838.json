In each group, the root canals were endodontically prepared by using the corresponding irrigant and stored in DA; after 7 days, they were cleared and cleaned with the corresponding cleaning solution. The fiberglass pins were cemented by using self-adhesive cement. After 7 days, the roots were sectioned (six discs each) and submitted to the push-out test. The type of fracture was analyzed with a 4.5x stereoscopic magnifying glass. The data were analyzed by the analysis of variance and the Tukey test at a 5% significance level.", "The OA/OA (11.67), HP/HP (11.21), and HP/OA (9.71) groups showed the highest mean push-out bond strength (MPa) in the cervical third.
