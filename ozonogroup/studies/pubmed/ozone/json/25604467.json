A survey on satisfaction and perceived health problems was given to 1001 users at 20 indoor swimming pools which used different water treatment methods [chlorine, bromine, ozone, ultraviolet lamps (UV) and salt electrolysis]. The findings suggest that there is a greater probability of perceived health problems, such as eye and skin irritation, respiratory problems and skin dryness, in swimming pools treated with chlorine than in swimming pools using other chemical treatment methods. Pools treated with bromine have similar, although slightly better, results. Other factors, such as age, gender, time of day of use (morning and afternoon) and type of user (competitive and recreational), can also affect the probability of suffering health problems. For all of the above, using combined treatment methods as ozone and UV, or salt electrolysis produces a lower probability of perceived health problems and greater satisfaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Sports Science , Universidad Europea , Madrid , Spain."}], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Luna", "ForeName": "\u00c1lvaro", "Initials": "\u00c1"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Sport Sciences Institute , Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela University , Madrid , Spain."}], "LastName": "Burillo", "ForeName": "Pablo", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Sports Science , Universidad Europea , Madrid , Spain."}], "LastName": "Felipe", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Luis", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Economics and Finance , University of Castilla-La Mancha , Ciudad Real , Spain."}], "LastName": "del Corral", "ForeName": "Julio", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d IGOID Research Group , University of Castilla-La Mancha , Toledo , Spain."}], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Unanue", "ForeName": "Jorge", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d IGOID Research Group , University of Castilla-La Mancha , Toledo , Spain."}], "LastName": "Gallardo", "ForeName": "Leonor", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Sport Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101146739", "ISSNLinking": "1536-7290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Personal Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming Pools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Quality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25604467", "10.1080/17461391.2014.1001877"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
