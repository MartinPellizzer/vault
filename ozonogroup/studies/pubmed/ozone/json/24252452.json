At the intake of each plant (raw water), the occurrence of carboxylic acids varied according to the quality of the water source although in both cases 13 acids were detected at average concentrations of 6.9 and 4.7\u00a0\u03bcg/L (in winter). In the following steps in each treatment plant, the concentration patterns of these compounds differed depending on the type of disinfectant applied. Thus, after disinfection by chloramination, the levels of the acids remained almost constant (average concentration, 6.3\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and four new acids were formed (butyric, 2-methylbutyric, 3-hydroxybenzoic and 2-nitrobenzoic) at low levels (1.1-5\u00a0\u03bcg/L). When ozonation/chlorination was used, the total concentration of the carboxylic acids in the raw water sample (4.7\u00a0\u03bcg/L) increased up to 6 times (average concentration, 26.3\u00a0\u03bcg/L) after disinfection and 6 new acids (mainly aromatic) were produced at high levels (3.5-100\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Seasonal variations of the carboxylic acids under study showed that in both plants, maximum levels of all the analytes were reached in the coldest months (autumn and winter), aromatic acids only being found in those seasons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
