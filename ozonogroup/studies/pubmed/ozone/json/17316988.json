As an ozonation process starts, the ozone-containing gas is introduced and transferred into to the solution. The target PAHs in the solution would be then eliminated via both the gas stripping and ozonation decomposition. The RPB, which provides high gravitational force by adjusting the rotational speed, is employed as a novel ozone contactor. The naphthalene (NAP) and Brij 30 are chosen as the model pollutant and surfactant. Note that the experiments with different concentrations of NAP, Brij 30, and inlet gas ozone are performed for the further investigation. The residual NAP, effluent dissolved oxygen and ozone, and off-gas ozone concentrations are simultaneously monitored. As a result, the removal of NAP in the RPB is remarkably efficient compared with the convectional contactors because of its greater mass transfer coefficient. Moreover, the removal efficiency of NAP is found significantly dependent on the concentrations of NAP, Brij 30, and inlet gas ozone. It takes about several minutes to reach the steady state under the conditions of this study. In addition, it suggests employing RPBs as ozone contacting devices for the high removal efficiency of NAP. Consequently, the present study is useful for the practicable understanding of application of RPBs for the ozonation of PAHs in surfactant-containing solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Safety, Health, and Environmental Engineering, Lan-Yang Institute of Technology, I-Lan 261, Taiwan. cychiu@mail.fit.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Chun-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi-Hung", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yi-Haw", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0AWH8BFG9A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polidocanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2166IN72UN", "NameOfSubstance": "naphthalene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polidocanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17316988", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.01.068", "S0304-3894(07)00130-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
