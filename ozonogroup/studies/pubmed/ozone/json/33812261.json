In the control group osteotomy procedure was performed with saline irrigation and in the experimental group irrigation was done with ozonated water at 25\u00a0\u00b5g/mL concentration, along with ozone gas. Clinical assessment was done by evaluating C-reactive Protein (CRP) for inflammation, pain using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and tissue wound healing using wound healing index. Side effects, if any, were noted.", "Postoperative increment in CRP levels was 0.10 and 0.63\u00a0mg/dl in Experimental and control groups respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). At 24-hr, 48-hr and 7\u00a0day post-operative intervals mean VAS scores for pain were significantly higher in Control group as compared to that in Experimental Group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). At day 7, mean VAS scores for pain were 3.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63 and 37.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.17 in Experimental and Control groups respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).
