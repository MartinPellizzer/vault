The results show that the monthly variation of atmospheric ozone are obvious that the minimum values appear in January from less than 10 x 10(-9) on ground to less than 50 x 10(-9) on upper layer (2 km), but the maximum values appear in June from 85 x 10(-9) on ground to more than 90 x 10(-9) on upper layer. The seasonal variation is also clear that the least atmospheric ozone concentration is in winter and the most is in summer, but variety from ground to upper layer is largest in winter and least in summer. According to the type of outline, the outline of ozone concentration is composite of three types which are winter type, summer type and spring-autumn type. The monthly ozone concentration in different heights is quite different. After analyzing the relationship between ozone concentration and meteorological factors, such as temperature and humidity, we find ozone concentration on ground is linear with temperature and the correlation coefficient is more than 85 percent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Middle Atmosphere and Global Environment Observation, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China. zongxm@mail.iap.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zong", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Geng-Chen", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong-Bin", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Pu-Cai", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xuan", "ForeName": "Yue-Jian", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18290492"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
