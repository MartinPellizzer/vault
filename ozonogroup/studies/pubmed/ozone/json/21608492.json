This study examined the effectiveness of biofiltration in removing propylene and butylene as separate compounds. Specific objectives were (1) to measure maximum removal efficiencies for propylene and butylene and the corresponding microbial acclimation times, which will be useful in the design of future biofilters for removal of these compounds; (2) to compare removal efficiencies of propylene and butylene for different ratios of compost/hard wood-chip media; and (3) to identify the microorganisms responsible for propylene and butylene degradation. Two laboratory-scale polyvinyl chloride biofilter columns were filled with 28 in. of biofilter media (compost/wood-chip mixtures of 80:20 and 50:50 ratios). Close to 100% removal efficiency was obtained for propylene for inlet concentrations ranging from 2.9 x 10(4) to 6.3 x 10(4) parts per million (ppm) (232-602 g/m3-hr) and for butylene for inlet concentrations ranging from 91 to 643 ppm (1.7-13.6 g/m3-hr). The microbial acclimation period to attain 100% removal efficiency was 12-13 weeks for both compounds. The lack of similar microbial species in the fresh and used media likely accounts for the long acclimation time required. Both ratios of compost/wood chips (80:20 and 50:50) gave similar results. During the testing, media pH increased slightly from 7.1 to 7.5-7.7. None of the species in the used media that treated butylene were the same as those in the used media that treated propylene, indicating that different microbes are adept at degrading the two compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rani", "ForeName": "Madhu", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sattler", "ForeName": "Melanie L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25167-67-3", "NameOfSubstance": "butylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AUG1H506LY", "NameOfSubstance": "propylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofouling"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21608492", "10.3155/1047-3289.61.5.527"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
