Due to its chemical and recalcitrant properties, MTBE has caused groundwater contamination worldwide. A laboratory-scale biofilter made of a natural fiber (kenaf) mat and inoculated with MTBE-degrading microorganisms, was evaluated for MTBE removal efficiency. Operational parameters of oxygen flow rate, hydraulic retention time (HRT), yeast extract and initial MTBE concentration were varied and MTBE removal efficiencies determined. Four kinetic models were evaluated to describe the MTBE removal in the reactor. Formaldehyde and tertiary butyl alcohol (the most two reported MTBE biodegradation byproducts) were not found in the effluent; instead, carbon dioxide was monitored as the end product based on the results of a metabolic mass balance evaluation. Toxicity of treated effluent was evaluated by employing the Microtox acute toxicity test and comparing that to the influent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Sciences Department, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, 1440 Canal Street New Orleans, Louisiana 70112-2715, USA. chihyanghu@netscape.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acuna-Askar", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Englande", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vibrio"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14979542"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
