To aid this assessment, it is necessary to model the space-time behavior of ozone for predicting summaries of ozone across spatial domains of interest and for the detection of long-term trends at monitoring sites. These trends, adjusted for the effects of meteorological variables, are needed for determining the effectiveness of pollution control programs in terms of their magnitude and uncertainties across space. This paper proposes a space-time model for daily 8-hour maximum ozone levels to provide input to regulatory activities: detection, evaluation, and analysis of spatial patterns of ozone summaries and temporal trends. The model is applied to analyzing data from the state of Ohio which has been chosen because it contains a mix of urban, suburban, and rural ozone monitoring sites in several large cities separated by large rural areas. The proposed space-time model is auto-regressive and incorporates the most important meteorological variables observed at a collection of ozone monitoring sites as well as at several weather stations where ozone levels have not been observed. This problem of misalignment of ozone and meteorological data is overcome by spatial modeling of the latter. In so doing we adopt an approach based on the successive daily increments in meteorological variables. With regard to modeling, the increment (or change-in-meteorology) process proves more attractive than working directly with the meteorology process, without sacrificing any desired inference. The full model is specified within a Bayesian framework and is fitted using MCMC techniques. Hence, full inference with regard to model unknowns is available as well as for predictions in time and space, evaluation of annual summaries and assessment of trends."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mathematics, Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sahu", "ForeName": "Sujit K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gelfand", "ForeName": "Alan E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holland", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES014843", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 ES014843-01A2", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Stat Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "01510020R", "ISSNLinking": "0162-1459"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bell ML, McDermott A, Zeger SL, Samet JM, Dominici F.
