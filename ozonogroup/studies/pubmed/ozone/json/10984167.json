Fifteen-minute treatments using either warm water (40 degrees C) or ozonated cold water (10 degrees C) were conducted to compare prerinse cleaning potential of soiled metal plates. The chemical oxygen demand determination was performed on extracted organic material from treated metal plates. Results indicated that the ozone treatment removed 84% of soil from metal plates versus 51% soil removal by the warm water treatment, but the effectiveness of the two treatments did not differ (P > 0.05). Cleaning effects were visualized using scanning electron microscopy at 200x and 2000x magnification. The amount of soil film present on stainless steel metal surfaces was visibly lower on ozonated treatments versus on warm water treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal & Veterinary Sciences, Clemson University, SC 29634-0361, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guzel-Seydim", "ForeName": "Z B", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wyffels", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greene", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bodine", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Stainless Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dairying"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stainless Steel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10984167", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75061-2", "S0022-0302(00)75061-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
