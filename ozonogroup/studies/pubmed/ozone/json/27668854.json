Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the key precursors of O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (an important component of PM<sub>2.5</sub>), have a critical influence on atmospheric chemistry and subsequently affect regional and global climate. Thus, VOCs have been extensively studied in many cities and regions in China, especially in the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions where photochemical smog pollution has become increasingly worse over recent decades. This paper reviews the main studies conducted in China on the characteristics and sources of VOCs, their relationship with O<sub>3</sub> and SOA, and their removal technology. This paper also provides an integrated literature review on the formulation and implementation of effective control strategies of VOCs and photochemical smog, as well as suggestions for future directions of VOCs study in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
