Three lake waters and a wastewater were assessed. With p-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a hydroxyl radical ((\u2022)OH) probe compound, we experimentally determined the rate constants of organic matter of the selected waters for their reaction with (\u2022)OH (k(OH,DOM)), which varied from 2.0 \u00d7 10(4) to 3.5 \u00d7 10(4) L mgC(-1) s(-1). Based on these data we calculated (\u2022)OH scavenging rates of the various water matrices, which were in the range 6.1-20 \u00d7 10(4) s(-1). The varying scavenging rates influenced the required oxidant dose for the same degree of micropollutant transformation. In ozonation, for 90% pCBA transformation in the water with the lowest scavenging rate (lake Z\u00fcrich water) the required O(3) dose was roughly 2.3 mg/L, and in the water with the highest scavenging rate (D\u00fcbendorf wastewater) it was 13.2 mg/L, corresponding to an energy consumption of 0.035 and 0.2 kWh/m(3), respectively. The use of O(3)/H(2)O(2) increased the rate of micropollutant transformation and reduced bromate formation by 70%, but the H(2)O(2) production increased the energy requirements by 20-25%. UV/H(2)O(2) efficiently oxidized all examined micropollutants but energy requirements were substantially higher (For 90% pCBA conversion in lake Z\u00fcrich water, 0.17-0.75 kWh/m(3) were required, depending on the optical path length). Energy requirements between ozonation and UV/H(2)O(2) were similar only in the case of NDMA, a compound that reacts slowly with ozone and (\u2022)OH but is transformed efficiently by direct photolysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
