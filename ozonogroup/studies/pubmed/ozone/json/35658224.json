Recent studies have found that ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) has protective effect on MIRI caused by the anterior descending branch of the ligated left coronary artery. However, whether O<sub>3</sub> preconditioning has the same protective effect on global MIRI and the mechanism underlying this clinical treatment remains elusive. Here, we hypothesized that O<sub>3</sub> preconditioning (O<sub>3</sub>P) could protect rabbit heart against global MIRI in vitro by up-regulating HIF-1\u03b1. Rabbits were treated intraperitoneally with O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> mixture with different concentrations and then injected with YC-1 (inhibitor of HIF-1\u03b1) before the establishment of the global MIRI model using the Langendorff isolated heart perfusion apparatus. We investigated the effects of O<sub>3</sub> preconditioning on cardiac systolic function, myocardial infarction, inflammatory response, mitochondrial function, myocardial pathological changes and arrhythmias. We found that the heart with O<sub>3</sub> preconditioning significantly increased HR, LVDP and IL-10 expression, and decreased IL-6 expression, CK-MB, cTnT and cTnI concentration, myocardial infarction area, myocardial pathological injury and the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Meanwhile, the level of HIF-1\u03b1 was significantly increased. However, after treatment of specific inhibitor of HIF-1\u03b1, the protective effect of O<sub>3</sub> preconditioning was reversed completely. Our data indicates that O<sub>3</sub> preconditioning has protective effect on MIRI and this protective effect is positively associated with dosage of O<sub>3</sub>. Energy metabolism disorder is the initial stage of MIRI and up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 plays an important role in reducing mitochondrial dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
