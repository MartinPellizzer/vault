However, the features of O<sub>3</sub> regional transport and source contributions in SCB are poorly understood. In this study, ambient measurements, ERA5 reanalysis dataset, IASI O<sub>3</sub> column, and the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) modeling system coupled with the Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) module were used to investigate the formation mechanism and sources of a severe O<sub>3</sub> episode in spring 2020 over the SCB. In the first stage of the O<sub>3</sub> episode, a high-pressure system persisted over the western SCB and caused northeasterly wind fields, leading to enhanced regional transport from the northern boundary with the O<sub>3</sub> contribution from the boundary exceeding 50% across the SCB. As the synoptic pattern evolved, southeasterly winds dominated the SCB and the stagnant zone over the Chengdu Plain confined O<sub>3</sub> originating from the southern SCB and Chongqing city, leading to the accumulation of precursors and elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels. During the O<sub>3</sub> episode, transportation and industrial sources were major contributors to O<sub>3</sub> formation especially for the Chengdu Plain and Chongqing city. In addition, the O<sub>3</sub>-rich air mass in the nocturnal residual layer that formed over Chongqing city was transported to the Chengdu Plain through southeastern corridor at 400-1600m above ground-level under the prevailing southeasterly winds. With sunrise and the development of the atmospheric boundary layer, the O<sub>3</sub>-rich air mass in the residual layer (RL) was entrained to the ground-level via vertical mixing, which further enhanced O<sub>3</sub> pollution across the Chengdu Plain. Our results revealed the mechanism of regional transport via northeastern and southeastern corridors during an O<sub>3</sub> episode and demonstrated the need for joint emission regulation across the SCB to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
