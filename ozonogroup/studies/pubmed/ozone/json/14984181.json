Ozonotherapy is used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of this atherosclerotic complication, but there are still no properly designed studies to show the clinical effectiveness of this approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of ozonated autohemotherapy on walking ability and the subjective clinical experience of hemodialyzed patients with peripheral arterial disease.", "Ten subjects with intermittent claudication (Fontain II stage) received the cycle of ozonated autohemotherapy with ozone concentration of 50 microg/ml and the cycle of oxygen autohemotherapy as a control in a cross-over, single-blind manner. Pain-free distance and maximal walking distance were measured using a standardized march test on a treadmill. The efficacy of therapy was assessed subjectively by patients on a five-degree scale.", "Significant prolongation of maximal waking distance after ozonated autohemotherapy was found, as compared to the baseline (by 30.5%) and to the oxygen control (by 22.7%) (p<0.01 and p<0.03). There was also significant increase in pain-free distance after ozonated autohemotherapy, as compared to the baseline (by 71.7%) and to the oxygen control (by 62.8%) (p<0.02 and p<0.03 respectively). In a subjective assessment (questionnaires) 90% of patients reported clinical improvement relative to the baseline after ozonated autohemotherapy as compared to 40% after the oxygen-control treatment (p<0.025).", "We demonstrated that ozonated autohemotherapy might prolong walking ability and attenuate subjective clinical signs of ischemia in patients with peripheral arterial disease treated regularly with hemodialysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Biedunkiewicz", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tylicki", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nieweglowski", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burakowski", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rutkowski", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Artif Organs", "NlmUniqueID": "7802649", "ISSNLinking": "0391-3988"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Transfusion, Autologous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intermittent Claudication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Peripheral Vascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Renal Dialysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Walking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14984181", "10.1177/039139880402700107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
