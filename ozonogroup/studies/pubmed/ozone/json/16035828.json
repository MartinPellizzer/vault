Deeply rooted in the recently derived numerator-denominator-connected (NDC) expansion for the ground-state energy [K. Kowalski and P. Piecuch, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 074107 (2005)], LR-CCSD(T) approximations use, in analogy to the completely renormalized CCSD(T) (CR-CCSD(T)) approach, the three-body moments in constructing the noniterative corrections to the energies obtained in CC calculations with singles and doubles (CCSD). In contrast to the CR-CCSD(T) method, the LR-CCSD(T) approaches discussed in this paper employ local denominators, which assure the additive separability of the energies in the noninteracting system limit when the localized occupied spin-orbitals are employed in the CCSD and LR-CCSD(T) calculations. As clearly demonstrated on several challenging examples, including breaking the bonds of the F2, N2, and CN molecules, the LR-CCSD(T) approaches are capable of providing a highly accurate description of the entire potential-energy surface (PES), while maintaining the characteristic N(7) scaling of the ubiquitous CCSD(T) approach. Moreover, as illustrated numerically for the ozone molecule, the LR-CCSD(T) approaches yield highly competitive values for a number of equilibrium properties including bond lengths, angles, and harmonic frequencies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "William R.
