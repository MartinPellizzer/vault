In chronological order, key aspects related to epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, classification, clinic, diagnosis and treatment are highlighted, according to extensive literature. It is postulated that according to modern scientific provisions, Fournier gangrene is a private clinical model of critical conditions in surgery, which is characterized by progressive purulent-necrotic lesion and putrefactive decay of soft tissue and fascial structures and is accompanied by phenomena of systemic endotoxicosis (sepsis) and high mortality, varying from 35 to 76-86%. It is declared that the trigger pathogenetic mechanism of the development of FG is disseminated thrombosis of the microcirculatory bed of the superficial fascia of the scrotum due to intravascular invasion of various strains of causative microbes. The methods of clinical, laboratory and instrumental diagnostics and methods of treatment are described, taking into account modern achievements of evidence-based medicine. Based on a multifactorial analysis of literature data and their own experience, the authors stated that the cornerstone that completely affects the outcome of treatment and prognosis of the disease is a multidisciplinary approach to solving diagnostic and therapeutic and tactical tasks with the participation of doctors of related specialties (surgeon, resuscitator, radiologist, cardiologist, coloproctologist, urologist, microbiologist). It is shown that the unshakable priority of treating patients with FG is still urgent surgical intervention in the format of \"aggressive surgery\", which provides for extremely wide excision of necrotic and non-viable tissues, followed by programmed (stage-by-stage) rehabilitation necrectomy. The issues of laser irradiation and hydropressive wound treatment with ozonated saline solution are touched upon. Adjuvant wound treatment using vacuum therapy and hyperbaric oxygenation are given."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan."}], "LastName": "Aliyev", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan."}], "LastName": "Aliev", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Urologiia", "NlmUniqueID": "100900900", "ISSNLinking": "1728-2985"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fournier Gangrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Gangrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcirculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Debridement"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Scrotum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36382828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
