It started at 09:30 a.m. and lasted until 12:14 LST with coverage of between 76.8% and 93.1% of the sun. The observed atmospheric effects of the eclipse are presented. It was found that from the onset of the eclipse, solar radiation was reduced by as much as 88.1 approximately 89.9% at the present research centre. Also, during the eclipse, air temperature decreased slightly or remained almost unchanged. After the eclipse, however, it rose by 2.5 to 4.5 degrees C at observed stations. Meanwhile, relative humidity increased and wind speeds were lowered by the eclipse. Ground-level ozone was observed to decrease during the event."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korea Centre for Atmospheric Environment Research, Khangnae, Cheongwon-Cheongju, 363-891 South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Yong Seung", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hak Sung", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choo", "ForeName": "Seung Ho", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Air Qual Atmos Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101317801", "ISSNLinking": "1873-9318"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Anderson RC, Keefer DR.
