This study investigated the effects of indoor office activities on particulate matter of less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, assessing their potential impact on human health. Measurements of indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were taken every 24\u00a0h during the working days in five office environments located in a semi-urban area. As a comparison, the outdoor concentrations were derived from the nearest Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Station. The results showed that the average 24\u00a0h of indoor and outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were 3.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.82\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 17.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.58\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> respectively, while for O<sub>3</sub> they were 4.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.52\u00a0ppb and 21.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.22\u00a0ppb respectively. During working hours, the range of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were 1.00\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> to 6.10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> while for O<sub>3</sub> they were 0.10\u00a0ppb to 38.0\u00a0ppb. The indoor to outdoor ratio (I/O) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was <1, thus indicating a low infiltration of outdoor sources. The value of the hazard quotient (HQ) for all sampling buildings was <1 for both chronic and acute exposures, indicating that the non-carcinogenic risks are negligible. Higher total cancer risk (CR) value for outdoors (2.67E-03) was observed compared to indoors (4.95E-04) under chronic exposure while the CR value for acute exposure exceeded 1.0E-04, thus suggesting a carcinogenic PM<sub>2.5</sub> risk for both the indoor and outdoor environments. The results of this study suggest that office activities, such as printing and photocopying, affect indoor O<sub>3</sub> concentrations while PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are impacted by indoor-related contributions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
