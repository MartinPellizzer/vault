The objective of the present study was to assess the changes in lymphocyte subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after single and repeated ozone exposures. Twenty-three healthy subjects underwent single exposures to 200 ppb ozone or filtered air (FA), as well as repeated exposures to 200 ppb ozone on four consecutive days, each during 4 h of intermittent exercise. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 20 h after the single exposure or the last of the repeated exposures. Lymphocytes were identified by sideward scatter and CD45 expression, and their subsets by eight different panels of antibodies. Checksums were calculated to assess the validity of the results. The percentage and the absolute number of lymphocytes, mostly comprising T-lymphocytes (CD2+; overall mean 98.8%), increased after single (P < 0.05; each), but not after repeated ozone exposure, compared with FA (7.4 vs 5.8 vs 6.5%; 680 vs 419 vs 301 x 10(3)). In addition, we observed small but statistically significant changes in the proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations. The percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes increased after single (P < 0.05) and repeated ozone exposure (P < 0.01), whereas the percentage of CD8+ cells decreased after repeated exposure (P < 0.05). The proportion of activated lymphocytes (CD25+) was elevated after repeated, compared with single, ozone exposure (P < 0.01), and the percentages of natural killer (NK) cells were decreased after both single (P < 0.05) and repeated (P < 0.01) exposures. Our data suggest that single but not repeated ozone exposures cause a change in absolute numbers of lymphocytes in BALF, whereas the proportions of lymphocyte subsets are affected by single as well as repeated exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krankenhaus Grosshansdorf, Zentrum f\u00fcr Pneumologie und Thoraxchirurgie, Germany. o.holz@pulmoresearch.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holz", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00f6ttcher", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Timm", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koschyk", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abel", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gercken", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magnussen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00f6rres", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Int Arch Occup Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7512134", "ISSNLinking": "0340-0131"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD4 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD4 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Subsets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11401015", "10.1007/s004200000216"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
