For donor strains of plasmids, Pseudomonas aeruginosa RM 2046 harboring the self-transmissible plasmid R68 and RM 2021 harboring the cloning vector R1162, Escherichia coli C 600 ML 4903 and ML 1410 harboring the self-transmissible plasmid Rts-1 and RP4, and E. coli JM 109 harboring the cloning vector pBR 322 were used. The curing rate showed a tendency to increase with treatment time in a L-shaped curve for each plasmid DNA. The rates reached steady state after more than 5-10 minutes of the chlorination and ozone treatment, or 5-10 seconds of the UV treatment, independent of the treatment intensity. It became clear by use of replica technique that effective curing took place by chlorination for Rts-1, R1162 and pBR322, by ozone treatment for R68, and by UV treatment for PR4, respectively. Of the three disinfection treatments excellent curing effect occurred with chlorination, as more than 90% of the curing rate was obtained by that treatment for all donor strains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Ube College."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "19130150R", "ISSNLinking": "0546-1766"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Bacterial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HL6A2XXU5D", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium peroxymonosulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Containment of Biohazards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2132391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
