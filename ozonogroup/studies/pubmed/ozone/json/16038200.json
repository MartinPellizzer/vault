To monitor the efficiencies of destruction samples were taken during the treatment period of 120 min. After sample concentration by C18-solid phase extraction (SPE) and desorption MS, coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) or electrospray interface (ESI) was applied for detection. No elimination of PFOS was observed while HFOSA-glycinic acid and AOP treated non-ionic surfactants were eliminated by oxidation. Degradation products could be detected and identified. So PFOS was observed during HFOSA-glycinic acid oxidation. Polyethylene glycols (PEG) and PEG methyl ethers were generated from non-ionic fluorinated surfactants beside their oxidation products--aldehydes and acids--all identified by tandem (MS-MS) or multiple stage mass spectrometry (MSn). AOP treatment of FAEO blend resulted in a mixture of partly fluorinated alcohols, separated and identified using GC-MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Siedlungswasserwirtschaft, RWTHAachen University, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany. schroeder@isa.rwth-aachen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schr\u00f6der", "ForeName": "Horst F", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meesters", "ForeName": "Roland J W", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16038200", "10.1016/j.chroma.2005.02.070", "S0021-9673(05)00329-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
