The main objective of this study was to identify the processes affecting time variations of PM levels on a day-to-day and seasonal basis. From March to October PM levels at rural, urban, and industrial sites vary as a function of the concatenation of Atlantic air mass advections (Atlantic episodes with low PM levels) and regional circulations (regional events with high PM levels, very often associated with high ozone levels), which favor the aging of air masses in the Western Mediterranean basin. During these regional episodes, PM is transported from urban/industrial to rural sites by meso-scale circulations. From November to February low PM levels are recorded at rural sites, and variations in PM levels at urban/industrial sites are governed by the successive occurrence of Atlantic episodes and local urban/industrial pollution events. The African dust outbreaks take place throughout the year and may induce PM levels to increase simultaneously in large areas of the Iberian peninsula. The difference between PM concentrations measured at urban and rural sites experiences a seasonal trend similar to that of levels of NO(x) and CO, which is characterized by a winter maximum due to the higher frequency of intensive local urban pollution events. However, maximum PM levels are recorded in summer at rural sites owing to the frequent occurrence of regional episodes. Furthermore, in three years of the study period (1997, 1998, and 2000), a second-order PM maximum was also recorded at rural sites in March owing to intensive African dust outbreaks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera, CSIC, Lluis Sol\u00e9 i Sabar\u00eds s/n, 08028, Barcelona, Spain. srodriguez@ija.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Sergio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Querol", "ForeName": "Xavier", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alastuey", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9s", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Viana", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda-Mar", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mantilla", "ForeName": "Enrique", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12564890", "10.1021/es020106p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
