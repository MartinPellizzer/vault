The inclusion of halogen-ozone chemistry in atmospheric box models actually closes the approximately 50% gap between estimated and measured ozone losses in the marine boundary layer. The additional source of gaseous halogens is deemed to involve previously unaccounted for reactions of O(3)(g) with sea surface water and marine aerosols. Here, we report that molecular iodine, I(2)(g), and iodine monoxide radical, IO(g), are released ([I(2)(g)] > 100[IO(g)]) during the heterogeneous reaction of gaseous ozone, O(3)(g), with aqueous potassium iodide, KI(aq). It was found that (1) the amounts of I(2)(g) and IO(g) produced are directly proportional to [KI(aq)] up to 5 mM and (2) IO(g) yields are independent of bulk pH between 2 and 11, whereas I(2)(g) production is markedly enhanced at pH < 4. We propose that O(3)(g) reacts with I(-) at the air/water interface to produce I(2)(g) and IO(g) via HOI and IOOO(-) intermediates, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Yosuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yabushita", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawasaki", "ForeName": "Masahiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enami", "ForeName": "Shinichi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19530668", "10.1021/jp903486u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
