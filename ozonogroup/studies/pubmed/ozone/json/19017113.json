The accumulating evidence for the significant effects of ozone pollutant on crop and forest yield situate ozone as one of the most important environmental stress factors that limits plant productivity worldwide. Today, transcriptomic approaches seem to give the best coverage of genome level responses. Therefore, microarray serves as an invaluable tool for global gene expression analyses, unravelling new information about gene pathways, in-species and cross-species gene expression comparison, and for the characterization of unknown relationships between genes. In this review we summarize the recent progress in the transcriptomics of ozone to demonstrate the benefits that can be harvested from the application of integrative and systematic analytical approaches to study ozone stress response. We focused our consideration on microarray analyses identifying gene networks responsible for response and tolerance to elevated ozone concentration. From these analyses it is now possible to notice how plant ozone defense responses depend on the interplay between many complex signaling pathways and metabolite signals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University, Miedzychodzka 5, 60-371 Poznan, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludwikow", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadowski", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "J Integr Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101250502", "ISSNLinking": "1672-9072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}], "NumberOfReferences": "95"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19017113", "10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00738.x", "JIPB738"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
