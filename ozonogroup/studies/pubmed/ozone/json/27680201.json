We investigated the multiphase ozonolysis of \u03b1-terpineol, an oxygenated derivative of limonene, and found that the reaction products and kinetics differ from the gas-phase ozonolysis of \u03b1-terpineol. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopies along with GC-MS identified the aqueous ozonolysis reaction products as trans- and cis-lactols [4-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuran-3-yl)butan-2-one] and a lactone [4-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-(3-oxobutyl)-valeric acid gamma-lactone], which accounted for 46%, 27%, and 20% of the observed products, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide was also formed in 10% yield consistent with a mechanism involving decomposition of hydroxyl hydroperoxide intermediates followed by hemiacetal ring closure. Multiphase reaction kinetics at gaseous ozone concentrations of 131, 480, and 965 parts-per-billion were analyzed using a resistance model of net ozone uptake and found the second-order rate coefficient for the aqueous reaction of \u03b1-terpineol + O<sub>3</sub> to be 9.9(\u00b13.3) \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Multiphase ozonolysis will therefore be competitive with multiphase oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozonolysis of gaseous \u03b1-terpineol. We also measured product yields for the heterogeneous ozonolysis of \u03b1-terpineol adsorbed on glass, NaCl, and kaolinite, and identified the same three major products but with an increasing lactone yield of 33, 49, and 55% on these substrates, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Drew University , Madison, New Jersey 07940, United States."}], "LastName": "Leviss", "ForeName": "Dani H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Drew University , Madison, New Jersey 07940, United States."}], "LastName": "Van Ry", "ForeName": "Daryl A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Drew University , Madison, New Jersey 07940, United States."}], "LastName": "Hinrichs", "ForeName": "Ryan Z", "Initials": "RZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27680201", "10.1021/acs.est.6b03612"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
