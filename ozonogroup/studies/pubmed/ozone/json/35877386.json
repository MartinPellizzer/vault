Mercury oxidation by atomic bromine in the Arctic and the upper atmosphere is well established, but less is understood about oxidation pathways in conditions of anthropogenic photochemical smog. Many have observed rapid increases in oxidized mercury under polluted conditions, but it has not been clearly demonstrated that these increases are the result of local mercury oxidation. We measured elemental and oxidized mercury in an area that experienced abundant photochemical activity (ozone >100 ppb) during winter inversion (i.e., cold air pools) conditions that restricted entrainment of air from the oxidized mercury-rich upper atmosphere. Under these conditions, oxidized mercury concentrations decreased day-upon-day, even as ozone and other pollutants increased dramatically. A box model that incorporated rapid kinetics for reactions of elemental mercury with ozone and OH radical overestimated observed oxidized mercury, while incorporation of slower, more widely accepted reaction rates did not. Our results show that rapid gas-phase mercury oxidation by ozone and OH in photochemical smog is unlikely."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8493-9522"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bingham Research Center, Utah State University, Vernal, Utah 84078, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Utah State University, Logan, Utah 84322, United States."}], "LastName": "Lyman", "ForeName": "Seth N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bingham Research Center, Utah State University, Vernal, Utah 84078, United States."}], "LastName": "Elgiar", "ForeName": "Tyler", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9306-2037"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Science, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada 89557, United States."}], "LastName": "Gustin", "ForeName": "Mae Sexauer", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Science, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada 89557, United States."}], "LastName": "Dunham-Cheatham", "ForeName": "Sarrah M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0099-7715"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bingham Research Center, Utah State University, Vernal, Utah 84078, United States."}], "LastName": "David", "ForeName": "Liji M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2796-6043"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of the Environment, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35877386", "10.1021/acs.est.2c02224"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
