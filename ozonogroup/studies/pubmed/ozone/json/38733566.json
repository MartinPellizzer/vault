To derive the lockdown impact on air quality, the observations are compared to the equivalent periods in the last 2 years. An observation-based model is used to investigate the atmospheric oxidation capacity change during lockdown. OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are simulated, which are elevated by 42, 220, and 277%, respectively, during the lockdown period, mainly due to the reduction in nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>). However, the radical turnover rates, i.e., OH oxidation rate L(OH) and local ozone production rate P(O<sub>3</sub>), which determine the secondary intermediates formation and O<sub>3</sub> formation, only increase by 24 and 48%, respectively. Therefore, the oxidation capacity increases slightly during lockdown, which is partly attributed to unchanged alkene concentrations. During the lockdown, alkene ozonolysis seems to be a significant radical primary source due to the elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. This unique data set during the lockdown period highlights the importance of controlling alkene emission to mitigate secondary pollution formation in Chengdu and may also be applicable in other regions of China given an expected NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reduction due to the rapid transformation to electrified fleets in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3808-1964"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control (Peking University), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Zhaofeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hefan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yina", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Danlin", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Qinwen", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control (Peking University), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xuefei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9425-9520"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control (Peking University), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Keding", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control (Peking University), College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuanhang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38733566", "10.1021/acs.est.3c08761"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
