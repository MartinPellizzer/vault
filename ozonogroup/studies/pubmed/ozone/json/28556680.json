The aim of the study was to determine the influence of population size of inoculated pathogen on its inactivation by gaseous ozone treatment during vacuum cooling. Spinach leaves were spot inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 at approximate initial populations of 10<sup>8</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, and 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/g. Inoculated leaves were vacuum cooled (28.5 inHg; 4\u00b0C) in a custom-made vessel and then were subjected to a gaseous ozone treatment under the following conditions: 1.5 g of ozone per kg of gas mixture, vessel pressure at 10 lb/in<sup>2</sup> gauge, 94 to 98% relative humidity, and 30 min of holding time at 9\u00b0C. Treatment of the leaves, having the aforementioned inocula, decreased E. coli populations by 0.2, 2.1, and 2.8 log CFU/g, respectively, compared with the inoculated untreated controls. Additionally, spinach leaves were inoculated at 1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g, which approximates natural contamination level, and the small populations remaining after ozone treatment were quantified using the most-probable-number (MPN) method. Vacuum and ozone sequential treatment decreased this E. coli O157:H7 population to <3 MPN/g (i.e., greater than 3-log reduction). Resulting log reductions were greater (P < 0.05) at the lower rather than the higher inoculum levels. In conclusion, treatment of spinach leaves with gaseous ozone is effective against pathogen loads comparable to those found in naturally contaminated fresh produce, but efficacy decreases as inoculum level increases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, The Ohio State University, 2015 Fyffe Road, Columbus, Ohio 43210."}], "LastName": "Yesil", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, The Ohio State University, 2015 Fyffe Road, Columbus, Ohio 43210."}], "LastName": "Kasler", "ForeName": "David R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "En", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, The Ohio State University, 2015 Fyffe Road, Columbus, Ohio 43210."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Microbiology, The Ohio State University, 2015 Fyffe Road, Columbus, Ohio 43210."}], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Ahmed E", "Initials": "AE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Packaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Density"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Spinacia oleracea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28556680", "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-284", "S0362-028X(22)09799-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
