The process is initiated in some undefined manner, possibly through weak two-photon O(2) dissociation, which results in a small amount of O(3) being generated. As soon as any O(3) is present, it strongly absorbs the 248-nanometer radiation and dissociates to vibrationally excited ground state O(2) (among other products), with a quantum yield of 0.1 to 0.15. During the laser pulse, a portion of these molecules absorb a photon and dissociate, which results in the production of three oxygen atoms for one O(3) molecule destroyed. Recombination then converts these atoms to O(3), and thus O(3) production in the system is autocatalytic. A deficiency exists in current models of O(3) photochemistry in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, in that more O(3) iS found than can be explained. A detailed analysis of the system as it applies to the upper atmosphere is not yet possible, but with reasonable assumptions about O(2) vibrational distributions resulting from O(3) photodissociation and about relaxation rates of vibrationally excited O(2) a case can be made for the importance of incuding this mechanism in the models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slanger", "ForeName": "T G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jusinski", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Black", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gadd", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17731442", "10.1126/science.241.4868.945", "241/4868/945"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
