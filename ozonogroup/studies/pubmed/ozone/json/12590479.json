This study was developed in a solution at 100 ppm of mancozeb and ETU concentration over the course of 60 min. Two different oxidizing agents used in this study were (1) ozone at 3 ppm and (2) chlorine dioxide at 20 ppm. Ozone was continuously provided throughout the course of the reaction. Degradation products were detected with high-resolution GC-MS. The total analysis time was 4 min per sample combined with rapid GC separation and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). Hydrolysis of mancozeb led to m/z 144 ion fragmentation, which is 5-imidazoledithiocarboxylic acid, as a major degradation product. ETU showed M(+) 102, which corresponds to its mass, indicating this compound was stable in distilled water and did not undergo hydrolysis during 60 min. The average retention times of mancozeb and ETU were approximately 181-189 and 210-230 s, respectively. Ozonation of mancozeb produced ETU as a major product. Treatment of ETU with ozone produced several degradation compounds. From prolonged ozonation, the CS(2) or CS group was removed. Overall, several byproducts identified were M(+) 60, M(+) 84, M(+) 163, M(+) 117, and M(+) 267 by ozone and M(+) 117, M(+) 86, and M(+) 163 by chlorine dioxide treatment. Several of these have been reported, but others have never been reported previously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Institute for Environmental Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Eun-Sun", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cash", "ForeName": "Jerry N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zabik", "ForeName": "Matthew J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12427-38-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Maneb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24FOJ4N18S", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenethiourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8061YMS4RM", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorine dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R0HY55EB9E", "NameOfSubstance": "mancozeb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X1FSB1OZPT", "NameOfSubstance": "Zineb"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenethiourea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Maneb"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zineb"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12590479", "10.1021/jf020764t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
