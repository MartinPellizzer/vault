Experiments were performed at pH 2, 6 and 12 to determine the rate constants for the reaction of protonated, undissociated and dissociated paraben with ozone. The rate constants for the reaction of ozone with dissociated parabens (3.3 \u00d7 10(9)-4.2 \u00d7 10(9)M(-1)s(-1)) were found to be 10(4) times higher than the undissociated parabens (2.5 \u00d7 10(5)-4.4 \u00d7 10(5)M(-1)s(-1)) and 10(7) times higher than with the protonated parabens (1.02 \u00d7 10(2)-1.38 \u00d7 10(2)M(-1)s(-1)). The second-order rate constants for the reaction between parabens with hydroxyl radicals were found to vary from 6.8 \u00d7 10(9) to 9.2 \u00d7 10(9)M(-1)s(-1). Characterization of degradation by-products (DBPs) formed during the ozonation of each selected parabens has been carried out using GCMS after silylation. Twenty DBPs formed during ozonation of selected parabens have been identified. Hydroxylation has been found to be the major reaction for the formation of the identified DBPs. Through the hydroxylation reaction, a variety of hydroxylated parabens was formed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
