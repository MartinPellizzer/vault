Consistent with previously reported trends, the rotational distribution is shifted to higher rotational states with decreasing wavelength. We observe highly suppressed odd rotational state populations due to a strong \u039b-doublet propensity. The measured rotational distribution is in agreement with classical trajectory calculations for the <i>v</i> = 0 products, although the distribution is slightly narrower than predicted. The spatial anisotropy follows the previously observed trend of decreasing \u03b2 with increasing photon energy with \u03b2 = 0.72 \u00b1 0.14 for <i>v</i> = 0, <i>j</i> = 38. As expected for a triatomic molecule, the <i>v</i>-<i>j</i> correlation is consistent with <i>v</i> perpendicular to <i>j</i>, but the measured correlation is nonlimiting due, in part, to rotational and translational depolarization. The <i>j</i>-dependent line width of the O<sub>2</sub>(a <sup>1</sup>\u0394<sub>g</sub>) REMPI spectrum is also discussed in connection with the lifetime of the resonant O<sub>2</sub>(d <sup>1</sup>\u03a0<sub>g</sub>) state due to predissociation via the II <sup>1</sup>\u03a0<sub>g</sub> valence state."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8518-0316"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas77842, United States."}], "LastName": "Aardema", "ForeName": "Megan N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2790-3467"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan49401, United States."}], "LastName": "McBane", "ForeName": "George C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0795-796X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas77842, United States."}], "LastName": "North", "ForeName": "Simon W", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36129835", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c04832"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
