However, the effect of air pollution on the prevalence of AR in children is controversial. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and the prevalence of AR in Chinese children. <b>Methods:</b> This study, in China, included 160,356 students ages 0-18 years who completed a questionnaire about the accuracy of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The effect of different air pollutants on the prevalence rate were evaluated by meta-analysis. Also, it evaluated the effect of different air pollutants on the prevalence rate. <b>Results:</b> The differences in the effects of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082) exposure (combined odds ratio [OR<sub>combined</sub>] 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.05]; p = 0.010) and nitrogen dioxide (NO\u2082) exposure (OR<sub>combined</sub> 1.11 [95% CI, 1.05-1.18]; p = 0.0006) on the risk of childhood AR was statistically significant. The effect of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of <10 \u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) exposure on the risk of childhood AR was statistically significant (OR<sub>combined</sub> 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]; p < 0.001), the effect of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure on the risk of childhood AR was statistically significant (OR<sub>combined</sub> 1.15 [95% CI, 1.03-1.29]; p = 0.02), and the effect of ozone exposure on the risk of childhood AR was not statistically significant (OR<sub>combined</sub> 0.98 [95% CI, 0.67-1.41]; p = 0.13). <b>Conclusion:</b> NO\u2082, SO\u2082, PM<sub>2.5,</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were associated with the prevalence of AR in Chinese children. PM<sub>2.5</sub> had the highest correlation with AR prevalence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shipeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qinwei", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuting", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Junwen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Kaixi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qinxiu", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xinrong", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Allergy Asthma Proc", "NlmUniqueID": "9603640", "ISSNLinking": "1088-5412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36065105", "10.2500/aap.2022.43.220044"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
