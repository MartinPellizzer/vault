The most common bisphenol, bisphenol A (BPA), despite being endocrine disruptive and estrogenic, is still not fully banned worldwide, leading to continued human exposure via particles in air, dust, and surfaces in both outdoor and indoor environments. While its abundance is well documented, few studies have addressed the chemical transformations of BPA, the properties of its reactive products, and their toxicity. Here, the first gas-surface multiphase ozonolysis experiment of BPA thin films, at a constant ozone mixing ratio of 100 ppb, was performed in a flow tube for periods up to 24 h. Three transformation products involving the addition of 1, 2, and 3 oxygen atoms to the molecule were identified by LC-ESI-HRMS analyses. Exposure of indoor air to thin BPA surface films and BPA-containing thermal paper over periods of days validated the flow tube experiments, demonstrating the rapid nature of this multiphase ozonolysis reaction at atmospherically relevant ozone levels. Multiple transformation pathways are proposed that are likely applicable to not only BPA but also emerging commercial bisphenol products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8155-2832"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1396-527X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yufeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Pranav", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Processes Research Section, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Liggio", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2777-0588"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "MLT3645I99", "NameOfSubstance": "bisphenol A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38349611", "10.1021/acs.est.3c08932"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
