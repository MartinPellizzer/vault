The source contribution of ambient VOCs resolved by positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was comparable with emission inventories, and the location of VOCs sources were speculated by potential source contribution function (PSCF). 17.5 Gg anthropogenic VOCs was emitted in Panjin and Yingkou in July 2019 with potential to form 54.7 Gg-O<sub>3</sub> estimated by emission inventories. The average VOC mixing ratios of 47.1, 26.7, and 16.5 ppbv was observed at XLT, PP, and XRD sites, respectively. Petroleum industry (22 %), organic chemical industry (21 %), and mobile vehicle emission (19 %) were identified to be the main sources contributing to O<sub>3</sub> formation at XLT site by PMF, while it is organic chemical industry (33 %) and solvent utilization (28 %) contributed the most at PP site. Taking the subdivided source contributions of emission inventories and source locations speculated by PSCF into full consideration, organic raw chemicals manufacturing, structural steel coating, petroleum refining process, petroleum products storage and transport, off-shore vessels, and passenger cars were identified as the key anthropogenic sources. High O<sub>3</sub>-formation contribution sources, organic chemical industry and solvent utilization were located in the industrial parks at the junction of the two cities and the southeast of Panjin, and petroleum industry distributed in the whole Panjin and offshore areas. These results identify the key VOCs species and sources and speculate the potential geographical location of sources for precisely controlling ground-level O<sub>3</sub> along the Liaodong Bay."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
