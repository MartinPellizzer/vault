Increasing the CO(2) concentration from 350 to 560 micromol mol(-1) at 17 degrees C air temperature increased the dry weight of the main leaves, main stem, branches and root. The mean relative growth rate (RGR) was increased 10% by CO(2) enrichment, while increasing the O(3) concentration from 7 to 62 nmol mol(-1) decreased the RGR by 9%. The relative biomass distribution between the different plant components was not significantly affected by the CO(2) concentration irrespective of the O(3) concentration. No significant interactions between CO(2) and O(3) concentration were found except on leaf size, which was stimulated more by elevated CO(2) concentration at high, compared to low, O(3) levels. In another experiment, elevated CO(2) (700 micromol mol(-1)) significantly increased the dry weight of the different plant components, and more at 20 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Raising the CO(2) concentration increased the RGR by 5 and 10% at 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively. CO(2) enrichment increased the branch dry weight relatively more than the dry weight of the other plant parts. Increasing the CO(2) concentration or temperature increased the plant height and stem diameter, however, no interactions between CO(2) and temperature were found."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture and Crop Science, Agricultural University of Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortensen", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091583", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)p4165-k", "0269-7491(94)P4165-K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
