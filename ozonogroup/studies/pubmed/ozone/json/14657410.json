A complementation test revealed that the obtained mutant was allelic to the ozone-sensitive radical-induced cell death1-1 (rcd1-1). Therefore, this mutant was named rcd1-2. rcd1-2 was recessive and nearly 4-fold more resistant to methyl viologen than wild type. It exhibited a higher tolerance to short-term UV-B supplementation treatments than the wild type: UV-B-induced formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was reduced by one-half after 24 h of exposure; the decrease in quantum yield of photosystem II was also diminished by 40% after 12 h of treatment. Furthermore, rcd1-2 was tolerant to freezing. Steady-state mRNA levels of plastidic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and stromal ascorbate peroxidase were higher in rcd1-2 than in wild type, and the mRNA level of the latter enzyme was enhanced by UV-B exposure more effectively in rcd1-2. UV-B-absorbing compounds were more accumulated in rcd1-2 than in wild type after UV-B exposure for 24 h. These findings suggest that rcd1-2 methyl viologen resistance is due to the enhanced activities of the AOS-scavenging enzymes in chloroplasts and that the acquired tolerance to the short-term UV-B exposure results from a higher accumulation of sunscreen pigments. rcd1 appears to be a mutant that constitutively shows stress responses, leading to accumulation of more pigments and AOS-scavenging enzymes without any stresses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0810 Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujibe", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saji", "ForeName": "Hikaru", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arakawa", "ForeName": "Keita", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yabe", "ForeName": "Naoto", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takeuchi", "ForeName": "Yuichi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "Kotaro T", "Initials": "KT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PLG39H7695", "NameOfSubstance": "Paraquat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freezing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heat-Shock Response"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Paraquat"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abarca D, Rold\u00e1n M, Mart\u00edn M, Sabater B (2001) Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Cvi shows an increased tolerance to photo-oxidative stress and contains a new chloroplastic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase isoenzyme.
