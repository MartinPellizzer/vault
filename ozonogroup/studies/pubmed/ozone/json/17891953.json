The results indicated that the removal rates were enhanced by increasing ozone dose, and O3 exposures of only 63.6 microg/L were calculated to achieve > or = 92.0% EDs removal efficiency. The presence of bicarbonate (0 - 100 mg/L) inhibited EDs ozonation. Furthermore, the EDs removal rates increased significantly as pH increased. The five apparent rate constants (20 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C) of ozone with the five EDs were in the range of (1.67 - 3.89) x 10(6)L (mol s) (-1) at neutral pH (pH approximately 7.0) and (0.93 approximately 1.75) x 10(9) L (mol s)(-1) at basic pH (pH > 10.6). It was indicated that the five EDs were removed rapidly by O3 in water. At the same time, the elementary reaction ozone rate constants (20 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C) were calculated, and the reactivity of ozone with ionized EDs [i.e. 1.21 x 10(9) - 3.81 x 10(9) L (mol s)(-1)] was 10(3) - 10(4) times higher than with neutral EDs [i.e. 7.62 x 10(5) - 2.55 x 10(6) L (mol s)(-1)]. The comparative test of EDs ozonation under different water quality conditions indicated that the removal rates of EDs in filtrated water and river water were reduced 26.5% - 50.3% and 57.3% - 72.0% respectively compared with the case using ultrapurified water as the background. It showed that organics in real water would compete with EDs for ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. liuguifang@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Gui-fang", "Initials": "GF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Qing-dong", "Initials": "QD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xu-chun", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gui-bai", "Initials": "GB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Estrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17891953"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
