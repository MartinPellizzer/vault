Daily residential air pollutant exposure assessments were performed by extracting grid data (spatial resolution: 1\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km) from validated datasets. We employed the conditional logistic regression model to quantify the associations and excess outpatient visits.", "The results of the single-pollutant models showed that each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposures was significantly associated with a 3.14\u00a0% (95\u00a0% confidence interval: 2.47\u00a0%, 3.81\u00a0%) and 0.88\u00a0% (0.49\u00a0%, 1.26\u00a0%) increase in odds of outpatient visits for ADs, respectively. These associations remained robust in 2-pollutant models. The proportion of outpatient visits attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposures was up to 7.20\u00a0% and 8.93\u00a0%, respectively. Older adults appeared to be more susceptible to PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, especially in cool season, and subjects with recurrent outpatient visits were more susceptible to O<sub>3</sub> exposure.", "As our study subjects were from one single hospital in China, it should be cautious when generalizing our findings to other regions.", "Short-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was significantly associated with a higher odds of outpatient visits for ADs, which can contribute to considerable excess outpatient visits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
