Algae in water samples from the source water of Feng-Shen waterworks (FSW), Taiwan were cultivated at 30 degrees C with continuous light at an intensity between 2,500 and 3,400 lux. During the cultivating process, water samples were analyzed for nutrients, light absorbance at 665 nm (A665), and 2-MIB concentration. The 2-MIB concentrations within the incubated samples increased to as high as 1,000 ng/L to 2,000 ng/L, although no extra nutrients were added to the raw water. After 2 to 3 days incubation, the intracellular 2-MIB concentration was as high as 70% of the total 2-MIB in the samples. The algae that developed were mainly cyanobateria, and more than 90% belonged to the Genus Oscillatorias. An almost 100% removal of both 2-MIB and geosmin in the raw water was observed after ozonation for 10 minutes at a dosing rate of 0.91 mg/l-min. Chlorine and permanganate were much less effective, both removing only about 11% of the 2-MIB within 60 minutes at oxidant concentration of 10 mg/l. Oxidation of the cultivated samples showed that chlorine and permanganate may damage algae cells causing them to release intracellular 2-MIB. During the 60 minutes of reaction time, the total 2-MIB concentrations (intracellular plus dissolved) varied by no more than 10%, however, the ratios between dissolved and total 2-MIB concentrations increased. Two effects of ozonation on the 2-MIB concentration in the cultivated samples were observed when the algae were young, namely 2-MIB release from damaged cells and 2-MIB oxidization. The rates of 2-MIB release and 2-MIB destruction were similar. However, old algae cells were more easily damaged. As a result, intracellular 2-MIB was released faster, and the soluble 2-MIB was destroyed more quickly by ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan. p5889108@dec4000.cc.ncku.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tung", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00OT1QX5U4", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Permanganate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Permanganate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15237636"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
