Ozonation is an effective technique for the degradation of micropollutants. However, incomplete oxidation can lead to the formation of ecotoxic by-products that require a subsequent post-treatment step. In this study, we analyze the susceptibility of micropollutant ozonation products to enzymatic digestion with laccase from Trametes versicolor to evaluate the potential of enzymatic treatment as a post-ozonation step. The omnipresent micropollutant diclofenac is used as an example, and the enzymatic degradation kinetics of all 14 detected ozonation products are analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS<sup>2</sup>). The analysis shows that most of the ozonation products are responsive to chemo-enzymatic treatment but show considerable variation in enzymatic degradation kinetics and efficiencies. Mechanistic investigation of representative transformation products reveals that the hydroxylated aromatic nature of the ozonation products matches the substrate spectrum, facilitating their rapid recognition as substrates by laccase. However, after initiation by laccase, the subsequent chemical pathway of the enzymatically formed radicals determines the global degradability observed in the enzymatic process. Substrates capable of forming stable molecular oxidation products inhibit complete detoxification by oligomerization. This emphasizes that it is not the enzymatic uptake of the substrates but the channelling of the reaction of the substrate radicals towards the oligomerization of the substrate radicals that is the key step in the further development of an enzymatic treatment step for wastewater applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
