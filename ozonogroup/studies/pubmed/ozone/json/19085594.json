Ozone was generated in situ using Corona discharge method using compressed oxygen stream and depending on the oxygen flux the ozone concentrations ranged from 0.91-4.72 mg/L. The rate of disinfection of all the three microbes followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the microbe count and first order with respect to ozone concentration. The influence of pH and temperature the aqueous systems on the rate of ozone initiated disinfection of the microbe was investigated. The inactivation was faster at lower pH than at basic pH. Molecular ozone is found more effective in disinfection than hydroxyl radicals. Two reported mechanisms for antimicrobial activity of ozone in water systems from the literature are discussed. Based on the experimental findings a probable rate law and mechanism are proposed. Ozonation of natural waters significantly decreased the BOD levels of the control and microbe contaminated waters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Chiltern Hills, Durban, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuma", "ForeName": "Favourite", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Johnson", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jonnalagadda", "ForeName": "Sreekanth B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19085594", "10.1080/10934520802515335", "906806176"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
