The results showed that \u2460 with increasing ozone concentration year by year, the assessment standard of ozone pollution was overtaken by three consecutive years since 2016. However, the rising trend was slowed down since 2017 as a result of the strengthened pollution control during summer. \u2461 The monthly curve of ozone concentration was presented as a reversed \"V\" model with a rising trend accompanying the rising temperature from January to July and a decreasing one during the rest of the year, peaking in July in terms of average monthly ozone concentration. However, this model would turn into an \"M\" in years with high precipitation when the valley witnessed the highest precipitation in a month. \u2462 The ozone pollution increased from the year 2014 to 2018 with a stretch-forward ozone polluted time. Furthermore, the rates of ozone non-attainment increased from 1.9% in 2014 to 14% in 2018. In addition, the time ozone pollution emerged advanced from July to May. \u2463 Based on the GAM model, ozone concentration was non-colinearly related to temperature, air pressure, sunshine duration, and relative humidity. However, the curves of these factors varied considerably, with a positive influence of temperature and sunshine duration and a negative influence of air pressure and relative humidity. The influence of precipitation was mainly witnessed in summers, while no influence of wind was observed. Furthermore, ozone pollution can be easily triggered under the following conditions:temperature>24\u2103, air pressure <962 hPa, sunshine duration>9 h, and a relative humidity 36%-65% with no rain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Tourism, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aerosol Chemistry and Physics, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710061, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geographical Sciences, Shanxi Normal University, Linfen 041004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Gang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Tourism, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Tian-Jie", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Tourism, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aerosol Chemistry and Physics, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jing-Bo", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Aerosol Chemistry and Physics, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jun-Ji", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hanzhong City Ecological Environment Bureau, Hanzhong 724200, China."}], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hu", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608658", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201906067"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
