Using a self-administered questionnaire, 1,113 physicians answered questions regarding their socio-demographic data, and knowledge, attitudes and utilization of CAM.", "About 8% of the participants had attended a continuous medical education or a training activity. Most of them were unfamiliar with reflexology, energy healing, aromatherapy, ozone therapy, homeopathy, or chiropractic care (77.4, 71.3, 71.2, 67.2, 65.7, and 63.9%, respectively). On the other hand, most physicians felt that they could understand and feel comfortable about counseling patients about Ruqyah (spiritual healing), honey and bee products, dietary supplements, massage therapy, relaxation, herbal medicine, and cupping (40.3, 38.3, 34.9, 34.4, 25.8, 22.8, and 21.4%, respectively). More than half (51.7%) of the physicians used CAM for themselves or their family, but only 14.2% referred their patients to CAM practitioners. 85.1% of studied physicians agreed that physicians should have knowledge about CAM therapies commonly used in the region. 82.5% agreed that health authorities should have a role in regulating CAM, and 75.7% agreed that the physicians' knowledge about CAM practices leads to better patient outcome.", "There is a positive attitude regarding the concept of CAM, but there is a reluctance to refer or to initiate discussion with patients regarding CAM practices, which may be attributed to a lack of knowledge."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 S.
