The following rate coefficients (in units of cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) have been obtained: (1.08 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10(-10) and (1.25 \u00b1 0.32) \u00d7 10(-10) for the reactions of OH with iBVE and tBVE, respectively; (2.85 \u00b1 0.62) \u00d7 10(-16) and (5.30 \u00b1 1.07) \u00d7 10(-16) for the ozonolysis of iBVE and tBVE, respectively; and (1.99 \u00b1 0.56) \u00d7 10(-12) and (4.81 \u00b1 1.01) \u00d7 10(-12) for the reactions of NO(3) with iBVE and tBVE, respectively. The rate coefficients for the NO(3) reactions are first-time determinations. The measured rate coefficients are compared with estimates using current structure activity relationship (SAR) methods and the effects of the alkoxy group on the gas-phase reactivity of the alkyl vinyl ethers toward the oxidants are compared and discussed. In addition, estimates of the tropospheric lifetimes of iBVE and tBVE with respect to their reactions with OH, ozone, and NO(3) for typical OH radical, ozone, and NO(3) radical concentrations are made, and their relevance for the environmental fate of compounds is considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bergische Universitaet Wuppertal, Physikalische Chemie/FBC, Gauss Strasse 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany. szhou@chem.utoronto.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shouming", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benter", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22897604", "10.1021/jp305992a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
