Ozone (0.0144 mg/min) was selected as the bactericide to control the bacterial contamination in a white-rot fungal reactor. The control effect on bacteria, enzyme production, pH variation and decolorization of a recalcitrant dye (acid blue 45) in the reactor were studied during continuously operating the reactor. It was found that, the contamination bacteria were controlled at under a number of 1 x 10(5)-1 x 10(6) CFU/mL and the inactivation rate of contaminating bacteria in white-rot fungal reactor was close to 99%. The Phanerochaete chrysosporium continuously produced MnP with the maximum residual activity of 50 U/L and degraded the acid blue 45 with a rate of 40%-80%. At around pH 6, the system still had the capability to continuously produce MnP and degrade the acid blue 45. To keep the growth of white-rot fungi and production of MnP for a long-term operation is a next step point to be solved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, Department of Environment Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. c-zhou04@tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Xiang-Hua", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phanerochaete"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19662871"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
