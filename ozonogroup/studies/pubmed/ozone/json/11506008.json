The reaction of ammonia with SO2 produces submicron aerosols under certain conditions. Experiments have shown the feasibility of combined SO2 and NOx removal from simulated flue gases by the action of these in-situ generated aerosols. The mechanisms for NOx removal include oxidation of NO to NO2 and subsequent absorption of NO2 into the water wall of the wESP. The results have shown that injecting NH3 (NH3/NOx molar ratio 1) resulted in NOx removal of approximately 13% in a simulated combustion flue gas. Injecting 200 ppm ozone (no ammonia) increased NO conversion to 35% by oxidation, but total NOx removal increased to only 17%. Without the formation of ammonium salts aerosols (e.g., without SO2 in the gas), co-injection of ammonia and ozone increased NO conversion to 60% and NOx removal to 40%. However, high NOx removals were measured in simulated flue gas that contained NH3, SO2, and ozone. The total NOx removal efficiency was 79% when the ammonium salts aerosols were formed in the presence of 2400 ppm SO2, 312 ppm O3, and 2,900 ppm NH3. The energy efficiency of collection improved by approximately 250% for SO2 removal and more than 4700% for NOx removal under these conditions. It was determined that the ammonium salts aerosols produced from the reaction of ammonia and sulfur dioxide substantially enhanced total NOx removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Ohio 45221, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tseng", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keener", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khang", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11506008", "10.1021/es001797x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
