We investigated the physiological and biomass responses of an O<sub>3</sub> sensitive hybrid poplar clone ('546') under three O<sub>3</sub> levels (charcoal-filtered ambient air, non-filtered ambient air (NF), and NF plus 40\u00a0ppb) and two watering regimes (well-watered (WW) and reduced watering (RW), i.e. 40% irrigation) for one growing season. Water stress increased chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, protecting leaves from pigment degradation by O<sub>3</sub>. Impairment of photosynthesis by O<sub>3</sub> was also reduced by stomatal closure due to water stress, which preserved light-saturated CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, and the maximum carboxylation efficiency. Water stress increased water use efficiency of the leaves while O<sub>3</sub> decreased it, showing significant interactions. Effects were more evident in older leaves than in younger leaves. Water stress reduced biomass production, but the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> were less in RW than in WW for total biomass per plant. A stomatal O<sub>3</sub> flux-based dose-response relationship was parameterized considering water stress effects, which explained biomass losses much better than a concentration-based approach. The O<sub>3</sub> critical level of Phytotoxic Ozone Dose over a threshold of 7\u00a0nmol O<sub>3</sub>.m<sup>-2</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup> (POD<sub>7</sub>) for a 4% biomass loss in this poplar clone under different water regimes was 4.1\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>. Our results suggest that current O<sub>3</sub> levels in most parts of China threaten poplar growth and that interaction with water availability is a key factor for O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
