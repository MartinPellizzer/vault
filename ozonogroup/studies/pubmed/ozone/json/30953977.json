Experimental results revealed that there was an enhancement of PMT degradation efficiency by 42.1% and the pseudo-first-order rate constant by more than 5.7 times in O<sub>3</sub>/HAC process under low HAC dosage (5\u2009mg\u2009L<sup>-1</sup>) after 3\u2009min in comparison with O<sub>3</sub> alone. The second-order rate constant of PMT with hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) was determined to be (1.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1) \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and 7.80\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> via competition kinetics and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH steady-state hypothesis, respectively. The PMT removal in O<sub>3</sub>/HAC process was highly pH-dependent and the optimum degradation performance was achieved under pH 5.0. In addition, <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and singlet oxygen were identified as the primary reactive oxygen radicals in O<sub>3</sub>/HAC process. Meanwhile, eleven transformation products of PMT were identified and possible degradation mechanisms were proposed. Moreover, a kinetic model based on chemical kinetics and steady-state hypothesis was developed and modified to predict the PMT abatement in O<sub>3</sub>/HAC process. The results demonstrated that the O<sub>3</sub>/HAC process provided a promising alternative for refractory organic pollutants decontamination in water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
