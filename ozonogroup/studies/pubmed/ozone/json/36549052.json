Even though nowadays numerous soil remediation technologies are available, most of them have not been tested at field scale. This study attempts to demonstrate the efficiency of solarization-ozonation techniques for the removal of twelve pesticides at full scale. Initial solarization and ozonation trials were conducted in plots located in a greenhouse using freshly and aged contaminated soils under controlled pilot conditions. The combination of solarization and ozonation treatment was efficient for all the studied pesticides both in freshly and in aged contaminated soils, being the lower degradation values found for the second type. This low removal suggests that the increase of pesticides' adsorption on soil resulting from ageing decreases their availability. Once the essays were carried out at pilot scale, the solarization-ozonation applicability was evaluated in a commercial farm soil. This trial was carried out in a greenhouse whose soil had previously been contaminated with some of the pesticides studied. A significant degradation (53.8%) was observed after 40 days of treatment. Pesticides' main metabolites were identified during the different remediation experiments. In addition, the cost of the combined solarization and ozonation technology was evaluated. Finally, our results suggest that this combination of techniques could be considered a promising technology to degrade pesticides in soil."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
