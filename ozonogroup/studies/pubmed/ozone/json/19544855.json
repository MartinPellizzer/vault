The reaction products observed were identified and quantified using derivatization by O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine (PFBHA) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Limonene rate constants and product mechanisms have been examined previously. Several of these investigations have measured productyields from limonene reactions and those results are compared with the results presented here. Although rate constants and product mechanisms have previously been investigated for alpha-terpineol and geraniol, yields of oxygenated organic reaction products have not been measured. Reactions from the fragrance compounds in this study produced several dicarbonyl reaction products such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 4-oxopentanal which were observed from all three terpenes. Total carbonyl yields ranged from 5.1% for the limonene + O3 reaction to 92% for the geraniol + O3 reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, West Virginia 26505, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forester", "ForeName": "Crystal D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wells", "ForeName": "J Raymond", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21334LVV8W", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-terpineol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L837108USY", "NameOfSubstance": "geraniol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19544855", "10.1021/es803465v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
