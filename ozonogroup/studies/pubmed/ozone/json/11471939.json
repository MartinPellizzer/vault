The saplings were exposed to 1.5-1.6 times the ambient (elevated) ozone and ambient air (as control) over three growing seasons from May 1996 until August 1998. Quantification by modified Folin-Ciocalteau assay showed a 16.2% increase in total phenolics in elevated ozone plants as compared to that in controls and a corresponding 9.9% increase of 10 phenolic compounds quantified by HPLC. Five nonflavonoids and five flavonoids showed 8.4% and 11.4% increases, respectively. The phenolic results indicated slightly higher ozone sensitivity of clone 5 as compared to clone 2. The most ozone-responsive phenolic compounds in clone 2 and clone 5 were (+)-catechin (CT), chlorogenic acid (CGA), 5-p-coumaroylquinic acid (5CQA), 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid (3CQA), myricetin galactopyranoside (MG), quercetin-3-O-glucuronopyranoside (QGR), and quercetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside (QA). Increased phenolic content in ozone-exposed plants was related to impaired growth and accelerated leaf senescence, indicated by enhanced autumn leaf yellowing and lower chlorophyll and Mg content. The change in carbon allocation towards defensive phenolics at the expense of growth was greater in the ozone-sensitive clone as compared to tolerant clone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Turku, Finland. amsale@utu.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loponen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pihlaja", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "7505563", "ISSNLinking": "0098-0331"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Dec;97(4):1280-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16668544"]}, {"Citation": "Planta Med. 1992 Feb;58(1):77-80", "ArticleIdList": ["17226439"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1991 Mar;17(3):505-13", "ArticleIdList": ["24258801"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1994 Jun;20(6):1223-80", "ArticleIdList": ["24242340"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell. 1995 Jul;7(7):1085-1097", "ArticleIdList": ["12242399"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1995;87(3):303-12", "ArticleIdList": ["15091580"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1993 Jul;19(7):1521-52", "ArticleIdList": ["24249181"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1987 Jul;72 (4):510-514", "ArticleIdList": ["28312511"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11471939", "10.1023/a:1010351406931"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
