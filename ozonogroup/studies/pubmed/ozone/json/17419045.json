Some recent policy decisions in Sweden aim to influence waste management in the direction of the waste hierarchy. In 2001 a governmental commission assessed the economic and environmental impacts of introducing a weight-based tax on waste incineration, the purpose of which would be to encourage waste reduction and increase materials recycling and biological treatment. This paper presents the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the waste incineration tax proposal. It was done in the context of a larger research project concerning the development and testing of a framework for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The aim of this paper is to assess the life cycle environmental impacts of the waste incineration tax proposal, and to investigate whether there are any possibilities of more optimal design of such a tax. The proposed design of the waste incineration tax results in increased recycling, but only in small environmental improvements. A more elaborate tax design is suggested, in which the tax level would partly be related to the fossil carbon content of the waste."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Strategies Research - fms, Royal Institute of Technology, Drottning Kristinas v\u00e4g 30 III, SE-100 44, Stockholm, Sweden. annab@infra.kth.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bj\u00f6rklund", "ForeName": "Anna E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finnveden", "ForeName": "G\u00f6ran", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag", "NlmUniqueID": "9884362", "ISSNLinking": "0956-053X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Federal Government"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sweden"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taxes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17419045", "10.1016/j.wasman.2007.02.027", "S0956-053X(07)00079-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
