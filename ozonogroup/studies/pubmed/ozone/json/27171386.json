Empirical investigations have focused on the identification and measurement of oil and gas air pollutants [e.g. volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), methane] and the influence of UOG on local and regional ambient air quality (e.g. tropospheric ozone). While more studies to better characterize spatial and temporal trends in exposure among children and newborns near UOG sites are needed, existing research suggests that exposure to air pollutants emitted during lifecycle operations can potentially lead to adverse respiratory outcomes in this population. Children are known to be at a greater risk from exposure to air pollutants, which can impair lung function and neurodevelopment, or exacerbate existing conditions, such as asthma, because the respiratory system is particularly vulnerable during development in-utero, the postnatal period, and early childhood. In this article, we review the literature relevant to respiratory risks of UOG on infants and children. Existing epidemiology studies document the impact of air pollutant exposure on children in other contexts and suggest impacts near UOG. Research is sparse on long-term health risks associated with frequent acute exposures - especially in children - hence our interpretation of these findings may be conservative. Many data gaps remain, but existing data support precautionary measures to protect the health of infants and children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Webb", "ForeName": "Ellen", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hays", "ForeName": "Jake", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dyrszka", "ForeName": "Larysa", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rodriguez", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "Caroline", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huffling", "ForeName": "Katie", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bushkin-Bedient", "ForeName": "Sheila", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rev Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0425754", "ISSNLinking": "0048-7554"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Natural Gas"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Natural Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27171386", "10.1515/reveh-2014-0070", "/j/reveh.ahead-of-print/reveh-2014-0070/reveh-2014-0070.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
