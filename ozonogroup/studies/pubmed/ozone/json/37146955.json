However, evaluating the effects of modifications to the acyl-ACP desaturase on lipid unsaturation is not currently amenable to high-throughput assays, limiting the scale of redesign efforts to <200 variants. Here, we report a rapid MS assay for profiling the positions of double bonds on membrane lipids produced by Escherichia coli colonies after treatment with ozone gas. By MS measurement of the ozonolysis products of \u03946 and \u03948 isomers of membrane lipids from colonies expressing recombinant Thunbergia alata desaturase, we screened a randomly mutagenized library of the desaturase gene at 5\u00a0s per sample. Two variants with altered regiospecificity were isolated, indicated by an increase in 16:1 \u03948 proportion. We also demonstrated the ability of these desaturase variants to influence the membrane composition and fatty acid distribution of E. coli strains deficient in the native acyl-ACP desaturase gene, fabA. Finally, we used the fabA deficient chassis to concomitantly express a non-native acyl-ACP desaturase and a medium-chain thioesterase from Umbellularia californica, demonstrating production of only saturated free fatty acids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
