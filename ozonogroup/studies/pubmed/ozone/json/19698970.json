The intracellular ATP concentration was not affected at less than 5mgO(3)g(-1) TSS and thereafter decreased rapidly to around 60% when the ozone dose increased to 20mgO(3)g(-1) TSS. Similarly, the efficiency of sludge solubilization initially changed a little and then increased rapidly to around 30% at an ozone dose of 20mgO(3)g(-1) TSS. However, the activities of superoxide dismutase and protease decreased immediately upon exposure to ozone. These findings indicate that ozone firstly destroys the floc, leading to the disruption of the compact aggregates, which does not affect cells viability but induces a decrease in enzyme activities. Ozone then attacks the bacterial cells of the sludge, causing a decrease in cells viability. During ozonation, the content of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the sludge matrix decreased, while the content of these elements in the micro-solids and supernatant gradually increased. Most of the released metals from the sludge matrix were found in the micro-solids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. chulibing@tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Libing", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianlong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Xin-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Sangtian", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xulin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurcik", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Hydrolases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19698970", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.07.047", "S0045-6535(09)00851-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
