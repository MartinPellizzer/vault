The results show that:\u2460 the average ozone concentration in the PRD has increased significantly from 2006 to 2019 (<i>P</i><0.05), with an average growth rate of 0.80 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>. After 2016, the rate of ozone increase has accelerated. \u2461 The average annual ozone concentration in the central PRD increased significantly, while in the peripheral areas of the PRD, this is not obvious. Ozone increases significantly in summer but not in other seasons.\u2462 From 2006 to 2019, the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> in the central PRD decreased remarkably, so the titration effect weakened and resulted in an increase in the ozone concentration. The concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> in the marginal areas of the PRD has little change, so the ozone concentration in these areas has little change. \u2463 With the changes of VOCs and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, the chemical sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> production in the PRD is changing. The VOC-limited regimes are continuously decreasing, and the mixed NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOC-limited regimes and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regimes are increasing. In order to deal with regional ozone pollution, the cooperative control of VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> needs to strengthen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "She-Xia", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia-Ren", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ecological Environment Simulation and Protection, South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510535, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lai-Guo", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Shao-Jia", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33372461", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202005249"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
