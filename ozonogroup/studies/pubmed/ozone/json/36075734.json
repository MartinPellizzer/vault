It describes single bonds and demonstrates the existence of a \"forgotten family\" of charge-shift bonds (CSBs) in which the entire/most of the bond energy arises from the resonance between the covalent and ionic structures of the bond. Many of the CSBs are homonuclear bonds. Hypervalent molecules (e.g., XeF<sub>2</sub>) are CSBs. This Perspective proceeds to describe multiple bonded molecules with an emphasis on C<sub>2</sub> and <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. C<sub>2</sub> has four electron pairs in its valence shell and, hence, 14 covalent structures and 1750 ionic structures. This Perspective outlines an effective methodology of peeling the electronic structure to the minimal and important number of structures: a dominant structure that displays a quadruple bond and two minor structures with \u03c0 + \u03c3 bonds, which stabilize the quadruple bond by resonance. <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is chosen because it is a diradical, which is persistent and life-sustaining. It is shown that the persistence of this diradical is due to the charge-shift bonding of the \u03c0-3-electron bonds. This section ends with a discussion of the roles of \u03c0 vs \u03c3 in the geometric preferences of benzene, acetylene, ethene, and their Si-based analogs. Subsequently, this Perspective discusses bonding in clusters of univalent metal atoms, which possess only parallel spins (<sup>n+1</sup>M<sub>n</sub>), and are nevertheless bonded due to the resonance interactions that stabilize the repulsive elementary structure (all spins are up). The bond energy reaches \u223c40 kcal/mol for a pair of atoms (in <sup>n+1</sup>Cu<sub>n</sub>; n \u223c 10-12). The final subsection discusses singlet excited states in ethene, ozone, and SO<sub>2</sub>. It demonstrates the capability of the breathing-orbital VB method to yield an accurate description of a variety of excited states using merely 10 or few VB structures. Furthermore, the method underscores covalent structures that play a key role in the correct description and bonding of these excited states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7643-9421"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel."}], "LastName": "Shaik", "ForeName": "Sason", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8730-5119"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 9190401, Israel."}], "LastName": "Danovich", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7081-4654"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNRS, Institut de Chimie Physique UMR8000, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, 91405 Orsay, France."}], "LastName": "Hiberty", "ForeName": "Philippe C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36075734", "10.1063/5.0095953"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
