They play a significant role as precursors in the formation of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). The simultaneous removal of NOx and VOCs is crucial in addressing ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution. In terms of investment costs and space requirements, the development of bifunctional catalysts for the simultaneous selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx and catalytic oxidation of VOCs emerges as a viable technology that has garnered considerable attention. This review provides a summary of recent advances in catalysts for the simultaneous removal of NOx and VOCs. It discusses the reaction mechanisms and interactions involved in NH<sub>3</sub>-SCR and VOCs catalytic oxidation, the effects of catalyst acidity and redox properties. The insufficiency of bifunctional catalysts was pointed out, including issues related to catalytic activity, product selectivity, catalyst deactivation, and environmental concerns. Subsequently, potential solutions are presented to enhance catalyst performance, such as optimizing the redox properties and acidity, enhancing resistance to poisoning, substituting environment friendly metals and introducing hydrocarbon selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR) reaction. Finally, some suggestions are given for future research directions in catalyst development are prospected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
