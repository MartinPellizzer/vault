Outcome measures included spirometry, sputum markers of airway inflammation, and plasma club cell protein-16 (CC16), a marker of airway epithelial injury. The effects of ozone exposure on these outcomes were evaluated with mixed-effect linear models. A P value less than 0.01 was chosen a priori to define statistical significance.", "The mean (95% confidence interval) FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC increased from preexposure values by 2.7% (2.0-3.4) and 2.1% (1.3-2.9), respectively, 15 minutes after exposure to filtered air (0 ppb). Exposure to ozone reduced these increases in a concentration-dependent manner. After 120-ppb exposure, FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC decreased by 1.7% (1.1-2.3) and 0.8% (0.3-1.3), respectively. A similar concentration-dependent pattern was still discernible 22 hours after exposure. At 4 hours after exposure, plasma CC16 increased from preexposure levels in an ozone concentration-dependent manner. Sputum neutrophils obtained 22 hours after exposure showed a marginally significant increase in a concentration-dependent manner (P\u2009=\u20090.012), but proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) were not significantly affected.", "Exposure to ozone at near ambient levels induced lung function effects, airway injury, and airway inflammation in older healthy adults.
