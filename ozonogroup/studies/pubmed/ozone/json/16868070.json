After thawing, the cells can proliferate and, when treated with Matrigel, they can differentiate into mature hepatocytes (MHs). In this study, we investigated whether cryopreserved SHs could express cytochromes P450 (P450s), whether P450 expression was induced by appropriate inducers, and whether P450 activities were measurable. 3-Methylcholanthrene (3-MC), phenobarbital (PB), pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN), and ethanol were used as inducers for CYP1A, 2B, 3A, and 2E, respectively. Immunoblot analysis indicated that cryopreserved SHs constitutively expressed CYP1A1/2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A2 as much as 26 days after plating. Significant expression of CYP1A1/2 and 3A2 in the cells treated with Matrigel was induced by 3-MC and PCN, respectively. Although Matrigel did not up-regulate the enzymatic activity of CYP1A, CYP3A and CYP2E activities increased. Induction of CYP1A and CYP3A activities by each inducer was observed in cryopreserved cells treated with Matrigel. Although the expression of CYP2B1 could be detected in subcultured SHs treated with PB, it was not detected in cryopreserved SHs. The activity of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was measured in both subcultured and cryopreserved SHs, although the activities in both were approximately 30% of that of MHs. Profiles of (14)C-testosterone metabolites were examined in cultured MHs and in cryopreserved SHs by high-performance liquid chromatography. Similar peaks for testosterone metabolites in MHs and SHs were observed in the same elution time. These results indicate that, although induction of CYP3A and 2B in cryopreserved SHs is inferior to that in subcultured ones, SHs can maintain the expression and activities of P450s after long-term cryopreservation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Cancer Research Institute, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1, West-17, Chuo-Ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ooe", "ForeName": "Hidekazu", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kon", "ForeName": "Junko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyamoto", "ForeName": "Shigeki", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Yoshiyasu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ninomiya", "ForeName": "Shin-ichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitaka", "ForeName": "Toshihiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Dispos", "NlmUniqueID": "9421550", "ISSNLinking": "0090-9556"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Laminin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteoglycans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "119978-18-6", "NameOfSubstance": "matrigel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1434-54-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Pregnenolone Carbonitrile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56-49-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylcholanthrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Serine Dehydratase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YQE403BP4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenobarbital"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Shape"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cryopreservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Serine Dehydratase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Laminin"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methylcholanthrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenobarbital"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnenolone Carbonitrile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Proteoglycans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16868070", "10.1124/dmd.105.008342", "dmd.105.008342"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
