Aerosol yield differed depending on which OH scavenger was used, with the highest yield noted for CO, followed by cyclohexane and 2-butanol. Number and volume concentrations were quickly increased within the reactor by 15 and 8%, respectively, when NH3 was added after the reaction ceased. The increase in number concentration indicated the formation of new particles resulting from gas-to-particle conversion. Moreover, average particle size increased from 242 to 248 nm. The resulting aerosol growth was attributed to ammonium salts formed by the reaction between organic acids and NH3. When NH3 was added to aerosolized cis-pinonic acid in the environmental reactor, a dramatic increase in both number and volume concentrations of cis-pinonic acid was observed. This provides further evidence that NH3 can interact with gas-phase organic acids forming condensable salts and thereby enhancing SOA formation. Initially present NH3 significantly enhanced aerosol yield in alpha-pinene-ozone reactions, regardless of the presence of water vapor. The role of NH3 on SOA formation in the dry and humid conditions is discussed in terms of a theoretical modeling study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Research and Technology, Bourns College of Engineering, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Na", "ForeName": "Kwangsam", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Switzer", "ForeName": "Cameron", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cocker", "ForeName": "David R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17937287", "10.1021/es061956y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
