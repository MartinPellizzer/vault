Nowadays consumers' increasing interest in microbial safety products with premium appearance, flavor, great nutritional value and extended shelf-life has promoted the development of emerging non-thermal food processing technologies as alternative or substitution to traditional thermal methods. Fish is an important and world-favored food but has a short shelf-life due to its extremely perishable characteristic, and the microbial spoilage and oxidative process happen rapidly just from the moment of capture, making it dependent heavily on post-harvest preservation. The applications of novel non-thermal food processing technologies, including high pressure processing (HPP), ultrasound (US), pulsed electric fields (PEF), pulsed light (PL), cold plasma (CP) and ozone can extend the shelf-life by microbial inactivation and also keep good sensory quality attributes of fish, which is of high interest for the fish industry. This review presents the principles, developments of emerging non-thermal food processing technologies, and also their applications in fish industry, with the main focus on microbial inactivation and sensory quality. The promising results showed great potential to keep microbial safety while maintaining organoleptic attributes of fish products. What's more, the strengths and weaknesses of these technologies are also discussed. The combination of different food processing technologies or with advanced packaging methods can improve antimicrobial efficacy while not significantly affect other quality properties under optimized treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Refrigeration and Computerised Food Technology (FRCFT), School of Biosystems and Food Engineering , University College Dublin, National University of Ireland , Belfield , Dublin 4 , Ireland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Teagasc Food Research Centre , Ashtown , Dublin 15 , Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yi-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Teagasc Food Research Centre , Ashtown , Dublin 15 , Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Alba", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Refrigeration and Computerised Food Technology (FRCFT), School of Biosystems and Food Engineering , University College Dublin, National University of Ireland , Belfield , Dublin 4 , Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Da-Wen", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Teagasc Food Research Centre , Ashtown , Dublin 15 , Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Brijesh", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fishes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Quality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Storage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30580554", "10.1080/10408398.2018.1495613"]}}]}
