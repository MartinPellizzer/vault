Refrigerants can work together to achieve complementary benefits. Combinations of CO<sub>2</sub> and HFOs can strengthen the thermodynamic properties of CO<sub>2</sub> while inhibiting the flammability of HFOs. At present, relatively few studies have been conducted on the CO<sub>2</sub> + 3,3,3-trifluoropropene (R1243zf) mixture. Besides experimental approaches, molecular simulation has grown in importance as a way to determine thermodynamic and transport properties in recent years. In this study, the Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method was used to simulate the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) properties of the CO<sub>2</sub> + R1243zf binary mixture in the temperature range of 273.15 to 313.15 K, in which the three-site rigid TraPPE force field and a fully flexible transferable all-atom force field were selected to describe CO<sub>2</sub> and R1243zf, respectively. By comparing the GEMC simulation results with the experimental data, it was found that the average deviation of pressure is 2.33%, the average deviation of liquid phase molar fraction \u0394<i>x</i> is 0.0099, and the mean deviation of gaseous phase molar fraction \u0394<i>y</i> is 0.0204. The simulation results accord well with the experimental data and the fitting data of the correlation model in the literature, indicating that the molecular models used for CO<sub>2</sub> and R1243zf can reliably predict the VLE properties. Finally, the critical parameters of the mixture at a temperature of 313.15 K were predicted, and the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of pure R1243zf and the mixture at 273.15 K and 3.5 MPa were calculated and analyzed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jingxin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0173-3647"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0041-5233"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Hefei 230088, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Power and Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem B", "NlmUniqueID": "101157530", "ISSNLinking": "1520-5207"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38193806", "10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c04515"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
