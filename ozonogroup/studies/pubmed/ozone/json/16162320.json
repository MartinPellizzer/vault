A near four-year study of ozone concentrations was carried out between February 2000 and October 2003. Diurnal and monthly variations of ozone are studied. The peak concentration levels are obtained between 13:00 and 15:00 GMT and the lowest levels at 4:00 and 5:00 GMT. The highest values together with a slight increase in data variability are found from April to August, when spring and summer maxima are appreciated. The relationship between synoptic-scale atmospheric transport patterns and the maximum ozone concentrations was also examined. Analysis of the 500-hPa synoptic weather patterns revealed that the highest values occur during continental and Atlantic ridges in summer and, to a lesser extent, during troughs in the east-northeast of the Iberian Peninsula in spring. Our approach entailed calculating 3-day isobaric backward air mass trajectories at the observational site sorted on the following main origins: European continent, African continent, Atlantic Ocean and local. The assessment of the results showed the influence of local conditions on the daily maximum ozone concentrations. Moreover, continental air masses provide certain evidence of long-range transport added to the local or regional contribution of the main cities affecting the sampling site. Conversely, Atlantic trajectories show the least contribution to ozone levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Valladolid c/Prado de la Magdalena s/n, Spain. magperez@fa1.uva.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Torre", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16162320", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.12.049", "S0048-9697(04)00867-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
