We analyzed the variations in ozone concentration, total ozone flux, and stomatal and non-stomatal flux. The relationships between stomatal/non-stomatal ozone deposition velocity and the main meteorological factors were investigated. Finally, the yield losses of winter wheat based on the ozone-dose index (AOT40) and ozone flux index (DF<sub>s</sub>06) were calculated. Results showed that average daily ozone concentration (<i>c</i><sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub>) was 32.9 nL\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. The daytime (08:00-18:00) and nighttime total ozone flux (<i>F</i><sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub>) were -7.6 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup> and -3.1 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and the mean diurnal <i>F</i><sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub> was -5.1 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>. The mean daily stomatal ozone flux (<i>F</i><sub>s</sub>) and non-stomatal ozone flux (<i>F</i><sub>ns</sub>) ranged from 0 to -5.1 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup> and from -1.43 to -10.31 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The mean diurnal <i>F</i><sub>s</sub> and <i>F</i><sub>ns</sub> were -1.43 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup> and -3.66 nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>. High solar radiation (SR), high temperature (<i>T</i>), and moderate humidity were used to analyze stomatal ozone deposition; high SR, moderate <i>T</i>, and high humidity were suitable to analyze non-stomatal ozone deposition. The cumulative total ozone flux (DF<sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub>), cumulative stomatal ozone flux (DF<sub>s</sub>), and cumulative non-stomatal ozone flux (DF<sub>ns</sub>) were 31.58, 9.99, and 21.59 mmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> during the entire experimental period, and DF<sub>s</sub> and DF<sub>ns</sub> accounted for 32% and 68% of DF<sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub>. The ranges of yield loss in winter wheat were estimated at 11.58%-20.37% and 20%-23.56% using different assessment models based on the ozone dose index AOT40 and ozone flux index DF<sub>s</sub>06, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jing-Xin", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "You-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Zhong-Fang", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qi-Qing", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965230", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201702122"]}}]}
