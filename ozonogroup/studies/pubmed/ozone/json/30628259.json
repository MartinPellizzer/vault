The results show that:\u2460 A seasonal variation of the ozone concentration in Hong Kong is notable:autumn > spring > winter > summer. Days of ozone exceeding the standard value are concentrated in summer and autumn and rarely occur in winter and spring. \u2461 The annual mean ozone concentration of the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) in Hong Kong increases from 2000 to 2015, with an average growth rate of 0.77 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>. The 90th percentile concentration of the ozone MDA8 also increases, with an average rate of 1.49 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>. \u2462 Higher temperatures are necessary for ozone pollution in Hong Kong. The higher the temperature is, the more ozone pollution likely occurs. \u2463 In most cases, the ozone concentration is negatively correlated with the relative humidity. The higher the relative humidity is, the lower are the ozone and 90th percentile concentrations in Hong Kong. \u2464 When ozone pollution occurs in Hong Kong, prevailing winds tend to shift from northerly or easterly to westerly. In addition, with the increase of the wind speed, the average ozone concentration changes little, but the 90th percentile ozone concentration significantly decreases. \u2465 Precipitation and cloud cover are important factors affecting the ozone concentration. Weather conditions without or with little rain for many consecutive days are necessary for the occurrence of ozone pollution events. However, with the increase of the cloud cover, the average ozone and 90th percentile concentrations continue to decrease. \u2466 In the case of a total solar radiation \u2264 20 MJ\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> or sunshine duration \u2264 10 h, the ozone concentration is positively correlated with the solar radiation and sunshine duration. However, in the case of intense solar radiation (total solar radiation>20 MJ\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> or duration of sunshine>10 h), the ozone concentrations decrease with increasing solar radiation or duration because strong solar radiation often occurs in the background of sunny weather after rain. At the same time, southerly winds from the sea often prevail, making it difficult for ozone pollution to occur in Hong Kong. \u2467 Ozone excess days in Hong Kong are often accompanied by changes of a series of meteorological conditions including less rain on sunny days, stronger radiation, higher boundary layer height, lower relative humidity, smaller wind speeds, and higher temperatures. The end of the pollution process is accompanied by the opposite weather changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "She-Xia", "Initials": "SX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia-Ren", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Ecology and Environmental Protection, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lai-Guo", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Shao-Jia", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628259", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201803151"]}}]}
