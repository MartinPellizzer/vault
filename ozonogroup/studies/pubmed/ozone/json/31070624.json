We demonstrate that ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) with a low-field differential mobility analyzer can be used to probe nano-ion reaction kinetics. We used the developed IM-MS approach to examine the gas phase reactivity of C<sub>60</sub><sup>-</sup> ions with ozone at atmospheric pressure. Experimental results show that ozonation of C<sub>60</sub><sup>-</sup> mainly leads to the formation of C<sub>60</sub>O<sub>n</sub><sup>-</sup>. The controlled reaction time within the ion mobility instrument enables calculation of ozonation reaction rates and assuming oxygen atoms are added sequentially, we find that the reaction rate between C<sub>60</sub><sup>-</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> is near the collision controlled limit. We propose an exponentially decaying reaction rate coefficient expression to describe ozonation leading to the addition of >20 oxygen atoms. At high ozone concentrations, CO or CO<sub>2</sub> loss from C<sub>60</sub>O<sub>n</sub><sup>-</sup> is additionally observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9388-5375"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. hogan108@umn.edu and Laboratory for Physical Chemistry, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 8093 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chenxi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7655-4980"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. hogan108@umn.edu."}], "LastName": "Hogan", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31070624", "10.1039/c9cp01394f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
