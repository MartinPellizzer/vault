The structure, surface morphology and chemical composition of the as-synthesized ZVZ-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> were characterized by BET surface area, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and XPS, respectively. ZVZ-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite exhibited superior catalytic ozonation activity with an improvement of 61.2% on atrazine (ATZ) degradation efficiency in 1.5\u202fmin reaction, more than 12 times of the pseudo-first-order rate constant, and almost 16-fold of the R<sub>ct</sub> value obtained in O<sub>3</sub>/ZVZ-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> process compared to O<sub>3</sub> alone. Meanwhile, the ATZ degradation efficiency was gradually enhanced with increasing ZVZ-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> dosage and initial solution pH in the range from 3.0 to 9.0, and a higher amount of ATZ was degraded when the initial concentration of ATZ rose from 1 to 10\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>. The enhanced catalytic ozonation activity of ZVZ-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is attributed to the synergistic effects among ZVZ, ZnO and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, as well as the improved dispersibility, increased surface area, and intensive electron-transfer ascribed to the electronic and surface properties modification. The radical scavengers experiments demonstrated that O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, OH, and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> were the dominant reactive radical species in the multifunctional processes. Moreover, an empirical kinetic model was proposed to predict ATZ degradation. The results indicated that the ZVZ-g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> composite was a highly efficient, recoverable, and durable catalyst, which would provide a promising alternative in catalytic ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
