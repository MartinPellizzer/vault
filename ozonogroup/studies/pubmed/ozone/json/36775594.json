Then, the volume fraction levels, composition characteristics, reactivity, and source apportionment of atmospheric VOCs were discussed. The results showed that the volume fraction of atmospheric VOCs in Zhengzhou was (37.50\u00b114.30)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> during the sampling period, and the proportion of components was represented by alkanes (33%)>OVOCs (24%)>halogenated hydrocarbons (23%)>aromatic hydrocarbons (8%)>alkenes (7%)>alkynes (4%)>sulfides (1%). The seasonal variation characteristics were winter>autumn>summer>spring, and the monthly average value of VOCs had the highest value in January and the lowest value in May; the spatial variation characteristics were Zhengzhou University (ZD)>Jiancezhan (JCZ)>Jingkaiqu (JKQ)>Gangli Reservoir (GLR). The average\u00b7OH loss rate (<i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>) was 4.24 s<sup>-1</sup>, and the average ozone formation potential (OFP) was 172.27 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>; the top ten species of <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> and OFP at each site and in each season were dominated by alkenes, OVOCs, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The results of positive matrix factorization (PMF) showed that the main sources of VOCs were vehicle emissions (28%), solvent utilization (24%), industrial emissions (24%), and oil and gas volatilization (19%) and plant emissions (5%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ai-Zhi", "Initials": "AZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36775594", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202203117"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
