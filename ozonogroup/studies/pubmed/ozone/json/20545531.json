The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of ozonated plant extracts (herein termed ozonated oil) under the influence of Cyclosporin A (CsA) on osseointegration. A total of 20 dental implants were placed in 20 rabbit tibiae assigned to Group A or B. CsA was injected at an immunosuppressive dose in Groups A and B as a single-dose treatment. At the day of surgery, Group A received a single topical ozonated oil treatment (0.55 mL) around dental implants; Group B, the control group, received no ozonated oil. Animals were sacrificed after 8 weeks. Radiographs were obtained at implant surgery and on the day of sacrifice. Bone quality was compared between the 2 groups. Radiographically, osseointegration was microscopically evaluated using scanning electron and light microscopies. In ozonated Group A specimens, light microscopic examination demonstrated evidence of more organized mature bone compared with Group B. Within the limits of this study, the results suggest that short-term administration of CsA, when administered with topical ozonated oil, may influence bone density and the quality of dental implant osseointegration. Therefore, topically applied ozonated oil may influence bone density and the quality of osseointegration around dental implants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, October 6 University, Egypt. amhadary@netscape.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El Hadary", "ForeName": "Amany A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yassin", "ForeName": "Hala H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mekhemer", "ForeName": "Sameh T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holmes", "ForeName": "Julian C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grootveld", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Implantol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801086", "ISSNLinking": "0160-6972"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83HN0GTJ6D", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclosporine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclosporine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implantation, Endosseous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Implants, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osseointegration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20545531", "10.1563/AAID-JOI-D-09-00098"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
