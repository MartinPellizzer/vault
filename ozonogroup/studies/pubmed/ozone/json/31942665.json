However, specific emission reduction effects of various temporary emission reduction policies are difficult to evaluate. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing in 2014, the Chinese government implemented a number of emergency emission control measures in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area to maintain the air quality in this region. This gave us an opportunity to quantify the effectiveness of the emission reduction measures separately and identify the efficient policy combinations for the reduction of major pollutants. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of specific emission reduction measures on the concentrations of two major air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>) under eight policy scenarios using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Comparing these scenarios, we found that the control policies against the primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> emission achieved the most significant results. Meanwhile, all the emission control measures raised the ozone concentrations in different degrees, which might be partly attributed to the changes of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and the ratio of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs caused by the emission control measures. Our results suggest that, in VOC-sensitive areas like Beijing, emergency control measures focusing on primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> emission could lead to significant PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction and relatively small ozone increase, and should be considered as a priority policy. Joint emission control at the regional scale is also important especially under unfavorable meteorological conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Peifeng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qianru", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Huiming", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Jian", "ForeName": "Xiaohu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9990-1391"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China. xjwang@urban.pku.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xuejun", "Initials": "X"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "41571130010, 41821005, 41630748, 41571484 and 41671492", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Policy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Dec 9;111(49):17373-8", "ArticleIdList": ["25422462"]}, {"Citation": "Huan Jing Ke Xue. 2016 Jan 15;37(1):74-81", "ArticleIdList": ["27078943"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2016 Dec 1;572:289-300", "ArticleIdList": ["27505262"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2018 Jun;237:262-274", "ArticleIdList": ["29494920"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31942665", "10.1007/s10661-019-8056-1", "10.1007/s10661-019-8056-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
