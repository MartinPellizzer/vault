Measurements based on differential absorption lidar (DIAL) were conducted from June to October 2019 in order to investigate the vertical distribution of ozone in Guangdong Province. The vertical and horizontal distributions of ozone in six different cities were systematically examined during the summer and autumn and analyzed the two different ozone characteristics (local pollution and regional transport). TrajStat was used to analyze the ozone transport directions and potential contributions of in the summer and autumn, and the following results were obtained. In the cities of Guangzhou and Jiangmen, the ozone concentrations climbed significantly higher in autumn than in summer, with the ozone concentration reaching a height of 1000\u00a0m in autumn and 600\u00a0m in summer. The diurnal variation of ozone in Yangjiang City in summer was not obvious, whereas in other cities, high levels of ozone were concentrated in the afternoon. The average summer ozone concentration at the Guangzhou site was the highest, approximately 92.57\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, whereas the average at the Dongguan site was the lowest. The average ozone concentration at the Guangzhou site in autumn was also the highest among the six cities, reaching 133.34\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. In terms of local pollution, the high-concentration ozone mainly occurred near the ground. The maximum ozone concentration was approximately 162.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> at about 350\u00a0m, and the ozone was evenly distributed above 1500\u00a0m. The external transport of ozone primarily occurred from 500 to 1100\u00a0m and above 1100\u00a0m. During summer, the southwest airflow trajectory was dominant, whereas northeast airflow predominated in autumn."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
