Model performances in predicting explicit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), organic aerosol (OA), secondary organic carbon (SOC), and other related pollutants in Taizhou, as well as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in multiple cities in this region, were evaluated against observations and model predictions by the CMAQ model coupled with a lumped photochemical mechanism (SAPRC07tic, S07). MCM and S07 exhibited similar performances in predicting gaseous species, while MCM better captured the observed PM<sub>2.5</sub> and inorganic aerosols. Both models underpredicted OA concentrations. When excluding data during biomass burning events, SOC concentrations were underpredicted by the CMAQ-MCM-SOA model (-28.4\u00a0%) and overpredicted by the CMAQ-S07 model (134.4\u00a0%), with better agreement with observations in the trend captured by the CMAQ-MCM-SOA model. Dicarbonyl SOA accounted for a significant fraction of total SOA in the YRD, while organic nitrates originating from aromatics were the most abundant species contributing to the SOA formation from gas-particle partitioning. The oxygen-to\u2011carbon ratio (O/C) for SOA and OA were 0.68-0.75 and 0.20-0.65, respectively, indicating a higher oxidation state in the areas influenced by biogenic emissions. Finally, the phase state of SOA was examined by calculating the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) based on its molecular composition. It was found that semi-solid state characterized SOA in the YRD, which could potentially impact their chemical transformation and lifetimes along with those of their precursors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
