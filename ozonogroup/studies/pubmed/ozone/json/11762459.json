On the other hand, since the 1990s, a new generation of chemical oxidation techniques has been introduced in water treatment. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are based on a combination of UV/H202, UV/O3 or H2O2/O3. The combinations result in the generation of OH-radicals, which subsequently attack the organic pollutants. In this work, the treatment of a gas stream (240 L/h) loaded with 20-40 ppmv trichloroethylene (TCE) is presented. Therefore, a combination of an absorption process in a bubble column with a liquid H2O2/O3 initiated oxidation, was investigated. Removal efficiencies, depending on the dosed H2O2 and O3, up to 94% were found. The production of chloride ions was investigated: the Cl-atoms from the removed TCE could be found back as chloride ions. Next to the experimental work, attention was paid to the mechanisms taking place in the proposed concept. Here, a simulation model was developed, considering gas/liquid mass transfer of TCE and ozone, axial liquid dispersion, advective gas and liquid transport and about 29 chemica reaction steps. The modelling allowed a better understanding of the technique and gives insight in its possibilities and limitations. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed technique shows interesting perspectives: it is able to transform chlorine in chlorinated solvents into chloride ions effectively at ambient temperature conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, G-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dewulf", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Langenhove", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Smedt", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geuens", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "290YE8AR51", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11762459"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
