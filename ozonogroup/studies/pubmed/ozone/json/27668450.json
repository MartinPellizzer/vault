Using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) to monitor squalene, the reactive uptake coefficients were determined to be (4.3 \u00b1 2.2) \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> and (4.0 \u00b1 2.2) \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> for ozone mixing ratios (MR<sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub>) of 50 and 25 ppb, respectively, on squalene films deposited on glass surfaces. At an MR<sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub> of 25 ppb, the lifetime for oxidation was the same as that in an indoor office with an MR<sub>O<sub>3</sub></sub> between 22 and 32 ppb, suggesting that O<sub>3</sub> was the dominant oxidant in this indoor setting. While the heterogeneous kinetics of squalene and O<sub>3</sub> were independent of relative humidity (RH), the RH significantly affected the reaction products. Under dry conditions (<5% RH), in addition to several products between m/z 300 and 350, the major condensed-phase end products were levulinic acid (LLA) and succinic acid (SCA). Under humid conditions (50% RH), the major end products were 4-oxopentanal, 4-oxobutanoic acid, and LLA. The molar yields of LLA and SCA were quantified as 230 \u00b1 43% and 110 \u00b1 31%, respectively, under dry conditions and 91 \u00b1 15% and <5%, respectively, at 50% RH. Moreover, high-molecular weight (molecular weight of >450 Da) products were observed under dry conditions with indications that LLA was involved in their formation. The mechanism of squalene oxidation is discussed in light of these observations, with indications of an important role played by Criegee intermediates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shouming", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "LastName": "Forbes", "ForeName": "Matthew W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto , 80 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7QWM220FJH", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Squalene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27668450", "10.1021/acs.est.6b03270"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
