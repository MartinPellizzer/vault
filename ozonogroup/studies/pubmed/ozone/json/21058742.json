However, a large amount is still currently used due to Critical Use Exemptions. As strategies for reducing the postfumigation emissions of MeBr from soil, Ca(OH)(2), K(2)CO(3), and NH(3) were assessed as means of promoting MeBr degradation. Ammonia aqueous solution (NH(4)OH) was the most effective, because MeBr can be degraded by both hydrolysis and ammonolysis. At 20 \u00b0C, the half-lives (t(1/2)) of MeBr were 18.0, 2.5, and 1.3 h in 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 M NH(4)OH, respectively. In 1.0 M NH(4)OH, increasing the solution temperature to 40 \u00b0C reduced the half-life of MeBr to 0.23 h. Ammonia amendment to moist soil also promoted MeBr transformation, and the MeBr degradation rate increased with increasing soil temperature. NH(4)OH (30%, 16 M) very effectively reacted with MeBr that was contained under plastic film. Under Hytibar (a virtually impermeable film, VIF), over 99.5% of the MeBr could be destroyed by 30% NH(4)OH in 8 h at 20 \u00b0C. On the basis of these results, good management practices (i.e., VIF plus NH(4)OH) could be developed for continued use of MeBr as a soil fumigant under Critical Use Exemptions, without significant emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA-ARS, Salinity Laboratory, 450 West Big Springs Road, Riverside, California 92507, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xuan", "ForeName": "Richeng", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashworth", "ForeName": "Daniel J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Lifang", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Haizhen", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "Scott R", "Initials": "SR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5138Q19F1X", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BQN1B9B9HA", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium carbonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PF5DZW74VN", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21058742", "10.1021/es1022027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
