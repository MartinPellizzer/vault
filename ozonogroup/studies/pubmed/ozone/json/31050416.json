To encourage their synergisms, we designed a Ni-induced C-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-framework (<sub>Ni</sub>CAF) and reinforced it with a Cu-Co bimetal to create an efficient catalyst (CuCo/<sub>Ni</sub>CAF) with a core-multishell structure. The partial graphitization of carbon adjacent to Ni crystals formed a strong out-shell on the catalyst surface. The rate constant for total organic carbon removal of CuCo/<sub>Ni</sub>CAF (0.172 \u00b1 0.018 min<sup>-1</sup>) was 67% and 310% higher than that of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-supported catalysts and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> alone, respectively. The metals on CuCo/<sub>Ni</sub>CAF contributed to surface-mediated reactions during catalytic ozonation, while the embedded carbon enhanced reactions within the solid-liquid boundary layer and in the bulk solution. Moreover, carbon embedment provided a 76% increase in \u00b7OH-production efficiency and an 86% increase in organic-adsorption capacity compared to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-supported catalysts. During the long-term treatment of coal-gasification wastewater (\u223c5 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>), the pilot-scale demonstration of CuCo/<sub>Ni</sub>CAF-catalyzed ozonation revealed a 120% increase in ozone-utilization efficiency (\u0394COD/\u0394O<sub>3</sub> = 2.12) compared to that of pure ozonation (0.96). These findings highlight catalysts supported on <sub>Ni</sub>CAF as a facile and efficient approach to achieve both high catalytic activity and excellent structural stability, demonstrating that they are highly viable for practical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , P.
