In this study, the spatial variations of dibromomethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl<sub>2</sub>), dibromochloromethane (CHBr<sub>2</sub>Cl) and bromoform (CHBr<sub>3</sub>) in the seawater and overlying atmosphere were measured in the Yellow Sea (YS) and the East China Sea (ECS) in winter. The air-sea fluxes of CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, CHBrCl<sub>2</sub>, CHBr<sub>2</sub>Cl and CHBr<sub>3</sub> ranged from -11.46 to 25.33, -4.68 to 7.91, -8.60 to 4.08 and -88.57 to 8.84\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of halocarbons production, we measured bromoperoxidase (BrPO) activity (39.18-186.74 \u03bcU\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) in the YS and ECS for the first time using an aminophenyl fluorescein (APF) method and performed in-situ incubation experiments in BrPO-treated seawater. The production rates of CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, CHBrCl<sub>2</sub>, CHBr<sub>2</sub>Cl and CHBr<sub>3</sub> ranged from 14.21 to 94.74, 0.00 to 19.74, 0.00 to 30.62 and 6.18-72.75\u00a0pmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in BrPO-treated seawater. There were significantly higher production rates in coastal waters compared with the open sea (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) because of higher DOC levels near the coast. Moreover, the production rates of halocarbons increased with BrPO activity and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. The results showed that enzyme-mediated reaction was an important source for the production of halocarbons in seawater. The present research is of great significance for understanding the production mechanisms of halocarbons in seawater and global oceanic halocarbons emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
