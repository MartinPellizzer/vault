This observation raised the possibility that pulmonary damage from other oxidant substances might be greater in a hyperthyroid state. To address this hypothesis, pulmonary responses to crystalline silica, a particulate with oxidant properties, were evaluated in normal or hyperthyroid adult male rats. To induce a hyperthyroid condition, time-release pellets containing thyroxine were implanted subcutaneously; control rats received placebo pellets. After 7 days, the animals were exposed to saline or silica (0.1mg/100g BW or 1.0mg/100g BW) by intratracheal instillation. Following silica treatment, there was a dose-related increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) albumin levels and neutrophil numbers. However, the effects of silica were similar in both normal and hyperthyroid rats. These findings were confirmed and contrasted with those regarding ozone (1ppm, 4h inhalation) in a subsequent experiment. The results indicated that, although exposure to either ozone or silica resulted in increases in BAL albumin levels and neutrophil numbers, only responses to ozone were enhanced in hyperthyroid rats. These findings suggest that specificity exists in regards to the modulation of oxidant-induced lung damage and inflammation by thyroid hormones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, M/S 2015, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huffman", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beighley", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frazer", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKinney", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Porter", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q51BO43MG4", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Susceptibility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperthyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intubation, Intratracheal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroxine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16797819", "10.1016/j.tox.2006.05.008", "S0300-483X(06)00286-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
