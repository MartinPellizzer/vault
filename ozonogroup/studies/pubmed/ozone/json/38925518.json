Consequently, numerous studies have attempted to remove TMAH using various treatment methods, including advanced oxidation processes such as ozone, UV, or Fenton oxidation. However, prior research has indicated a low kinetic rate of TMAH removal. In this context, we proposed an alternative to TMAH degradation by combining a cold plasma (CP) process with periodate oxidation. As for the kinetics of TMAH removal, the kinetic constant was improved by 5 times (0.1661 and 0.0301 for 40.56 and 2.2\u00a0W, respectively) as the electric power of a CP system increased from 2.2 to 40.56\u00a0W. The kinetic constant of a 40.56\u00a0W CP system further increased by 54 times (1.6250) than a 2\u00a0W CP system when 4\u00a0mM periodate was used simultaneously. As a result, the integrated CP/periodate system represented 2 times higher TMAH removal efficiency (29.5%) than a 2\u00a0W CP system (14.4%). This excellent TMAH degradation capability of the integrated CP/periodate system became pronounced at pH 10 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Overall, the integrated CP/periodate system is expected to be a viable management option for effectively controlling hazardous TMAH chemicals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
