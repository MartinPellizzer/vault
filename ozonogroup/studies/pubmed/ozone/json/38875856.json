Especially, NPs have smaller sizes and higher penetrability, and therefore can penetrate the human barrier more easily and may pose potentially higher risks than MPs. Currently, most reviews have overlooked the differences between MPs and NPs and conflated them in the discussions. This review compared the differences in physicochemical properties and environmental behaviors of MPs and NPs. Commonly used techniques for removing MPs and NPs currently employed by wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants were summarized, and their weaknesses were analyzed. We further comprehensively reviewed the latest technological advances (e.g., emerging coagulants, new filters, novel membrane materials, photocatalysis, Fenton, ozone, and persulfate oxidation) for the separation and degradation of MPs and NPs. Microplastics are more easily removed than NPs through separation processes, while NPs are more easily degraded than MPs through advanced oxidation processes. The operational parameters, efficiency, and potential governing mechanisms of various technologies as well as their advantages and disadvantages were also analyzed in detail. Appropriate technology should be selected based on environmental conditions and plastic size and type. Finally, current challenges and prospects in the detection, toxicity assessment, and removal of MPs and NPs were proposed. This review intends to clarify the differences between MPs and NPs and provide guidance for removing MPs and NPs from urban water systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
