We have considered the variability of the stratospheric polar vortex, whose behaviour influences stratospheric ozone loss and will affect ozone recovery. In particular, we analyse the dynamical control of high latitude ozone in a model version which includes an assimilation of the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), demonstrating the stability of the linear relation between vortex strength and high latitude ozone. We discuss the effect of interactive model ozone on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) area/volume and winter-spring stratospheric ozone loss in the northern hemisphere. In general we find larger polar ozone losses calculated in those model integrations in which modelled ozone is used interactively in the radiation scheme, even though we underestimate the slope of the ozone loss per PSC volume relation derived from observations. We have also looked at the influence of changing stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange on the tropospheric oxidizing capacity and, in particular, have considered the variability of tropospheric composition under different climate regimes (El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a, etc.). Focusing on the UT/LS, we show the response of ozone to El Ni\u00f1o in two different model set-ups (tropospheric/ stratospheric). In the stratospheric model set-up we find a distinct signal in the lower tropical stratosphere, which shows an anti-correlation between the Ni\u00f1o 3 index and the ozone column amount. In contrast ozone generally increases in the upper troposphere of the tropospheric model set-up after an El Ni\u00f1o. Understanding future trends in stratospheric ozone and tropospheric oxidizing capacity requires an understanding of natural variability, which we explore here."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, NCAS/ACMSU, University of Cambridge, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pyle", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braesicke", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Faraday Discuss", "NlmUniqueID": "9212301", "ISSNLinking": "1359-6640"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16161776", "10.1039/b417947c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
