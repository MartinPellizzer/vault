Subjects were selected from a pool of 75 normal healthy college-aged males who had been previously exposed to 0.35 ppm O3 for 1 h at an exercising VE of 60 L/min. The selection criterion used was the observed decrement in FEV1 after the O3 exposure: O3-sensitive, FEV1 decrement greater than 24%; O3-nonsensitive, FEV1 decrement less than 11%. Each subject was exposed to filtered air and to 0.20 and 0.35 ppm O3 for 80 min while exercising at a VE of 50 L/min. These experimental protocols were divided into two 40-min sessions separated by a period of 4 to 10 min. PGF2 alpha, FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 were evaluated before, during, and after each protocol. SGaw and Vtg were measured before and after each protocol. Plasma PGF2 alpha was significantly increased in the O3-sensitive group during and after the 0.35-ppm O3 exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Education, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giri", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siefkin", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 07013-14", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B7IN85G1HY", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprost"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprost"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2751167", "10.1164/ajrccm/140.1.211"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
