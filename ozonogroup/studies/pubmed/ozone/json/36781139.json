To comprehensively assess and quantify the association of air pollution exposure with HF incidence and mortality, we performed separate meta-analyses according to pollutant types [PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)], and exposure duration (short- and long-term). We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for relevant articles with publication dates up to July 12, 2022, identifying 35 eligible studies. Random-effects models were used to summarize the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). For long-term exposure, the growing risk of HF was significantly associated with each 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (OR = 1.196, 95 % CI: 1.079-1.326; I<sup>2</sup> = 76.8 %), PM<sub>10</sub> (1.190, 1.045-1.356; I<sup>2</sup> = 76.2 %), and NO<sub>2</sub> (1.072, 1.028-1.118; I<sup>2</sup> = 78.3 %). For short-term exposure, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> (per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment) increased the risk of HF, with estimated ORs of 1.019 (1.008-1.030; I<sup>2</sup> = 39.9 %), 1.012 (1.007-1.017; I<sup>2</sup> = 28.3 %), 1.016 (1.005-1.026; I<sup>2</sup> = 53.7 %), and 1.006 (1.002-1.010; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0 %), respectively. No significant effects of SO<sub>2</sub> and CO exposure on the risk of HF were observed. In summary, our study powerfully highlights the deleterious impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure (either short- or long-term) on HF risk.
