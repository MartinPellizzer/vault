Factors studied were oxidation time, bromide, pH, bicarbonate alkalinity, and ozone dosages. The haloacetic acids detected were dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), and dibromoacetic acid (DBAA) when bromide existed. The catalytic ozonation caused a reduction of HAA5FP of the non-bromide containing water for 9.5% - 18.3% compared to that of ozonation in 5-20 minutes. Incremental addition of bromide led to a much lower HAA5FP after catalytic ozonation than that after ozonation. HAA5FP of the water at neutral pH was higher than that at acidic and basic conditions. Catalytic ozonation showed a most advantageous potential in controlling HAA5FP over ozonation at neutral pH. The HAA5FP decreased as bicarbonate concentration increased, and the disparity between ozonation and catalytic ozonation was also reduced. The HAA5FP after catalytic ozonation was 11.2% to 28.0% lower than that after ozonation while the ratio of O3/TOC ranging from 0.45 to 1.43. The effect of catalytic ozonation on HAA5FP of the water is closely related to its enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals in catalytic process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jin-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-Lin", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Su-Fang", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UA751211N", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17111615"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
