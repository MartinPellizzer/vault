The synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The removal efficiency was compared with different catalyst dosage, pH condition, and initial DBP concentration for the two catalysts. The results showed that the introduction of Ag<sub>0.1</sub>Ni<sub>0.95</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> enhanced the ozone decomposition and the utilization efficiency of ozone from 32.2% (ozone alone) to 56.5% and improved the degradation efficiency of DBP significantly. The two catalysts both presented good recycling performance. Furthermore, the scavenger test displayed DBP degradation by catalytic ozonation dominated by OH in this study. These insights into the catalytic ozonation mechanism on Ag<sub>0.1</sub>Ni<sub>0.95</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> will advance their practical application to the catalytic degradation of organic pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jiashun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peifang", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Junyu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China United Engineering Corporation Limited, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yujie", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Teng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2286E5R2KE", "NameOfSubstance": "Dibutyl Phthalate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dibutyl Phthalate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32423314", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1770338"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
