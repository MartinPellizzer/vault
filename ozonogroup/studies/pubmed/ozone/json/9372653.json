In the presence of hydroxyl radical, salicylate is hydroxylated to form 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA). There is no evidence of enzymatic formation of 2,3-DHBA. We hypothesized that salicylate hydroxylation might be used as a biomarker indicating human exposure to ozone. Healthy, nonsmoking volunteers, 18 to 34 yr of age, were given acetylsalicylic acid (975 mg) or placebo orally 0.5 h before an exposure. Subjects were exposed to ozone (0.12 or 0.4 ppm) or filtered air in an environmental chamber for 2 h, while performing intermittent exercise. Results indicate significant decrements in FVC, FEV1.0, forced expiratory flows at 50% and 75% of FVC, and peak expiratory flow rate, and an increase in airway resistance, after exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone in comparison with air control (p < 0.05). Exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone also resulted in increased symptom numbers and severity (p < 0.05). When subjects were exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone, changes of pulmonary function and symptoms reported were minimal. Plasma concentration of 2,3-DHBA was significantly increased after exposure to 0.12 and 0.4 ppm ozone in comparison with air control (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between ozone-induced changes of pulmonary function and normalized salicylate hydroxylation (p < 0.05). The results indicate that exposure to ozone can initiate in vivo production of hydroxyl radical, a potent reactive agent. Salicylate hydroxylation may then serve as a sensitive dosimetric biomarker for ozone exposure, even at subclinical ozone exposure levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Health Effects Research Section, Environmental Health Directorate, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leech", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urch", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silverman", "ForeName": "F S", "Initials": "FS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70D5FBB392", "NameOfSubstance": "2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R16CO5Y76E", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aspirin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstrictor Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Flow Rates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9372653", "10.1164/ajrccm.156.5.9610105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
