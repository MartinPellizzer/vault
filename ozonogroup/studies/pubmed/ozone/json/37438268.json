The model was compared with three machine learning methods that are commonly used in air quality prediction, including support vector machine, recurrent neural network, and random forest methods, to verify its effectiveness and feasibility. Finally, the performance of the prediction model was analyzed under different meteorological conditions. The results showed that the variation in O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Nanjing had significant seasonal differences and was affected by a combination of its pre-concentration, meteorological factors, and other air pollutant concentrations. The LightGBM model predicted the ground-level O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the Nanjing area more precisely to a large extent (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.92), and the model outperformed other models in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, the model showed a significantly higher prediction accuracy and stability than that of other models under a high-temperature condition that was more likely prone to ozone pollution. The LightGBM model was characterized by its high prediction accuracy, good stability, satisfactory generalization ability, and short operation time, which broaden its application prospect in O<sub>3</sub> concentration prediction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jia-Ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jun-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yue-Zheng", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Weather Modification Office of Qinghai Province, Xining 810000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hohhot Meteorological Bureau, Hohhot 010020, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun-Xiu", "Initials": "JX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438268", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202208095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
