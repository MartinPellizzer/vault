Acrolein, at first a widely distributed environmental pollutant, is currently known as a compound capable of being generated as a result of metabolic reactions within biological systems, highly toxic and the most electrophilic of the alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes formed during lipoperoxidation. In the present study: 1. The separation of acrolein and malondialdehyde was achieved at alkaline pH with the use of high voltage capillary electrophoresis in uncoated fused-silica capillaries. 2. It was demonstrated how the oxidation of fatty acids (arachidonic/linoleic) with ozone generates, in dose-dependent form, acrolein as one of the by-products of the lipoperoxidation process. The oxidation of open human erythrocyte membranes with ozone also generated acrolein. 3. After aldolic condensation, aldol-acrolein derivative has a positive reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and shows a maximum absorption at 498 nm. This novel characteristic is used in its identification after the separation of the by-products. 4. It is possible to suggest that in the classic reaction of the denominated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), when used as an indicator of the degree of peroxidation in biological systems, a portion of acrolein could be present but dwarfed by the TBA-MDA adduct."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Specialties Hospital, Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medina-Navarro", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mercado-Pichardo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez-P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hicks", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbiturates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7864XYD3JJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrolein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M1YZW5SS7C", "NameOfSubstance": "thiobarbituric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acrolein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbiturates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10602392", "10.1191/096032799678839527"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
