Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is implicated as a central regulator in immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperresponsiveness, and fibrosis. The importance of IL-13 in allergic disorders in humans is supported by consistent associations between tissue IL-13 levels and genetic variants in the IL-13 gene and asthma and related traits. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-13 are associated with allergic phenotypes in several ethnically diverse populations. Glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory medications often used as maintenance therapy in acute and chronic asthma; however, some patients with severe asthma are steroid resistant. IL-13 remains elevated in glucocorticoid insensitive asthma but not in glucocorticoid sensitive asthma. Thus targeting IL-13 and its associated receptors may be a therapeutic approach to the treatment of asthma and/or allergy. This review focuses on the role of IL-13 on airway hyperresponsiveness and corticosteroids resistant asthma both preclinically and clinically."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Discovery Medicine"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Creighton University School of Medicine, 601N, 30th St., Omaha, Nebraska 68131, USA. roberttownley@creighton.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Townley", "ForeName": "Robert G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sapkota", "ForeName": "Muna", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sapkota", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Discov Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101250006", "ISSNLinking": "1539-6509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-13"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Interleukin-13"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "genetics", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-13"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Interleukin-13"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22204768"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
