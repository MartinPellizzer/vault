The processes of formation, diffusion, transformation, and transport of O<sub>3</sub> in the atmosphere are highly affected by meteorological conditions such as solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, and wind. Chemical transport models (CTMs) are widely used in simulating O<sub>3</sub> pollution with two main inputs of the meteorological condition and emission inventory. Meteorological inputs play a crucial role in the model simulation accuracy especially in areas where emission has been well constrained such as the United States (U.S.). However, most O<sub>3</sub> simulations today still use only one set of meteorological input, which leaves room for model performance improvement by using ensemble meteorological conditions. In this study, O<sub>3</sub> over the Southeast U.S. was simulated for one week in the summer of each year from 2016 to 2018 by using ensemble meteorological inputs offered by Short Range Ensemble Forecast products. The predictions were conducted through the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry. The calculated ensemble prediction results got at least 66.7% improvement in agreement with O<sub>3</sub> observations compared with single runs in the three selected cities (Miami, Atlanta, and Baton Rouge) from 2016 to 2018. This study emphasized the accuracy and provided a new idea of using ensemble meteorological inputs to improve O<sub>3</sub> prediction than using traditional single meteorology by CTMs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
