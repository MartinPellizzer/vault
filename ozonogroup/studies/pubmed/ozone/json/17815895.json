The observed O(3) column varied between about 325 and 400 Dobson units, and the lower values were observed when the center of the Arctic polar vortex was closest to Thule. This gradient probably indicates that O(3) levels decrease due to dynamical processes near the center of the Arctic vortex and should be considered in attempts to derive trends in O(3) levels. The observed NO(2) levels were also lowest in the center of the Arctic vortex and were sometimes as low as 5 x 10(14) molecules per square centimeter, which is even less than comparable values measured during Antarctic spring, suggesting that significant heterogeneous photochemistry takes place during the Arctic winter as it does in the Antarctic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mount", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanders", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jakoubek", "ForeName": "R O", "Initials": "RO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmeltekopf", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17815895", "10.1126/science.242.4878.555", "242/4878/555"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
