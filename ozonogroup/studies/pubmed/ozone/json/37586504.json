However, limited research has been conducted on the coastal urban agglomerations with increasingly serious O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Therefore, in order to better understand in situ photochemistry, comprehensive field observations of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, coupled with the model simulation, were conducted in autumn of 2019 at six sites in an urban agglomeration along the coastline of southeastern China. Results indicated that O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the southern part of the urban agglomeration was more severe than that in the northern part, due to higher levels of O<sub>3</sub> precursors and stronger atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) in the southern regions. Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO dominated the total OH reactivity, and the site-average daytime Ox (O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>) increments correlated well (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.94) with the total OH reactivity of CO and VOCs at these sites except for Quanzhou, where industrial emissions (35.1\u00a0%) and solvent usages (33.7\u00a0%) dominated the VOC sources. However, vehicle exhausts (31.1\u00a0%) were the most predominant contributors to the VOC sources at other sites. The results of model simulations showed that net O<sub>3</sub> formation rates were larger at the southern sites. Furthermore, O<sub>3</sub> production was mainly controlled by VOCs at most sites, but co-limited by VOCs and NOx at Quanzhou. The most significant VOC groups contributing to O<sub>3</sub> formation were aromatics and alkenes, with m/p-xylene, toluene, propene, and ethene being the main contributors at these sites. This study offers a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and formation of photochemical pollutions on the scale of the urban areas, indicating the critical need to reduce VOC emissions as a means of mitigating their photochemical effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
