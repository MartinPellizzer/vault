This study uses source-apportionment photochemical air quality modeling to estimate the health burden (expressed as incidence) of an array of PM<sub>2.5</sub>- and ozone-related adverse health impacts, including premature death, attributable to 17 mobile source sectors in the US in 2011 and 2025. Mobile sector-attributable air pollution contributes a substantial fraction of the overall pollution-related mortality burden in the U.S., accounting for about 20% of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone-attributable deaths in 2011 (between 21 000 and 55 000 deaths, depending on the study used to derive the effect estimate). This value falls to about 13% (between 13 000 and 37 000 deaths) by 2025 due to regulatory and voluntary programs reducing emissions from mobile sources. Similar trends across all morbidity health impacts can also be observed. Emissions from on-road sources are the largest contributor to premature deaths; this is true for both 2011 (between 12 000 and 31 000 deaths) and 2025 (between 6700 and 18 000 deaths). Non-road construction engines, C3 marine engines and emissions from rail also contribute to large portions of premature deaths. Across the 17 mobile sectors modeled, the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-attributable mortality and morbidity burden falls between 2011 and 2025 for 12 sectors and increases for 5. Ozone-attributable mortality and morbidity burden increases between 2011 and 2025 for 10 sectors and falls for 7. These results extend the literature beyond generally aggregated mobile sector health burden toward a representation of highly-resolved source characterization of both current and future health burden. The quantified future mobile source health burden is a novel feature of this analysis and could prove useful for decisionmakers and affected stakeholders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, Air 4-1 94105, San Francisco, CA, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Davidson", "ForeName": "Kenneth", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Fann", "ForeName": "Neal", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Zawacki", "ForeName": "Margaret", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Fulcher", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "Kirk R", "Initials": "KR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101295599", "ISSNLinking": "1748-9326"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "U.S. EPA 2009.
