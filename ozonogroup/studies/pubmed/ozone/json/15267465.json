The nature and energies of these states may hold the key to the anomalous isotopic distribution of ozone in the atmosphere. Even though the same potential energy surface of Babikov et al. was used in both calculations, the number of bound van der Waals states reported below dissociation differed significantly. In order to resolve the issue we present here the results of an independent computation of all the bound vibrational states of (16)O(16)O(16)O and (16)O(16)O(18)O up to dissociation. Our methods differ from both earlier calculations since we use hyperspherical coordinates and a direct product discrete variable representation of the Hamiltonian. The results of present work support the existence of several van der Waals states for J=0 on this potential energy surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and James Franck Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hee-Seung", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Light", "ForeName": "John C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15267465", "10.1063/1.1691403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
