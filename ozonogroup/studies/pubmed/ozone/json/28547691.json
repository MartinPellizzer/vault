To test this idea, we traced the course of C through the soil microbial community using soils from the free-air CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment site in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. We added either <sup>13</sup>C-labeled cellobiose or <sup>13</sup>C-labeled N-acetylglucosamine to soils collected beneath ecologically distinct temperate trees exposed for 3\u00a0years to factorial CO<sub>2</sub> (ambient and 200\u00a0\u00b5l l<sup>-1</sup> above ambient) and O<sub>3</sub> (ambient and 20\u00a0\u00b5l l<sup>-1</sup> above ambient) treatments. For both labeled substrates, recovery of <sup>13</sup>C in microbial respiration increased beneath plants grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> by 29% compared to ambient; elevated O<sub>3</sub> eliminated this effect. Production of <sup>13</sup>C-CO<sub>2</sub> from soils beneath aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and aspen-birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) was greater than that beneath aspen-maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). Phospholipid fatty acid analyses (<sup>13</sup>C-PLFAs) indicated that the microbial community beneath plants exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> metabolized more <sup>13</sup>C-cellobiose, compared to the microbial community beneath plants exposed to the ambient condition. Recovery of <sup>13</sup>C in PLFAs was an order of magnitude greater for N-acetylglucosamine-amended soil compared to cellobiose-amended soil, indicating that substrate type influenced microbial metabolism and soil C cycling. We found that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increased fungal activity and microbial metabolism of cellobiose, and that microbial processes under early-successional aspen and birch species were more strongly affected by CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment than those under late-successional maple."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, 430\u00a0E.
