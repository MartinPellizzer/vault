One aspect is the question of whether green spaces can reduce air pollutant concentrations. However, previous studies on this issue have reported mixed results. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>\u00a0and O<sub>3\u00a0</sub>in Fujian Province, Southeast China in 2015. In order to reduce uncertainties in the conclusions drawn,\u00a0the effects landscape metrics describing green spaces have on air pollutants have been analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis at six different spatial scales for the four seasons, considering the influence of meteorological conditions. The results show that PM<sub>2.5</sub>\u00a0and O<sub>3\u00a0</sub>are major pollutants whose relative importance varies with the seasons. Significant differences in pollutant concentrations were observed in suburban and urban areas, highlighting the importance of ensuring a reasonable spatial distribution of monitoring stations. Moreover, significant correlations between air pollutants and green space landscape patterns during the four seasons were found,\u00a0revealing increased air pollutant concentrations with increasing landscape fragmentation and reduced connectivity and aggregation. This probably indicates that\u00a0interconnected green spaces have the potential to improve air quality. Utilizing\u00a0green space function regulations can alleviate NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0and PM<sub>2.5\u00a0</sub>pollution effectively, but it is still difficult to reduce O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0concentrations because green spaces are likely to not only serve as sinks for O<sub>3,</sub>\u00a0but can also promote O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Urban Environment and Health, Fujian Key Laboratory of Watershed Ecology, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Longyan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiamen Institute of Environmental Science, Xiamen, CN, China."}], "LastName": "Zhuang", "ForeName": "Mazhan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Urban Environment and Health, Fujian Key Laboratory of Watershed Ecology, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parks, Recreational"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32013546", "10.1080/09603123.2020.1720620"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
