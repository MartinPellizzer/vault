Therefore, the effect of a microbubble on gas-liquid mass transfer and wastewater treatment process was investigated. To evaluate the effect of each bubble type, the volumetric mass transfer coefficients for microbubbles and conventional bubbles were determined. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient was 0.02905 s(-1) and 0.02191 s(-1) at a gas flow rate of 0.67 L min(-1) in tap water for microbubbles and conventional bubbles, respectively. The degradation rate of simulated municipal wastewater was also investigated, using aerobic activated sludge and ozone. Compared with the conventional bubble generator, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate was 2.04, 5.9, 3.26 times higher than those of the conventional bubble contactor at the same initial COD concentration of COD 200 mg L(-1), 400 mg L(-1), and 600 mg L(-1), while aerobic activated sludge was used. For the ozonation process, the rate of COD removal using microbubble generator was 2.38, 2.51, 2.89 times of those of the conventional bubble generator. Based on the results, the effect of initial COD concentration on the specific COD degradation rate were discussed in different systems. Thus, the results revealed that microbubbles could enhance mass transfer in wastewater treatment and be an effective method to improve the degradation of wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China E-mail: chiyong@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Kangning", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China E-mail: chiyong@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China E-mail: chiyong@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China E-mail: chiyong@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jianhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China E-mail: chiyong@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Mingjiang", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China E-mail: chiyong@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cen", "ForeName": "Kefa", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbubbles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27120652", "10.2166/wst.2016.018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
