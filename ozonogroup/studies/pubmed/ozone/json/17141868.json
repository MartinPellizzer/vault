From sowing, beans were exposed to non-filtered air (NF) and NF supplied with 40 (+40) and 80 (+80) nL L(-1) O(3). Twenty days after emergence, primary and first trifoliate leaves were sampled. Biochemical characteristics of leaves from +40 were quite similar to those from NF. Conversely, +80 induced distinct biochemical effects in primary and first trifoliate leaves. Regarding primary leaves, +80 reduced ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activity by 33% whereas it stimulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) activity by 376%. The reduction in Rubisco activity was accompanied by a decrease in both Rubisco subunit amounts and a consistent oxidative modification of the Rubisco small subunit (SSU). These changes came with a drastic loss in pigmentation. Regarding first trifoliate leaves, +80 stimulated Rubisco activity by 33% while it disturbed neither PEPc activity nor pigmentation. Surprisingly, the enhanced Rubisco activity was associated with a slight decrease in Rubisco protein quantity, which was not coupled with the formation of carbonyl groups in Rubisco-SSU."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire d'Ecologie Mol\u00e9culaire, EA 3525, IBEAS, Universit\u00e9 de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, Pau Cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leitao", "ForeName": "Louis", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dizengremel", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Biolley", "ForeName": "Jean-Philippe", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Phaseolus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17141868", "10.1016/j.ecoenv.2006.10.010", "S0147-6513(06)00207-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
