In the present study, the enhancing effect of 3-chlorophenol on OH radical generation was mathematically evaluated using electron spin resonance (ESR)/spin-trapping technique. OH radical was trapped with a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a stable adduct, DMPO-OH. The initial velocity of DMPO-OH generation in ozonated water containing 3-chlorophenol was quantitatively measured using a combined system of ESR spectroscopy with stopped-flow apparatus which was controlled by home-made software. The initial velocity of DMPO-OH generation increased as a function of the concentration of ozone and the more effectively of 3-chlorophenol concentration. The relation among ozone concentration, amount of 3-chlorophenol and the initial velocity (nu(0)) of DMPO-OH generation was mathematically analyzed and the following equation was obtained, nu(0) (10(-6)M/s)=[9.7 x [3-chlorophenol (10(-9)M)] + 0.0005]exp(57 x [ozone (10(-9)M)]). The equation fitted very well with the experimental results, and the correlation coefficient was larger than 0.99. The equation for the enhancing effect by 3-chlorophenol should provide useful information to optimize the condition in ozone treatment process of water containing phenolic pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio-function analysis, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan. utsumi@pch.phar.kyushu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utsumi", "ForeName": "Hideo", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Youn-Hee", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichikawa", "ForeName": "Kazuhiro", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z2Z7M2FTAD", "NameOfSubstance": "3-chlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14604638", "10.1016/j.watres.2003.07.006", "S0043-1354(03)00457-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
