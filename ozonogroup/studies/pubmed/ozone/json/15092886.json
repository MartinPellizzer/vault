Ambient ozone levels were high in both years with values exceeding the threshold for leaf injury reported in the literature. In both years ozone injury was observed on the sensitive clone (NC-S) but not on the resistant one (NC-R), and leaf and stolon dry matter production was significantly lower in NC-S than in NC-R. However, it cannot be excluded that other factors, such as high temperature, interacted with the effect of ozone on biomass production. The clones differed in morphological characteristics. Lower total leaf area in NC-S plants was due to a smaller number of leaves per plant, but the average area per leaf was higher in NC-S. Specific leaf weight and net assimilation rate were higher in the more productive clone (NC-R). Cumulative plant water use was higher in NC-R in each growth period because of the larger leaf area; by contrast, water use per unit leaf area was higher in NC-S, indicating higher leaf conductance to water vapour. The results suggest that ozone significantly reduces the yield of sensitive white clover plants under well-watered conditions, and that the difference in ozone tolerance between clover clones is related to differences in leaf morphology and water use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento Ingegneria Agraria ed Agronomia del Territorio, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Via Universit\u00e0 100, I-80055 Portici (NA), Italy. postigli@unina.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Postiglione", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fagnano", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merola", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092886", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00056-7", "S0269-7491(00)00056-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
