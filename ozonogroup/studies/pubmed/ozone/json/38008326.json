Pollutant concentrations can be controlled locally using portable air cleaners (sometimes called air purifiers), which allow occupants to apply air cleaning technology to meet their needs in the location and times that they find appropriate. This paper provides a systematic review of scientific literature that describes field studies of the effectiveness of portable air cleaners. Over 500 papers were considered, and 148 were reviewed in detail, to extract 35 specific research results (e.g., particulate removal performance) or characteristics (e.g., type of building). These were aggregated to provide an overview of results and approaches to this type of research, and to provide meta-analyses of the results. The review includes: descriptions of the geographical location of the research; rate of publications over time; types of buildings and occupants in the field study; types of air cleaner technology being tested; pollutants being measured; resulting pollutant removal effectiveness; patterns of usage and potential barriers to usage by occupants; and the potential for by-product emissions in some air cleaner technologies. An example result is that 83 of the 148 papers measured reductions in fine particulates (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and found a mean reduction of 49\u00a0% with standard deviation of 20\u00a0%. The aggregated results were approximately normally distributed, ranging from finding no significant reduction up to a maximum above 90\u00a0% reduction. Sixteen of the 148 papers considered gaseous pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone; 36 papers considered biological pollutants, such as bacteria, viruses, pollen, fungi, etc. An important challenge, common to several studies, is that occupants run the air cleaners for shorter periods and on low airflow rate settings, because of concerns about noise, drafts, and electricity cost, which significantly reduces air cleaning effectiveness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
