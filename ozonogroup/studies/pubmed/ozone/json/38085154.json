Two oxygen gas flow rates (4 and 1 L/min) used in ozone NB generation affected the characteristics and stability of ozone NBs. The ozone NBs generated at a high initial dissolved ozone (12.5 mg/L) concentration showed a much higher brightness during measurements than the ozone NBs generated at a low initial dissolved ozone concentration (1 mg/L). The former also exhibited a higher negative surface charge and higher stability in comparison to the latter. The stability and half-lives of ozone NBs followed the order of 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> < pH 3 < NOM with high specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA<sub>254</sub> = 4.1 L/mg\u00b7m) < pH 7 < pH 9, while the effects of carbonate and temperature were insignificant. Ozone NBs were relatively stable in waters for a long period (e.g., \u2265 60 days) except for high hardness or low pH conditions. Higher levels of hydroxyl radicals were produced from ozone NB solutions as compared to conventional ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Anderson, South Carolina 29625, United States."}], "LastName": "Soyluoglu", "ForeName": "Meryem", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Anderson, South Carolina 29625, United States."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Daekyun", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0986-5628"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Anderson, South Carolina 29625, United States."}], "LastName": "Karanfil", "ForeName": "Tanju", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38085154", "10.1021/acs.est.3c07443"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
