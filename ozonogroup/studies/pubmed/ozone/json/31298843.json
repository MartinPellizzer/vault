Despite this, their atmospheric chemistry and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potentials are still not well-known under complex pollution conditions. In this work, we examined the impact of SO<sub>2</sub>, relative humidity (RH), and particle acidity on the formation and oxidation state (OSc) of SOA from butyl vinyl ether (BVE) ozonolysis. Increasing SO<sub>2</sub> concentration produced a notable promotion of SOA formation and OSc due to the significant increase in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> particles and formation of more highly oxidized components. Increased RH in the presence of SO<sub>2</sub> appeared to promote, suppress, and dominate the formation and OSc of SOA in the dry range (1-10%), low RH range (10-42%), and moderate RH range (42-64%), respectively. This highlights the importance of competition between H<sub>2</sub>O and SO<sub>2</sub> in reacting with the stabilized Criegee intermediate in BVE ozonolysis at ambient RH. Increased particle acidity mainly contributed to the change in chemical composition of BVE-dominated SOA but not to SOA formation. The results presented here extend previous analysis of BVE-derived SOA and further aid our understanding of SOA formation potential of BVE ozonolysis under highly complex pollution conditions."]},
