These materials contact organic pollutants due to their widespread presence in the environment or through their use in various engineering applications. This review covers recent advances in our understanding of adsorption and chemical reactions mediated by PCM and the links between these processes. It also covers adsorptive processes previously receiving little attention and ignored in models such as steric constraints, physicochemical effects of confinement in nanopores, \u03c0 interactions of aromatic compounds with polyaromatic surfaces, and very strong hydrogen bonding of ionizable compounds with surface functional groups. Although previous research has regarded carbons merely as passive sorbents, recent studies show that PCM can promote chemical reactions of sorbed contaminants at ordinary temperature, including long-range electron conduction between molecules and between microbes and molecules, local redox reactions between molecules, and hydrolysis. PCM may itself contain redox-active functional groups that are capable of oxidizing or reducing organic compounds and of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) from oxygen, peroxides, or ozone. Amorphous carbons contain persistent free radicals that may play a role in observed redox reactions and ROS generation. Reactions mediated by PCM can impact the biogeochemical fate of pollutants and lead to useful strategies for remediation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2772-5250"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station , New Haven, Connecticut 06504-1106, United States."}], "LastName": "Pignatello", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4917-0938"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Villanova University , Villanova, Pennsylvania 19085, United States."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wenqing", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7782-42-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Graphite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Graphite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28753285", "10.1021/acs.est.7b01088"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
