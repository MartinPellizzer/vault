Data on ambient temperature and relative air humidity (RH) and PM<sub>10</sub> and ozone was collected from nearby monitoring stations. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR).", "14.1% had current respiratory infections (last 7 days), 32.1% had any respiratory infection last 3 months, and 26.1% had any respiratory infection last 12 months with antibiotic treatment. Students with diagnosed allergy (7.7%) and diagnosed asthma (4.7%) had more often respiratory infections (ORs 1.40-5.40; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Current respiratory infections were more common in dry (18.1%) than in wet season (10.4%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and was associated with indoor mould (OR 2.16; p\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and outdoor RH (OR 1.34 per 10% RH; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004.) in the total material. In wet season, mould (OR 2.32; p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), window pane condensation (OR 1.79; p\u00a0=\u00a00.050), water leakage (OR 1.82; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (OR 2.34; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and outdoor RH (OR 2.70 per 10% RH; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) were risk factors for current respiratory infections. In dry season, mould (OR 2.64; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and outdoor RH (OR 1.34 per 10% RH; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) were associated with current respiratory infections. Irrespectively of season, biomass burning inside or outside the home was a risk factor for respiratory infections (ORs 1.32-2.34; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Living in a wooden house decreased the risk of respiratory infections (OR 0.56: p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).", "Dry season, high outdoor RH, household dampness, indoor mould and ETS can increase childhood respiratory infections. Living in a traditional wooden house can reduce respiratory infections, possibly due to better natural ventilation.
