Laboratory experiments and field observations have revealed efficient HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous uptake on wet aerosols, but its impact on the O<sub>3</sub> formation remains controversial. A severe and persistent O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode has been simulated using the WRF-Chem model to evaluate the impacts of the HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous loss on the O<sub>3</sub> formation in the North China Plain (NCP) during the summertime of 2018. Comparisons between experimental simulations with the HO<sub>2</sub> effective uptake coefficient of 0.2 and 0.0 shows that the HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous loss decreases the daytime HO<sub>2</sub> and maximum daily average 8-hour (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by about 5% and 1% in the NCP, respectively. Emission mitigation from 2013 to 2018 is found to contribute a 2.1 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> (5%) increase in the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration due to decreased aerosol sink for the HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous loss in the NCP. Our results reveal that decreased HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous uptake does not constitute an important factor driving the O<sub>3</sub> trend since 2013 in the NCP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
