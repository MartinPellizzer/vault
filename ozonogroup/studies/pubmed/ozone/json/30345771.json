DM was induced by a single intraperitoneal (ip) streptozotocin injection (60 mg/kg), followed by 3 IU (ip) insulin administration for 60 days. Next, 1.1 mg/kg (50 \u03bcg/ml) ozone was administered to the O, DO, and DOI groups for 60 days. After inducing diabetes, the total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were measured; the oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated. The brain and spinal cord tissues were obtained for histopathological evaluation. This cross sectional study was conducted in Dumlupinar University Laboratory Animals Research Center e.g 11.03.2015 \u2012 15.05.2015.", "TAS was higher in the DO, DI, and DOI groups than in the D group.
