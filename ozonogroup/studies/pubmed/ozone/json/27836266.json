The experimental results indicate that the relationship between the ozone concentration, germ concentration, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) can be used to predict variations in germ and COD concentrations. The ozone reaction with COD and inactivation of Legionella occurred simultaneously, but the reaction with COD likely occurred at a higher rate than the inactivation, as COD is more easily oxidized by ozone than Legionella. Higher initial COD concentrations resulted in a lower inactivation rate and higher lnN/N<sub>0</sub>. Higher temperature led to a higher inactivation efficiency. The relationship of the initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration and Legionella inactivation rate was not linear, and thus, the Ct value required for a 99.99% reduction was not constant. The initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration was more important than the contact time, and a reduction of the initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration could not be compensated by increasing the contact time. The Ct values were compared over a narrow range of initial concentrations; the Ct values could only be contrasted when the initial O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were very similar. A higher initial O<sub>3</sub> concentration led to a higher inflection point value for the lnN/N<sub>0</sub> vs C<sub>0</sub>t curve. Energy consumption using a plasma corona was lower than when using boron-doped diamond electrodes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
