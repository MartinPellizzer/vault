These species may play an important role in ozone-driven inorganic aerosol formation; however their chemical properties remain largely unknown. This is the issue addressed in this work using negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) and ab initio modeling. The NIPE spectra reveal that all of the three anionic species are characterized by high adiabatic detachment energies (ADEs) - 4.62 \u00b1 0.10, 4.52 \u00b1 0.10, and 4.60 \u00b1 0.10 eV for ISO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, IS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and IS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, respectively. Vibrational progressions with frequencies assigned to the S-O symmetric stretching modes are discernable in the ground state transition features. Density functional theory calculations show the presence of several low-lying isomers involving different bonding scenarios. Further analysis based on high level CCSD(T) calculations reveal that the lowest energy structures are characterized by the formation of I-S and S-S bonds and can be structurally viewed as SO<sub>3</sub> linked with I, IS, and ISO for ISO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, IS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and IS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, respectively. The calculated ADEs and vertical detachment energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, further supporting the identified minimum energy structures. The obtained intrinsic molecular properties of these anionic intermediates and neutral radicals should be useful to help understand their photochemical reactions in the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Optoelectric Materials Science and Technology Laboratory, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, Anhui 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Zhengbo", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, P.O.
