The treatment, comprising ozonization, electrostimulation, vasodilators, and an unknown surgical procedure after O. Pelaez, is said to stop the progression of the disease. While the nature of the operation remains unclear and scientific proof of its efficacy is still absent, reports about persisting active and passive impairments of ocular motility are becoming more frequent. The authors present the pre-, intra- and postoperative findings in two patients who developed persisting diplopia after Pelaez's operation. In both cases, one with +14\u00b0 esotropia, the other with up to 25\u00b0 incyclotropia and bilateral Brown's syndrome, binocular single vision was restored by recession of the medial rectus and superior oblique muscles. Comparing the functional findings before and one year after 'Cuba-therapy', the treatment fails to prevent progressive loss of visual acuity and visual field. Therefore, the Cuban treatment trial should not be recommended in retinitis pigmentosa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Hamburg, Eye Clinic, Department of Pleoptics and Orthoptics, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berger", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haase", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerding", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Strabismus", "NlmUniqueID": "9310896", "ISSNLinking": "0927-3972"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21314532", "10.3109/09273979509066095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
