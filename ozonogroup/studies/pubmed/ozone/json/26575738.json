The GASSCF method enables the exploration of larger active spaces than with the conventional complete active space SCF, (CASSCF), by fragmentation of a large space into subspaces and by controlling the interspace excitations. In the SplitGAS method, the GAS configuration interaction, CI, expansion is further partitioned in two parts: the principal, which includes the most important configuration state functions, and an extended, containing less relevant but not negligible ones. An effective Hamiltonian is then generated, with the extended part acting as a perturbation to the principal space. Excitation energies of ozone, furan, pyrrole, nickel dioxide, and copper tetrachloride dianion are reported. Various partitioning schemes of the GASSCF and SplitGAS CI expansions are considered and compared with the complete active space followed by second-order perturbation theory, (CASPT2), and multireference CI method, (MRCI), or available experimental data. General guidelines for the optimum applicability of these methods are discussed together with their current limitations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Theory Center, and Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota , Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455-0431, United States."}], "LastName": "Vogiatzis", "ForeName": "Konstantinos D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Theory Center, and Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota , Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455-0431, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Festk\u00f6rperforschung , Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "LastName": "Li Manni", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Theory Center, and Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota , Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455-0431, United States."}], "LastName": "Stoneburner", "ForeName": "Samuel J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Theory Center, and Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota , Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455-0431, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Festk\u00f6rperforschung , Heisenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Dongxia", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Theory Center, and Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota , Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455-0431, United States."}], "LastName": "Gagliardi", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26575738", "10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
