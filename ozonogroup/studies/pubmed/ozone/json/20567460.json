This lidar is located at an elevation of 2300 m in the San Gabriel Mountains, Southern California, and has been in operation since Jan.1988. A high power (100-W) excimer laser system and a 90-cm diam telescope are used to achieve the desired performance levels. This paper describes the implementation of the system and its operation including the procedures for data analysis. Examples of ozone profiles measured, and intercomparisons with measurements made by other instruments, are presented which show that the lidar, in its present configuration, is capable of producing high quality ozone measurements from 20 km up to at least 45 km."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDermid", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godin", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lindqvist", "ForeName": "L O", "Initials": "LO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20567460", "10.1364/AO.29.003603", "38379"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
