Single-pollutant models showed O(3) lagged 0 day, CO lagged 2 days, and PM(2.5) and PM(10) lagged 3 days were significantly associated with increasing emergency admissions for cerebrovascular diseases and CO lagged 2 days was significantly associated with increasing emergency admissions for strokes (ICD-9-CM, 430-434). Such association remained significant for O(3), CO, and cerebrovascular admissions after adjusting for PM(2.5) and PM(10) in two-pollutant models. The odds ratios were 1.021-1.022 per 31.3 ppb O(3) and 1.023-1.031 per 0.8 ppm CO, respectively. However, only CO was significantly associated with emergency admissions for stroke in the three-pollutant models with CO, O(3), and PM(2.5) or PM(10).", "Emergency admissions for cerebrovascular diseases among adults were positively associated with increasing urban air pollution levels of O(3) lagged 0 day and CO lagged 2 days in Taipei."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Rm. 722, 7F, No. 17, Xu-Zhou Road, Taipei 100, Taiwan, ROC. ccchan@ntu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Chang-Chuan", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chuang", "ForeName": "Kai-Jen", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chien", "ForeName": "Lung-Chang", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wen-Jone", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Wei-Tien", "Initials": "WT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Heart J", "NlmUniqueID": "8006263", "ISSNLinking": "0195-668X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrovascular Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergencies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16537554", "10.1093/eurheartj/ehi835", "ehi835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
