In this study, nanostructured Bi<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>6</sub> was prepared by hydrothermal method and applied in the photocatalytic ozonation process for tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) degradation under simulated solar light irradiation. Bi<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>6</sub> triggered an effective synergy between photocatalysis and ozonation, and it showed a good activity and adaptability in the degradation of organic compounds. Besides, the influence of experimental factors on the total organic carbon removal (including catalyst dosage, ozone concentration, initial pH, reaction temperature and coexisting ions) was also investigated comprehensively. Spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and quenching experiments demonstrated that O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, OH, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and h<sup>+</sup>\u00a0contributed to TCH degradation. The possible degradation pathways of TCH were proposed by identifying the intermediates with liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
