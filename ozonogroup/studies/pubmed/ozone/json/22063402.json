Beef trimmings were inoculated with Escherichia coli (EC) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST), then treated with either 1% ozonated water for 7 min (7O) or 15 min (15O), or with 200 ppm chlorine dioxide (CLO) and compared with a control (C). Trimmings were ground, packaged and sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 days of display for EC, ST, coliforms (CO), aerobic plate counts (APC), instrumental color, as well as sensory color and odor characteristics. The 15O and CLO treatments reduced (P<0.05) all bacterial types evaluated, whereas the 7O treatment reduced (P<0.05) APC and ST. All treatments caused ground beef to become lighter (L*) in color (P<0.05); however, the 15O treatment was similar (P>0.05) in redness (a*), percentage discoloration, beef odor and off odor intensities when compared to C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Griffith Laboratories, Griffith Center, Alsip, IL 60658, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stivarius", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pohlman", "ForeName": "F W", "Initials": "FW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McElyea", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Apple", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Meat Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101160862", "ISSNLinking": "0309-1740"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22063402", "10.1016/s0309-1740(01)00139-5", "S0309-1740(01)00139-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
