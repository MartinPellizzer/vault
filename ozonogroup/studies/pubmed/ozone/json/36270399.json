Seeking a solution against skin exposure to excessive radiation is an urgent requirement. In this study, nicotinamide (NA), the main component of vitamin B3, was introduced as a new modifier into Tempo-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNFs) together with the physical cross-linking with tannin acid (TA) to improve anti-UV performance of the nanocomposite films. Incorporation of NA into the films presents distinguished UV shielding capability UVB wavelength range from 200\u00a0nm to 320\u00a0nm (NTA1-5) due to the introduced functional groups like CO and benzene rings. Moreover, mechanical properties were notably enhanced, which overcome the low strength of common nanocellulosic materials. The stress increased from 69.8\u00a0MPa to 116.3\u00a0MPa, and the toughness can reach 131.58\u00a0MJ/m<sup>3</sup> by tuning the additional amount of NA. Meanwhile, TGA and DTG analysis demonstrated that the incorporation of amide bonds and TA into the composite films greatly improved the thermal stability. Thus, the proposed materials fabricated from natural biomolecules show great potential in serving as new kinds of UV-resistant products in the application areas of sunscreen, protective clothing, and building materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
