On average, there are four to five dust events and 6.1 dust days in a year in Taiwan. Each event lasts for 1 day or even longer. A procedure to identify a dust event is rationalized and exercised on data collected during 1994-2005. Also, a ranking method named as the dust intensity rank (DIR) is developed to distinguish the intensity of each event affecting the local air quality. About 86% of dust days belong to ranks 1 and 2. In general, poorer air quality is associated with higher ranks. Ranks 4 and 5 correspond to a PSI (Pollution Standard Index) larger than 100. Linking DIR with the popular PSI is useful for both the public and the official forecasting system. It is also useful for inter-comparison between dust influences on air quality at different downstream regions in Taiwan. Composite analyses of the temporal and spatial variation of the hourly PM10 level indicate that dust particles usually arrive 12 h before the time of the peak PM10 concentration and last for 36 h at northern Taiwan, while the time of the peak concentration at eastern or western Taiwan, due to the evolution of the synoptic weather system, is about 3-12 h later. It is noted that the increase of PM10 level at the western side of Taiwan results from a mixture of upstream Asian dust inputs and local pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Protection Administration, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC. liucm@ntu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chung-Ming", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "Chea-Yuan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yen-Chih", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16674998", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.03.039", "S0048-9697(06)00263-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
