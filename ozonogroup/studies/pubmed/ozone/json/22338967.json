Further, to estimate a time for onset of the disturbance and investigate possible etiological factors.", "22 teeth diagnosed with MIH were used in the histological and chemical studies. A number of analytical methods were used; Light microscopy, Polarized light microscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis, Vickers hardness test and X-ray Micro Computed Tomography. Decalcified sections were stained with bacterial staining. An ozone device was tested for the ability to kill strains of oral bacteria. In collaboration with the prospective ABIS study, 17.000 individuals were examined and possible etiological causes of severe demarcated opacities were tested.", "The hypomineralized enamel was mainly located in the buccal enamel of the teeth and had a high degree of porosity extending from enamel-dentin-junction with a distinct border to the normal cervical enamel. Teeth diagnosed MIH had lower hardness values in hypomineralized enamel and differences in the chemical composition. Bacteria were observed in the enamel and deep into the dentin. Ozone treatment for 20 seconds or more was effective to kill oral microorganisms. Significant relations were found between MIH in first molars and breast feeding more than 6 months, late introduction to gruel and infant formula (later than 6 months). The onset for the hypomineralized enamel was estimated to around 200 days from start of the enamel mineralization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Odontology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.
