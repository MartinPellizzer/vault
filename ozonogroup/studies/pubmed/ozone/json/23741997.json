Groups of patients received: (1) Scaling and root planing (SRP)+Er:YAG laser; (2) SRP+topical gaseous ozone; or (3) SRP alone. The microbiological and clinical parameters were monitored at day 0 and day 90.", "At the end of the observation period, statistically significant improvements in clinical parameters were observed within each group. Parallel to the clinical changes, all treatments reduced the number of total bacteria and the proportion of obligately anaerobic microorganisms. Although intergroup comparisons of microbiological parameters showed no significant differences, clinical findings, including attachment gain and PD reduction, were found to be statistically significant in favor of the SRP+Er:YAG laser group.", "Although statistically nonsignificant, the fact that the obligate anaerobic change was mostly observed in the SRP+Er:YAG laser group, and a similar decrease was noted in the SRP+topical gaseous ozone group, shows that ozone has an antimicrobial effect equivalent to that of the Er:YAG laser."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Y\u0131lmaz", "ForeName": "Sel\u00e7uk", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Algan", "ForeName": "Serdar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gursoy", "ForeName": "Hare", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noyan", "ForeName": "Ulku", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuru", "ForeName": "Bahar Eren", "Initials": "BE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kadir", "ForeName": "Tanju", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photomed Laser Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101222340", "ISSNLinking": "1549-5418"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Scaling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Solid-State"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Pocket"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23741997", "10.1089/pho.2012.3379"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
