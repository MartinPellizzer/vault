Model skylight consists of sunbeams that are scattered toward the observer, but depleted by scattering and absorption in the Chappuis bands of ozone. SKYCOLOR includes the Earth's curvature, atmospheric refraction, cloud shadows, and solar eclipses. Scattering is given a wavelength (lambda) dependence of lambda(-4) for air molecules (Rayleigh scattering), lambda(-1) for tropospheric aerosols, and lambda(+1) for volcanic aerosol particles. Multiple scattering is calculated directly in clouds but is parameterized in clear air by decreasing the scattering rates of sunlight and of skylight in the Earth's shadow by 30%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, NOAA CREST Center, City College of New York, New York, New York 10031, USA. sgedzelman@ccny.cuny.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gedzelman", "ForeName": "Stanley David", "Initials": "SD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16201435", "10.1364/ao.44.005723"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
