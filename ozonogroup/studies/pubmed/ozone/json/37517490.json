We tried to assess the association between (short- and long-term) exposure to particulate and gaseous pollutants, SARS-CoV-2 infections, and immune response in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs) with well-characterized individual data. We collected occupational and clinical characteristics of all HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 at the Policlinico Hospital in Milan (Lombardy, Italy) between February 24, 2020 (day after first documented case of COVID-19 in our hospital) and December 26, 2020 (day before start of the vaccination campaign). Each subject was assigned daily average levels of particulate matter \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) retrieved from the air quality monitoring station closest to his/her residential address. Air pollution data were treated as time-dependent variables, generating person-days at risk. Multivariate Poisson regression models were fit to evaluate the rate of positive NPS and to assess the association between air pollution and antibody titer among NPS-positive HCWs. Among 3712 included HCWs, 635 (17.1%) had at least one positive NPS. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>2</sub> average concentration in the four days preceding NPS was associated with a higher risk of testing positive [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)\u00a0=\u00a01.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01; 1.16)]. When considering a 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in 2019 annual NO<sub>2</sub> average, we observed a higher risk of infection (IRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.00; 1.03) and an increased antibody titer (+2.4%, 95%CI: 1.1; 3.6%). Findings on PM10 and O<sub>3</sub> were less consistent and, differently from NO<sub>2</sub>, were not confirmed in multipollutant models. Our study increases the body of evidence suggesting an active role of air pollution exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirms the importance of implementing pollution reduction policies to improve public health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
