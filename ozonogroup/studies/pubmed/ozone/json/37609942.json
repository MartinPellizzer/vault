However, the real-time VOC emissions from cooking are not well characterised, and similarly, the resulting secondary chemistry is poorly understood. Here, selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) was used to monitor the real-time VOC emissions during the cooking of a scripted chicken and vegetable stir-fry meal, in a room scale, semi-realistic environment. The VOC emissions were dominated by alcohols (70% of total emission), but also contained a range of aldehydes (14%) and terpenes (5%), largely attributable to the heating of oil and the preparation and heating of spices, respectively. The direct cooking-related VOC emissions were then simulated using the Indoor Chemical Model in Python (INCHEM-Py), to investigate the resulting secondary chemistry. Modelling revealed that VOC concentrations were dominated by direct emissions, with only a small contribution from secondary products, though the secondary species were longer lived than the directly emitted species. Following cooking, hydroxyl radical concentrations reduced by 86%, while organic peroxy radical levels increased by over 700%, later forming secondary organic nitrates, peroxyacylnitrates (PANs) and formaldehyde. Monoterpene emissions were shown to drive the formation of secondary formaldehyde, albeit to produce relatively modest concentrations (average of 60 ppt). Sensitivity analysis of the simulation conditions revealed that increasing the outdoor concentrations of ozone and NO<i>x</i> species (2.9\u00d7 and 9\u00d7, respectively) resulted in the greatest increase in secondary product formation indoors (\u2248400%, 200% and 600% increase in organic nitrates, PANs and formaldehyde production, respectively). Given the fact that climate change is likely to result in increased ozone concentrations in the future, and that increased window-opening in response to rising temperatures is also likely, higher concentrations of indoor oxidants are likely in homes in the future. This work, therefore, suggests that cooking could be a more important source of secondary pollutants indoors in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9016-9859"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Geography, University of York, Heslington, York, UK. nicola.carslaw@york.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "Helen L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1474-9779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University of York, Heslington, York, UK."}], "LastName": "O'Leary", "ForeName": "Catherine", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University of York, Heslington, York, UK."}], "LastName": "Dillon", "ForeName": "Terry", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5542-0334"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Geography, University of York, Heslington, York, UK. nicola.carslaw@york.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "David R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University of York, Heslington, York, UK."}], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "Marvin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4273-8199"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences, University of Chester, Chester, UK."}], "LastName": "Mehra", "ForeName": "Archit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences, University of Chester, Chester, UK."}], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Gavin", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5290-4779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Geography, University of York, Heslington, York, UK. nicola.carslaw@york.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Carslaw", "ForeName": "Nicola", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37609942", "10.1039/d3em00167a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
