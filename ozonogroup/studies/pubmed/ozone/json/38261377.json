This is often done to save computational time as the assumption is that the equilibrium is strongly towards the RO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> reaction for most conditions. Exceptions are the reactions of the methyl peroxy radical due to its abundance in the atmosphere and of acyl-RO<sub>2</sub> radicals due to the long lifetime of peroxyacyl nitrates RO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> (PANs). In this study, the nighttime oxidation of <i>cis</i>-2-butene and <i>trans</i>-2-hexene in the presence of NO<sub>2</sub> is investigated in the atmospheric simulation chamber SAPHIR, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Germany, at atmospherically-relevant conditions at different temperatures (\u2248276 K, \u2248293 K, \u2248305 K). Measured concentrations of peroxy and hydroperoxy radicals as well as other trace gases (ozone, NO<sub>2</sub>, volatile organic compounds) are compared to state-of-the-art zero-dimensional box model calculations. Good model-measurement agreement can only be achieved when reversible RO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub> reactions are included for all RO<sub>2</sub> species using literature values available from the latest SAR by [Jenkin <i>et al.</i>, <i>Atmos. Chem. Phys.</i>, 2019, <b>19</b>, 7691]. The good agreement observed gives confidence that the SAR, derived originally for aliphatic RO<sub>2</sub>, can be applied to a large range of substituted RO<sub>2</sub> radicals, simplifying generalised implementation in chemical models. RO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from non-acyl RO<sub>2</sub> radicals of up to 2 \u00d7 10 cm<sup>-3</sup> are predicted at 276 K, impacting effectively the kinetics of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals. Under these conditions, peroxy radicals are slowly regenerated downwind of the pollution source and may be lost in the atmosphere through deposition of RO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Based on this study, 60% of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals would be stored as RO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> at a temperature of 10 \u00b0C and in the presence of a few ppbv of NO<sub>2</sub>. The fraction increases further at colder temperatures and/or higher NO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratios. This does not only affect the expected concentrations of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals but, as the peroxynitrates can react with OH radicals or photolyse, they could comprise a net sink for RO<sub>2</sub> radicals as well as increase the production of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> (= NO + NO<sub>2</sub>) in different locations depending on their lifetime. Omitting this chemistry from the kinetic model can lead to misinterpreted product formation and may prevent reconciling observations and model predictions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0003-0302-6142"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "F\u00e4rber", "ForeName": "Michelle", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7845-684X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "Vereecken", "ForeName": "Luc", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1263-0061"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Cologne, 50932 Cologne, Germany."}], "LastName": "Fuchs", "ForeName": "Hendrik", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "Gkatzelis", "ForeName": "Georgios I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "Rohrer", "ForeName": "Franz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "Wedel", "ForeName": "Sergej", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8948-1928"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "Wahner", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2077-7573"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Energy and Climate Research, IEK-8: Troposphere, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, 52428 J\u00fclich, Germany. m.faerber@fz-juelich.de."}], "LastName": "Novelli", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Phys Chem Chem Phys. 2024 Feb 22;26(8):7239. doi: 10.1039/d4cp90031f", "PMID": "38344885"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38261377", "10.1039/d3cp04163h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
