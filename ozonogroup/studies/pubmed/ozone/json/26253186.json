V-Q Lissajous method, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) are used to characterize the DBD and catalysts. The DBD processing partially oxidizes the toluene, and the removal efficiency has a linear relationship with ozone generation. Three DBD-catalyst systems are compared in terms of their toluene removal efficiency, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, carbon balance, CO selectivity, CO2 selectivity, and ozone residual. The results show that the DBD-catalyst system with CoMnO(x)/ZSM-5 performs better than the other two systems. It has the highest removal efficiency of about 93.7%, and the corresponding energy yield is 4.22 g/kWh. The carbon balance and CO2 selectivity of CoMnO(x)/ZSM-5 is also better than the other two catalysts. The measurements of two important byproducts including aerosols and ozone are also presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Ecology and Environment Research, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yifan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Ecology and Environment Research, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Shaolong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, Jiaying University, Meizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Fada", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Ecology and Environment Research, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuming", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. zliu@zju.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Ecology and Environment Research, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. zliu@zju.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Ecology and Environment Research, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Keping", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G0H8C9362", "NameOfSubstance": "Cobalt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "64J2OA7MH3", "NameOfSubstance": "manganese oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cobalt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2015 Jun 2;49(11):6831-7", "ArticleIdList": ["25941906"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26253186", "10.1007/s11356-015-5121-3", "10.1007/s11356-015-5121-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
