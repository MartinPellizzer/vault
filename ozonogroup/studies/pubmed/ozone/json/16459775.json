At 37 degrees C, pH 7.1-8.5 and a HRT of 5.1-6.6 days, the process removed 66-90% of COD in the leachate for loading rates of 1-2.4 g-COD/l day depending on the strength of landfill leachate. The final effluent contained 1440-1910 mg-COD/l and 70-91 mg-BOD/l. About 92.5% of the total COD removed was converted to methane and the rest was converted to biomass with an average net growth yield of 0.053 g-VSS/g-COD-removed. The granules developed in the UASB reactor were 0.5-1.5 mm in size and exhibited good settleability. The UASB effluent was then further polished by two oxidation processes. The UASB-ozonation process removed 93.0% of the 12900 mg/l of COD from the raw leachate. The UASB-Fenton-ozonation process improved the COD removal efficiency to 99.3%. The final effluent had only 85 mg/l of COD and 10 mg/l of BOD5. Ozonation was most effectively conducted at pH 7-8 with the addition of 300 mg/l of H2O2 and for the duration of 30 min. Ozonation also significantly improved the biodegradability of the organic residues. Nearly 50% of these residues could be used as carbon source in denitrification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental Engineering Research, Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "H H P", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "I W C", "Initials": "IW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16459775"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
