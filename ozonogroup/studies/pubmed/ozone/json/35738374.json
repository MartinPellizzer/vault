In this study, an intensive sampling campaign was performed in a gasoline service station, to reveal emission characteristics, environmental and health impacts of VOCs. It was strikingly found that 24 % of air samples exceeded the national standard of 4 mg/m<sup>3</sup> for non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) on the boundary of the station, with the equipment of Stage I and II controls. VOC groups and species profiles showed that alkanes dominated total VOCs. As typical markers of evaporative loss of gasoline, C4-5 species (i-pentane, n-pentane and n-butane) as well as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) accounted for 49.6 % of VOCs. Species profile and diagnostic ratios indicated the prominent contribution of gasoline evaporative losses from refueling or breathing processes, as well as the interference of vehicle exhaust in the ambient air at the site. Intensive O<sub>3</sub> production was reproduced by the photochemical box model, demonstrating that O<sub>3</sub> formation was co-limited by both VOCs (especially trans-2-butene) and NO<sub>x</sub>. Inhalation health risk assessment proved that exposure to hazardous VOCs caused non-cancer risk (HQ = 3.08) and definitely posed cancer risks at a probability of 1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> to workers. Remarkable health risks were mainly imposed by halocarbons, aromatics and alkenes, in which 1,2-dichloropropane caused the highest non-cancer risk (HQ = 1.3) and acted as the primary carcinogen (ICR = 5.1 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup>). This study elucidated the high unqualified rate in gasoline service stations after the implementation of latest standards in China, where new regulations targeted halocarbons and updates in existing vapor recovery systems were suggested for VOC mitigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
