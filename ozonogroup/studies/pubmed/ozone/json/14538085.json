In a biological process, the more organic carbon utilized in carbon dioxide production, the fewer sludge produced, and vice versa. This paper, therefore, reviews strategies developed for minimization of excess sludge production, such as oxic-settling-anaerobic process, high dissolved oxygen process, uncoupler-containing activated sludge process, ozonation-combined activated sludge process, control of sludge retention time and biodegradation of sludge in membrane-assisted reactor. In these modified activated sludge processes, excess sludge production can be reduced by 20-100% without significant effect on process efficiency and stability. It is expected that this paper would be helpful for researchers and engineers to develop novel and efficient operation strategy to minimize sludge production from biological systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Research Center, School of Civil and Structural Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore. cyliu@ntu.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tay", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Adv", "NlmUniqueID": "8403708", "ISSNLinking": "0734-9750"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14538085", "10.1016/s0734-9750(00)00066-5", "S0734-9750(00)00066-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
