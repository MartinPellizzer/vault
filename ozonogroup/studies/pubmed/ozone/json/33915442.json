Increased UV-B radiation poses a major threat to ecosystems. Although many studies have focused on the potential effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on plants, the dynamic changes of defense response in plants under continuous UV-B radiation remains enigmatic. In this study, we investigated the effect of UV-B radiation at 0.024\u00a0W/m<sup>2</sup> on the UVR8-and reactive oxygen species (ROS-) signaling pathways, antioxidant system, and wax synthesis of G. uralensis. These parameters were investigated at different UV-B radiation stages (2\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, and 96\u00a0h). The results revealed that the uvr8 expression level was significantly repressed after 2\u00a0h of UV-B radiation, partly because G. uralensis rapidly acclimated to UV-B. Significant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation occurred after 12\u00a0h UV-B radiation, resulting in activation of the ROS signaling pathway and the antioxidant system. After 24\u00a0h of UV-B radiation, wax synthesis was enhanced alongside a decrease in the capacity of the main antioxidant system. The dynamic and ordered changes in these pathways reveal how different strategies function in G. uralensis at different times during adaption to enhanced UV-B radiation. This study will help us better understand dynamic changes of defense response in plant under enhanced UV-B radiation, further providing fundamental knowledge to develop plant resistance gene resources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
