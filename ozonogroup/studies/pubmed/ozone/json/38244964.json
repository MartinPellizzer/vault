In this work, intraday O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity evolution from VOC-limited (volatile organic compound) regime in the forenoon to transition regime in the late afternoon was inferred by relative incremental reactivity (RIR) in summer 2019\u00a0at Xianghe, a suburban site in BTH region, suggesting that VOC-focused control policy could combine with stringent afternoon NO<sub>x</sub> control. Then detailed impacts of VOC subgroups on O<sub>3</sub> formation were further comprehensively quantified by parametric OH reactivity (K<sup>OH</sup>), O<sub>3</sub> formation potential (OFP), as well as RIR weighted value and O<sub>3</sub> formation path tracing (OFPT) approach based on photochemical box model. O<sub>3</sub> episode days corresponded to stronger O<sub>3</sub> formation, depicted by higher K<sup>OH</sup> (10.4 s<sup>-1</sup>), OFP (331.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>), RIR weighted value (1.2), and F(O<sub>3</sub>)-OFPT (15.5\u00a0ppbv\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>). High proportions of isoprene and OVOCs (oxygenated VOCs) to the total K<sup>OH</sup> and the OFPT method were demonstrated whereas results of OFP and RIR-weighted presented extra great impacts of aromatics on O<sub>3</sub> formation. The OFPT approach captured the process that has already happened and included final O<sub>3</sub> response to the original VOC, thus reliable for replicating VOC impacts. The comparison results of the four methods showed similarities when utilizing K<sup>OH</sup> and OFPT methods, which reveals that the potential applicability of simple K<sup>OH</sup> for contingency VOC control and more complex OFPT method for detailed VOC- and source-oriented control during policy-making. To investigate propulsion of VOC-involved O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry, atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) was quantified by two atmospheric oxidation indexes (AOI). Both AOIp_G (7.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> molec cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, potential AOC calculated by oxidation reaction rates) and AOIe_G (8.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, estimated AOC given redox electron transfer for oxidation products) were stronger on O<sub>3</sub> episode days, indicating that AOC promoted the radical cycling initiated from VOC oxidation and subsequent O<sub>3</sub> production. Result-oriented AOIe_G reasonably characterized actual AOC inferred by good linear correlation between AOIe_G and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations compared to process-oriented AOIp_G. Therefore, with continuous NO<sub>x</sub> abatement, AOIe_G should be considered to represent actual AOC, also O<sub>3</sub>-inducing ability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
