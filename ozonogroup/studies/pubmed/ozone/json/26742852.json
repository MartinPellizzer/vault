Several computer-based tools help automate air pollution health impact assessments and are being used for a variety of contexts. Expanding information gathered for a May 2014 World Health Organization expert meeting, we survey 12 multinational air pollution health impact assessment tools, categorize them according to key technical and operational characteristics, and identify limitations and challenges. Key characteristics include spatial resolution, pollutants and health effect outcomes evaluated, and method for characterizing population exposure, as well as tool format, accessibility, complexity, and degree of peer review and application in policy contexts. While many of the tools use common data sources for concentration-response associations, population, and baseline mortality rates, they vary in the exposure information source, format, and degree of technical complexity. We find that there is an important tradeoff between technical refinement and accessibility for a broad range of applications. Analysts should apply tools that provide the appropriate geographic scope, resolution, and maximum degree of technical rigor for the intended assessment, within resources constraints. A systematic intercomparison of the tools' inputs, assumptions, calculations, and results would be helpful to determine the appropriateness of each for different types of assessment. Future work would benefit from accounting for multiple uncertainty sources and integrating ambient air pollution health impact assessment tools with those addressing other related health risks (e.g., smoking, indoor pollution, climate change, vehicle accidents, physical activity)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Society for Risk Analysis."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Analytics, LLC, Washington, DC, USA. susan.anenberg@envhealthanalytics.com."}], "LastName": "Anenberg", "ForeName": "Susan C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abt Associates, Bethesda, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Belova", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University, Roskilde, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Brandt", "ForeName": "J\u00f8rgen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Fann", "ForeName": "Neal", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Greco", "ForeName": "Sue", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, USA."}], "LastName": "Guttikunda", "ForeName": "Sarath", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, Bonn, Germany."}], "LastName": "Heroux", "ForeName": "Marie-Eve", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, UK."}], "LastName": "Hurley", "ForeName": "Fintan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Group, King's College London, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Krzyzanowski", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "French Institute for Public Health Surveillance, Saint Maurice, France."}], "LastName": "Medina", "ForeName": "Sylvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, UK."}], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The World Bank, Washington, DC, USA."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Energy Economics and Rational Use of Energy, University Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany."}], "LastName": "Roos", "ForeName": "Joachim", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES), Ispra, VA, Italy."}], "LastName": "Van Dingenen", "ForeName": "Rita", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "001", "Acronym": "WHO_", "Agency": "World Health Organization", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Risk Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8109978", "ISSNLinking": "0272-4332"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26742852", "10.1111/risa.12540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
