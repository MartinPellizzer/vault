However, few studies have evaluated the effects of the present air pollution on the health of Chinese children. This study examines the association between outdoor and indoor air pollution and respiratory diseases among children living in Liaoning, a heavy industrial province of China.", "A cross-sectional study of 23,326 Chinese children aged 6 to 13 years was conducted in 25 districts of 7 cities in Northeast China during 2009. Three-year (2006-2008) average concentrations of particles with an aerodynamic diameter of \u226410 \u03bcm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), and ozone (O3) were calculated from monitoring stations in each of the 25 districts. We used two-level logistic regression models to examine the effects of yearly variations in exposure to each pollutant, controlling for important covariates.", "The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was higher for those dwelling close to a busy road, those living near smokestacks or factories, those living with smokers, those living in one-story houses typically with small yards, and those with home renovation, bedroom carpet or pets. Ventilation device use was associated with decreased odds of asthma in children. The adjusted odds ratio for diagnosed-asthma was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.45) per 31 \u03bcg/m(3) increase in PM10, 1.23 (95%CI, 1.14-1.32) per 21 \u03bcg/m(3) increase in SO2, 1.25 (95%CI, 1.16-1.36) per 10 \u03bcg/m(3) increase in NO2, and 1.31 (95%CI, 1.21-1.41) per 23 \u03bcg/m(3) increase in O3, respectively.", "Outdoor and indoor air pollution was associated with an increased likelihood of respiratory morbidity among Chinese children."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
