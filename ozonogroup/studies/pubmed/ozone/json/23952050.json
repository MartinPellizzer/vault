This process relies on the formation of hydroxyl radicals through the VUV-induced photolysis of water. In particular, the use of ozone-generating mercury vapor lamps, which emit 10% of the radiation at 185\u00a0nm and 90% at 254\u00a0nm, is showing very promising results for the degradation of micropollutants. The kinetics of VUV process has been studied in batch- and flow-through reactors, but the effect of 254 and 185\u00a0nm photons cannot be isolated, mass transfer resistances can take place and the interpretation of the results is complex. In this technical note, a new VUV collimated beam to conduct kinetic tests is presented, which offers several advantages: (1) it allows the irradiation of samples with 185, 254\u00a0nm photons, or both, (2) the concentration of reagents is uniform in the reaction volume and (3) it allows to change the fluence rate by changing the distance between the lamp and the photoreactor. Details of the geometry are presented, as well as an analysis of the collimation and uniformity of the radiation of the new VUV-collimated beam setup."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 The American Society of Photobiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duca", "ForeName": "Clara", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imoberdorf", "ForeName": "Gustavo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohseni", "ForeName": "Madjid", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "NSERC", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23952050", "10.1111/php.12157"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
