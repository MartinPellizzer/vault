LSS usually happens in older people who do not have the proper physical condition to undergo surgery. Therefore, minimally invasive methods such as Ozone therapy and epidural injection can be used in these patients.", "The objective this study was to compare the effect of caudal epidural steroid-hyaluronidase injection with paravertebral intramuscular Ozone injection on reducing pain in patients with LSS.", "A total of 30 patients suffering from LSS randomized to two groups. Group A (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200915) received three paravertebral intramuscular infiltrations of the Ozone, Group B (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200915) received a caudal epidural injection of steroid-hyaluronidase. The effects of the interventions were evaluated by measuring Visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability index (ODI), Quebec Back Pain Disability (QBPDS) and Roland Morris low back pain questionnaire (RMQ) before the interventions and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the interventions.", "Within-group changes showed significant improvement in VAS, ODI, RMQ, and QBPDS scores in both groups from pre-treatment to end of follow-up (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The mean VAS score at all follow-up had significant differences between the two groups (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01).
