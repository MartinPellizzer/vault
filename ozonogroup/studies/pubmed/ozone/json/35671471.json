Concentrations of PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> were computed as the difference between inhalable and fine PM. A two-stage time-series analytic approach was applied, with overdispersed generalized linear models and multilevel meta-analysis. We fitted two-pollutant models to test the independent effect of PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> from copollutants (fine PM, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide). Exposure-response relationship curves were pooled, and regional analyses were conducted. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> A 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> concentration on lag 0-1 day was associated with increments of 0.51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18%-0.84%), 0.43% (95% CI, 0.15%-0.71%), and 0.41% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.77%) in total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. The associations varied by country and region. These associations were robust to adjustment by all copollutants in two-pollutant models, especially for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The exposure-response curves for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were positive, with steeper slopes at lower exposure ranges and without discernible thresholds. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides novel global evidence on the robust and independent associations between short-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5-10</sub> and total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, suggesting the need to establish a unique guideline or regulatory limit for daily concentrations of PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and National Health Commission Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Cong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and National Health Commission Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and National Health Commission Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Renjie", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Computer Science, and Applications \"G.
