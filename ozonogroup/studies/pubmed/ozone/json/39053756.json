In the present study, Jarvis-type stomatal conductance model was parameterized for ten urban species in northern China. Incorporating the effects of time of day and diurnal O<sub>3</sub> concentration significantly enhanced the model performance. For different plant functional types (greening trees, greening shrubs, and orchard-grown trees), three parameterizations were established to estimate stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake (POD<sub>1</sub>, phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose over an hourly threshold of 1\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The differences in POD<sub>1</sub> between greening trees and shrubs were primarily due to the difference in their stomatal sensitivity to light. Orchard-grown trees displayed the lowest O<sub>3</sub> removal capacity (lowest value of POD<sub>1</sub>) because of their shorter growing season despite of high stomatal conductance. These results indicated that plant phenology and light responsiveness determined stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake, and the three parameterizations developed here could be applicable to various urban species in northern regions. Among climatic factors for O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment, O<sub>3</sub> concentration was the most important factor determining annual variation of POD<sub>1</sub>, which was primarily driven by air temperature. However, when O<sub>3</sub> pollution decreased, O<sub>3</sub> concentration exhibited less dependence on temperature and more dependence on light. These findings provide crucial insights for urban policy-makers and environmental scientists aiming to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution effects and enhance urban vegetation health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
