In this regard, we conducted field measurement on speciated VOC (including OVOC) emissions from six construction machinery and five river ships in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region to identify VOC emission characteristics. We noticed that OVOC emissions from construction machinery and ships accounted for more than 50% of the total VOC emissions, followed by alkenes, aromatics and alkanes. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the most emission species, accounting for 61.8%-83.2% of OVOCs. For construction machinery, the fuel-based emission factors of roller, grader and pile driver were 3.12, 3.12 and 7.36\u00a0g/kg, respectively. With the rigorous restraint by the national emission standards, VOC emissions of construction machinery had decreased considerably, especially during stage \u2162. Ozone formation potential was also significantly reduced due to the significant decrease in emissions of OVOCs and alkenes with higher reactivity. For river ships, the fuel-based emission factors of cargo ships and speedboat were 1.46 and 0.44\u00a0g/kg, respectively. VOC emissions from construction machinery and river ships in Guangdong Province in 2017 were 8851.0 and 4361.0 ton, respectively. This study filled the knowledge gaps of reactive gas emissions from different kinds of non-road mobile sources over the PRD, and more importantly, highlighted the necessity in adding OVOC measurement to give a complete and accurate depiction of reactive gas emissions from non-road mobile sources."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
