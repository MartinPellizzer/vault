Beside the synergistic effects of such process combination, which lead to oxidation of recalcitrant and inhibitory compounds or intermediates by enhancement of their biodegradability, the key for raising applicability is the improvement of the ozonation efficiency. An overview about the history and progress of full-scale applications, which deals with combined ozonation and biological treatment is given. Recently more than 40 applications exist, but many of them are not published. Therefore, a couple of selected not yet published applications have been mentioned in this paper. Landfill leachate and industrial wastewater treatment were mostly applicated, while treatment of municial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are of increasing interest due to several advantages such as disinfection, decolourisation and removal of persistent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for water re-use and groundwater recharge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "WEDECO GmbH, Boschstrasse 6, 32051 Herford, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ried", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mielcke", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wieland", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schaefer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sievers", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17674856", "10.2166/wst.2007.413"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
