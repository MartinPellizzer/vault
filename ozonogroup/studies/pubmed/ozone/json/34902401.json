This effort coincided with the second China International Import Expo (CIIE), during which strict emission controls were implemented in Shanghai, resulting in an average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of less than 35\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. The self-developed instrument based on the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique reported that the average OH radical concentration at noontime (11:00-13:00) was 2.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>-3</sup>, while the HO<sub>2</sub> concentration was 0.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>-3</sup>. A chemical box model utilizing the Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism 2 (RACM2), which is used to simulate pollutant reactions and other processes in the troposphere and which incorporates the Leuven isoprene mechanism (LIM1), reproduced the OH concentrations on most days. The HO<sub>2</sub> concentration was underestimated, and the observed-to-modelled ratio demonstrated poor performance by the model, especially during the elevated photochemistry period. Missing primary peroxy radical sources or unknown behaviors of RO<sub>2</sub> for high-NOx regimes are possible reasons for the discrepancy. The daytime ROx production was controlled by various sources. HONO photolysis accounted for more than one half (0.83\u00a0ppb/h), and the contribution from formaldehyde, OVOCs and ozone photolysis was relatively similar. Active oxidation paths accelerated the rapid ozone increase in winter. The average ozone production rate was 15.1\u00a0ppb/h, which is comparable to that of a Beijing suburb (10\u00a0ppb/h for the 'BEST-ONE') but much lower than that of Beijing's center (39\u00a0ppb/h in 'PKU' and 71\u00a0ppb/h in 'APHH') in wintertime. Cumulative local ozone based on observed peroxy radicals was five times higher than the value simulated by the current model due to the underprediction of HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> under the high-NOx regime. This analysis provides crucial information for subsequent pollution control policies in Shanghai."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
