Due to its high global warming potential and ozone-depleting properties, the nitrous oxide emissions related to health care are being increasingly scrutinized. In this narrative review, we will discuss the clinical uses of nitrous oxide relevant to anesthetists, in addition to its contribution as a greenhouse gas. Using available data from Australia, we will explore potential strategies for reducing the impact of those emissions, which are likely to be applicable in other countries. These include destruction of captured nitrous oxide, minimizing nitrous oxide waste and reducing clinical use. Anesthesia clinicians are well placed to raise awareness with colleagues and consumers regarding the environmental impact of nitrous oxide and to promote cleaner alternatives. Reducing use is likely to be the most promising reduction strategy without large-scale changes to infrastructure and subsequent delay in action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 International Anesthesia Research Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yigang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, Queensland Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Lee-Archer", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Pain and Perioperative Medicine, Western Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sheridan", "ForeName": "Nicole M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Pain and Perioperative Medicine, Western Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Grampians Health, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}], "LastName": "Seglenieks", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia, Pain and Perioperative Medicine, Western Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Intensive Care, Western Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}], "LastName": "McGain", "ForeName": "Forbes", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Eley", "ForeName": "Victoria A", "Initials": "VA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anesth Analg", "NlmUniqueID": "1310650", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2999"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Greenhouse Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Knuf K, Maani CV.
