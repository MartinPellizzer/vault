However, the characteristics of VOCs emitted from CCI along with their environmental consequences are still poorly understood. To pin down this, an intensive field campaign was carried out at a typical CCI city in northwestern China (Yulin) from February 26 to March 7, 2021. Results showed that VOC compositions in Yulin were distinct from those in the megacities of China as well as in the typical oilfields over the world. The concentration of naphthalene (1.6 \u00b1 1.1 ppbv), an important byproduct of CCI, was significantly higher than that in other cities (<0.2 ppbv). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model analysis revealed that the direct contribution of the CCI source for VOC emissions is 8.8 \u00b1 1.8%. More importantly, these VOCs emitted from the CCI can account for 17.9 \u00b1 6.8% of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation potential and 16.9 \u00b1 7.4% of OH reactivity of VOCs, suggesting the significant impacts of the CCI on the air quality and atmospheric oxidizing capacity. During the observation, a rapid increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration after a snowfall was encountered. The changing rate of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the daytime was significantly higher than in its peripheral cities. The increased O<sub>3</sub> formation was partially attributed to the CCI, and this enhancement can be further magnified by snow cover due to the increment of surface albedo. These findings deepen the understanding of the characteristics and air quality impact of VOCs related to the CCI and provide valuable insights for the development of air quality control measures in the region influenced by intensive coal chemical production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
