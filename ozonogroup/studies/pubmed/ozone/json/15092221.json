Limitations to the use of ozone concentration as mass per unit volume are discussed and a correction for temperature and pressure changes is derived. If identical ozone mass concentrations were measured at two sites separated by 2000 m elevation, the ozone flux at the lower site would exceed the flux at the higher site by 4-8% due to temperature and pressure effects on both air volume and ozone deposition velocity. It is recommended that ozone exposures be described in terms of 'flux-corrected' mass concentrations or volumetric mixing ratios when ambient ozone data from sites at different altitudes are to be compared."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Washington, FX-10, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larson", "ForeName": "T V", "Initials": "TV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vong", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comment", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Pollut. 1990;67(2):147-78. doi: 10.1016/0269-7491(90)90080-v", "PMID": "15092220"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092221", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90081-m", "026974919090081M"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
