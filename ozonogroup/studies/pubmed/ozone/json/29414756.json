However, the O<sub>3</sub> by-product from VUV irradiation causes secondary pollution and needs to be overcome. In this study, a multi-functional photocatalyst of Mn/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/ZSM-4 was thus developed by a one-pot hydrothermal method, and then combined with VUV irradiation to eliminate O<sub>3</sub> byproduct as well as enhance toluene degradation via ozone-assisted catalytic oxidation (OZCO). Under VUV irradiation alone, 64% of toluene degradation was occurred but 51\u202fppm of O<sub>3</sub> was residual. In contrast, toluene degradation was enhanced to 96% over the Mn/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/ZSM-4 while residual O<sub>3</sub> was decreased to 4\u202fppm. The enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic PCO and OZCO, as the Mn modification can efficiently enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and trigger the catalytic ozonation simultaneously. The results of electron spin resonance (ESR) confirmed the generation of reactive species such as OH and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> by VUV irradiation and then greatly enhanced after Mn/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/ZSM-4 was added. Moreover, the possible mechanism of toluene degradation was also revealed through monitoring of reaction intermediate. Obviously, the process of Mn/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/ZSM-4 cooperated well with VUV is promising for VOCs degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
