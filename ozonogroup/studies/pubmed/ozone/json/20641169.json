One-half the trees were exposed to elevated O(3) for 6 yrs prior to and during the experiment. Soil-gas sampling wells were placed at 8 and 15 cm and soil CO(2) was sampled during labeling in mid-late August, 2006. In beech, delta(13)CO(2) at both depths decreased approximately 50 h after labeling, reflecting rapid translocation of fixed C to roots and release through respiration. In spruce, label was detected in fine-root tissue, but there was no evidence of label in delta(13)CO(2). The results show that C fixed in the canopy rapidly reaches respiratory pools in beech roots, and suggest that spruce may allocate very little of recently-fixed carbon into root respiration during late summer. A change in carbon allocation belowground due to long-term O(3) exposure was not observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Western Ecology Division, 200 SW 35th St., Corvallis, OR 97333, United States.
