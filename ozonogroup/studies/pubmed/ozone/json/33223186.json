Observations were recorded on three separate occasions from November 2016 up until January 2018. Concentrations of outdoor O3 were monitored throughout the study period. Biomarkers indicative of glucose-homeostasis, including fasting blood glucose, insulin, HbAlc, glycated albumin percentage (glycated albumin/albumin), HOMA-IR and HOMA-B were measured at 3 sessions. A linear mixed effects model with random effects was adopted to quantify the effect of O3 across a comprehensive set of glucose-homeostasis markers.", "Short-term O3 exposure positively associated with increased fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B. The effect on glucose occurred at 3-, 5-, 6- and 7-days, although the largest effect manifested on 6-days (5.6%, 95% CI: 1.4, 9.9). Significant associations with both insulin and HOMA-IR were observed on the 3- and 4-days. For HOMA-B, positive associations were identified from 3- to 7-days with estimates ranging from 40.0% (95% CI: 2.3, 91.5) to 83.1% (95% CI: 25.3, 167.5). Stratification suggests that women may be more susceptible to short-term O3 exposure. There does not appear to be a significant association between O3 and glucose-homeostasis in medium-term exposures.", "In this study, we found that O3 exposure is at least partially associated with type II diabetes in older adults with no prior history of this condition. O3 therefore appears to be a potential risk factor, which is a particular concern when we consider the rise in global concentrations. Evidence also suggests that women may be more susceptible to short-term O3 exposure although we are not quite sure why. Future research may look to investigate this phenomenon further."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
