It harbors abundant and diverse antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigated the removal of ARB and ARGs in a pilot-scale reactor, which consisted of an anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process, anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic process, and ozone-based disinfection to treat 1\u00a0m<sup>3</sup>/day wastewater from an electric multiple unit high-speed train. Further, the high prevalence of two mobile genetic elements (intI1 and Tn916/615) and five ARGs (tetA, tetG, qnrA, qnrS, bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>, and ermF) was investigated using quantitative PCR. Significant positive correlations between ARGs (tetA, bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>, and qnrA) and intI1 were identified (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.94, 0.85, and 0.70, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Biological treatment could significantly reduce Tn916/1545 (2.57 logs reduction) and Enterococci (2.56 logs reduction of colony forming unit (CFU)/mL), but the qnrS abundance increased (1.19 logs increase). Ozonation disinfection could further significantly decrease ARGs and Enterococci in wastewater, with a reduction of 1.67-2.49 logs and 3.16 logs CFU/mL, respectively. Moreover, food-related bacteria families which may contain opportunistic or parasitic pathogens (e.g., Moraxellaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae) were detected frequently. Enterococci filtered in this study shows multi-antibiotic resistance. Our study highlights the significance to mitigate antibiotic resistance from wastewater generated from high-speed railway trains, as a mobile source."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
