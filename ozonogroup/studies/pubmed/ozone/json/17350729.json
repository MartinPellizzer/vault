Norovirus was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) assay, and FCV by a combination of QRT-PCR and virus infectivity assays. We were able to reduce the concentration of infectious FCV by a factor of more than 10(3), and in some cases beyond detection, under optimal conditions of ozone exposure with less than an hour of total operation. QRT-PCR assays indicated similar decreases in both viral RNAs. Virus-containing samples dried onto hard surfaces (plastic, steel and glass), and soft surfaces such as fabric, cotton and carpet, were equally vulnerable to the treatment. Our results show that Norovirus can be inactivated by exposure to ozone gas from a portable commercial generator in settings such as hotel rooms, cruise ship cabins and healthcare facilities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Viroforce Systems Inc.
