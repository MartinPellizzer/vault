Unlike Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which strongly relied on adsorption and was significantly influenced by MFO<sub>x</sub> loading, synergistic catalytical effects of MFO<sub>x</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> were observed, and optimal MFO<sub>x</sub> doping of 2 wt% and MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> dosage of 500 ppm were obtained for catalyzing ozonation. In ibuprofen (IBP) degradation, MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub>-catalyzed ozonation (MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>) obtained 2.0-, 4.7- and 6.9-folds the k<sub>obs</sub> of TiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, MFO<sub>x</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> and bare ozonation (B/O<sub>3</sub>). Stronger O<sub>3</sub> decomposition was observed by MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> over bare TiO<sub>2</sub> with the participation of redox pairs Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Mn(II)/Mn(III)/Mn(IV) and increased surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs) from 9.8 % to 33.7 % was detected. The results revealed that Fe(II), Mn(II) and Mn(III) with low valance accelerated Ti(III) generation from Ti(VI), obtaining an unprecedented high Ti(III) composition occupying 35.3 % of the total Ti atoms. Ti(III) catalyzed the direct reduction of SOVs-O<sub>2</sub> to \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and it accelerated the formation of Ti(VI)-OH and Ti(VI)-O which catalyzed O<sub>3</sub> decomposition into \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> was found to primarily initiate IBP degradation with nucleophilic addition and dominated over 66 % IBP removal. The enhanced \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation further strengthened \u2022OH and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production. MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> obtained 17 %, 21 % and 30 % higher TOC removal over TiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, MFO<sub>x</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> and B/O<sub>3</sub>, respectively. Acute toxicity tests confirmed the effective toxicity control of organics by MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> process (inhibition rate: 10.9 %). Degradation test of atenolol and sulfamethoxazole confirmed the catalytic effects of MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub>. MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> performed strong resistance to water matrix in application test and showed good stability and reusability. The study proposed an effective catalyst for strengthening the ozonation process on PPCPs degradation and provided an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms and characteristics of the MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst and MFO<sub>x</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
