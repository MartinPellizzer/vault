Regioisomeric glutathione conjugates derived from intermediate epoxides were measured by HPLC. Compared with FA, rates of glutathione conjugate formation in distal lung (including the central acinus) were elevated 2-fold in O(3)-exposed rats. Activity for cytochrome P450 2B, the isozyme thought to be responsible for the metabolic activation of 1-NN, was increased 3-fold in the distal lung of O(3)- compared with FA-exposed rats. There was a 2 +/- 0. 5-fold increase in immunodetectable CYP 2B protein in microsomes from the same lung subcompartment (P <.05). Immunodetectable protein was expressed in nonciliated epithelial (or \"Clara\") cells and not associated with ciliated epithelial cells. No differences between O(3)- and FA-exposed rats were noted in 1-NN metabolism or CYP 2B activity in trachea or intrapulmonary airways. This study emphasizes that cellular and biochemical alterations associated with long-term O(3) exposure vary considerably by location within the lung. Long-term exposure to O(3) elevates both CYP 2B activity and 1-NN metabolism in an airway-specific manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Cell Biology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA. rcpaige@ucdavis.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paige", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Royce", "ForeName": "F H", "Initials": "FH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buckpitt", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES04311", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES09681", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32ES07059", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A51NP1DL2T", "NameOfSubstance": "1-nitronaphthalene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.2.4", "NameOfSubstance": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11082426"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
