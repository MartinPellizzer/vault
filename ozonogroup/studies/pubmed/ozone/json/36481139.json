The aim of the present study was to elucidate if mineral nutrition is also impaired by chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure. For this purpose, date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) plants were fumigated with ambient, 1.5 \u00d7 ambient and 2 \u00d7 ambient O<sub>3</sub> in a free air controlled exposure (FACE) system for one growing season and concentrations of major nutrients were analyzed in leaves and roots. In addition, concentrations of C and N and their partitioning between different metabolic C and N pools were determined in both organs. The results showed that calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) acquisition by roots was diminished by O<sub>3</sub> exposure of the shoot. For Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn reduced uptake by the roots was combined with reduced allocation to the shoot, resulting in a decline of foliar concentrations; for Na and K, allocation to the shoot was maintained at the expense of the roots. Thus, elevated O<sub>3</sub> impaired both mineral uptake by the roots and partitioning of minerals between roots and shoots, but in an element specific way. Thereby, elevated O<sub>3</sub> affected roots and shoots differently already after one growing season. However, considerable changes in total C and N concentrations and their partitioning between different metabolic pools upon chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure were not observed in either leaves or roots, except for reduced foliar lignin concentrations at 2 \u00d7 ambient O<sub>3</sub>. Significant differences in these parameters were shown between leaves and roots independent of O<sub>3</sub> application. The physiological consequences of the effects of chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure on mineral acquisition and partitioning between leaves and roots are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
