The pollution present indoor is due to multiple sources like electronic and electrical equipment, clothes, furniture and other anthropogenic activity. The concentration of these pollutants changes with time and depends mainly on source type (continuous/intermittent), time of the operation and release/ventilation/wind velocity/pollutant dispersion and anthropogenic activity. It has been observed that equipment like printers, printing machines, photocopiers, etc., releases several pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), semi-volatile organic compounds, benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), toluene and suspended particulate matter during operation. This work represents the emissions of VOCs, benzene, and toluene during photocopy. The numerical validation of results was done using Fluent, which is an application-based software which helps in physical modeling describing air flow and effect of multiple parameter on it like temperature and no of printing/photocopy (in proposed experiment) with respect to time. It has been observed from the results that the emissions of VOCs, benzene, and toluene increase from 0.09 to 1.13\u00a0PPM, 0.17 to 1.87\u00a0PPM and 30 to 235\u00a0PPM, respectively, as the operating duration, temperature (35-40\u00a0\u00b0C) and rate of printing/photocopying increase (120-200/h), and it is because printer/photocopy machine uses heat and pressure to fix an image on the paper surface which subsequently result in higher emission. Multiple adverse health, safety and environmental impacts due to operation of photocopy/printing call for in-depth study, guidance, and monitoring of the workers occupationally associated with this operation for their well-being."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8250-4549"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India. abhisheknandan24@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Nandan", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Nihal Anwar", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Pankaj", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Geochem Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8903118", "ISSNLinking": "0269-4042"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copying Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32405897", "10.1007/s10653-020-00589-0", "10.1007/s10653-020-00589-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
