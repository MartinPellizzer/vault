Between April and June of 2004 or 2005, three measurements were made in each participant of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasminogen activator fibrinogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in plasma, and heart rate variability (HRV). Gaseous air pollutants were measured at one air-monitoring station inside their campus, and particulate air pollutants were measured at one particulate matter supersite monitoring station 1 km from their campus. We used linear mixed-effects models to associate biological endpoints with individual air pollutants averaged over 1- to 3-day periods before measurements were performed.", "We found that increases in hs-CRP, 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and decreases in HRV indices were associated with increases in levels of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 microm and 2.5 microm, sulfate, nitrate, and ozone (O(3)) in single-pollutant models. The increase in 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and the reduction in HRV remained significantly associated with 3-day averaged sulfate and O(3) levels in two-pollutant models. There were moderate correlations (r = -0.3) between blood markers of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and HRV indices.", "Urban air pollution is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, blood coagulation and autonomic dysfunction simultaneously in healthy young humans, with sulfate and O(3) as two major traffic-related pollutants contributing to such effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public Health, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chuang", "ForeName": "Kai-Jen", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Chang-Chuan", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Ta-Chen", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Chung-Te", "Initials": "CT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Chin-Sheng", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "88847-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9001-32-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.68", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G9481N71RO", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyguanosine"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 Aug 15;176(4):325-6. doi: 10.1164/rccm.200705-647ED", "PMID": "17675451"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17463411", "10.1164/rccm.200611-1627OC", "200611-1627OC"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
