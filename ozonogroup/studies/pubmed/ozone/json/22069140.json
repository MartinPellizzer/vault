In the present study, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the emission from five low to medium-throughput laser printers were investigated with respect to the release of ozone (O(3) ), volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter (PM), and submicrometer particles (SMP) during standby and operation. Experiments were conducted in a 1 m(3) emission chamber connected to a Vitrocell\u00ae exposure system. Cytotoxicity was determined by the WST-1 assay and genotoxicity by the micronucleus test in human A549 lung cells. The five laser printers emitted varying but generally small amounts of O(3) , VOC, and PM. VOC emissions included 13 compounds with total VOC concentrations ranging from 95 to 280 \u03bcg/m(3) (e.g., 2-butanone, hexanal, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene). Mean PM concentrations were below 2.4 \u03bcg/m(3). SMP number concentration levels during standby ranged from 9 to 26 particles/cm(3). However, three of the printers generated a 90 to 16 \u00d7 10(3) -fold increase of SMP during the printing process (maximum 294,460 particles/cm(3)). Whereas none of the printer emissions were found to cause cytotoxicity, emissions from two printers induced formation of micronuclei (P < 0.001), thus providing evidence for genotoxicity. As yet, differences in biological activity cannot be explained on the basis of the specific emission characteristics of the different printers. Because laser printing technology is widely used, studies with additional cytogenetic endpoints are necessary to confirm the DNA-damaging potency and to identify emission components responsible for genotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Freiburg University Medical Center, Institut f\u00fcr Umweltmedizin und Krankenhaushygiene, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gminski", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00f6ncz\u00f6l", "ForeName": "Mathias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Modest", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Armbruster", "ForeName": "Benedikt", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mersch-Sundermann", "ForeName": "Volker", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Peripherals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Printing"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22069140", "10.1002/em.20695"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
