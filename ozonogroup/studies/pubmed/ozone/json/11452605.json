The present study examines the effect of ozone on a subset of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in tobacco smoke. The decays of these compounds were measured in a static room-sized chamber: (1) in the absence of ozone, (2) in the presence of moderate ozone concentrations (< 0.115 ppm), and (3) in the presence of high ozone concentrations (< 1.4 ppm). At moderate ozone concentrations there was little effect on the monitored VOCs. At high ozone concentrations there was a small, unanticipated reduction in the concentration of some of the saturated VOCs, apparently caused by OH radicals produced as a consequence of the ozone/alkene reactions. There was also a much larger reduction in the concentrations of those compounds with unsaturated carbon bonds. However, this reduction was largely matched by an increase in the concentration of a number of aldehydes. Some of these aldehydes are more potent irritants than their precursors. Furthermore, even a relatively small ventilation rate (approximately 0.1 h-1) would produce a greater reduction in the monitored VOCs than that produced by a moderate amount of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Tulsa, 600 S.
