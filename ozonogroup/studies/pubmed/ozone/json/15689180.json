Treatments involved placing filters on frames over potted plants that reduced levels of biologically effective UV-B either by 83% (reduced UV-B) or by 12% (near-ambient UV-B) over the 63 day experiment (7 November 1998-8 January 1999) when ozone depletion averaged 17%. Plants growing under near-ambient UV-B had 41% and 40% lower relative growth rates and net assimilation rates, respectively, than those under reduced UV-B. The former plants produced 50% less total biomass as a result of having 47% less aboveground biomass. The reduction in aboveground biomass was a result of a 29% lower leaf elongation rate resulting in shorter leaves and 59% less total leaf area in plants grown under reduced UV-B. p-Coumaric, caffeic and ferulic acids were the major hydroxycinnamic acids, and luteolin derivatives were the major flavonoids in both insoluble and soluble leaf extracts. Concentrations of insoluble p-coumaric and caffeic acid and soluble ferulic acids were 38%, 48% and 60% higher, respectively, under near-ambient UV-B than under reduced UV-B. There were no UV-B effects on concentrations of insoluble or soluble flavonoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, TS-242 Trafton Sciences Center, Minnesota State University, Mankato, MN, USA. christopher.ruhland@mnsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruhland", "ForeName": "Christopher T", "Initials": "CT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Fusheng S", "Initials": "FS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "W Dennis", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Day", "ForeName": "Thomas A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15689180", "10.1562/2004-09-18-RA-321", "2004-09-18-RA-321"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
