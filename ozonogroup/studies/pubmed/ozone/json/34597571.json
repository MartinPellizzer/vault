Previous studies have mainly focused on inflammatory processes and metabolic diseases caused by acute or chronic ozone exposure. However, the effect of ozone on lipid expression profiles remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the lipidomic changes in lung tissue and serum of rats after ozone exposure for three months and explore the lipid metabolic pathway involved in an ozone-induced injury. Based on the non-targeted lipidomic analysis platform of the UPLC Orbitrap mass spectrometry system, we found that sub-chronic exposure to ozone significantly changed the characteristics of lipid metabolism in lungs and serum of rats. First, the variation in sphingomyelin (SM) and triglyceride (TG) levels in the lung and serum after O<sub>3</sub> exposure are shown. SM decreased in both tissues, while TG decreased in the lungs and increased in the serum. Further, the effect of ozone on glycerophospholipids in the lung and serum was completely different. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were the major glycerophospholipids whose levels were altered in the lung, while phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels changed dramatically in the serum. Third, after O<sub>3</sub> exposure, the level of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), mainly MGDG (43, 11), a saccharolipid, declined significantly and uniquely in the serum. These results suggested that sub-chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure may play a role in the development of several diseases through perturbation of lipidomic profiles in the lungs and blood. In addition, changes in the lipids of the lung and blood may induce or exacerbate respiratory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
