Data on how and when children may be at risk are vital for accomplishing this goal. Recent examples of the link between research and policy include U.S. EPA actions to carry out the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences on pesticides in children's food, reduce and prevent childhood lead poisoning, and revise national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. Today, the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), which makes protecting children from pesticide residues in food a national priority, is contributing to the growing need for data for decision making. Further impetus comes from provisions in the FQPA and 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments for establishing a screening and testing program for potential risks from endocrine disruptors. Another factor is the analysis that will be required under President William J. Clinton's executive order directing all federal agencies, for the first time, to reduce environmental health and safety risks to children. Success of the U.S. international commitment to protect children is directly tied to the strength and availability of environmental data. To meet such challenges, the U.S. EPA is revising key science policies, expanding research opportunities, and adding to the public's right-to-know tools. In this dynamic climate, there are growing opportunities for the research community to play a greater role in helping ensure the well-being of children living today and in generations to come."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460, USA. goldman.lynn@epamail.epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldman", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Welfare"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Priorities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Policy Making"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9646049", "PMC1533059", "10.1289/ehp.98106857"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
