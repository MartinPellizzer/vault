Three aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs; toluene, p-xylene, and styrene) and aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) were chosen as model organic gases for the degradation experiment. Under UV(365) irradiation, toluene was decomposed by a photocatalytic reaction on the surface of mist particles. Under UV(254+185) irradiation, the removal efficiency and mineralization ratio of the VOC gases were higher than those under UV(365) or UV(254) irradiation. Under UV(254+185) irradiation, it was found that VOC gases were immediately degraded and converted to water-soluble intermediates by not only direct photolysis but also oxidation by OH radical, since the removal efficiency of several organic gases depended on the reaction rate with OH radical and the primary effect of generated ozone was to complete the mineralization of the intermediates. On the other hand, water-soluble aldehyde gases were rapidly trapped by mist particles before reaction on their surface. Furthermore, water-soluble intermediates that formed via the decomposition of VOC gases were completely trapped in the mist and were not detected at the reactor exit. Therefore, notable secondary particle generation was not observed, even under UV(254+185) irradiation. Based on these results as well as the size distribution of the mist droplets, it was found that primarily submicron-scale droplets contributed to the photocatalytic reaction. Lastly, we propose a mechanism for the degradation of organic gaseous pollutants on the surface of mist particles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
