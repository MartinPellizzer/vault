However, comparability of these two routes has not been well documented. Thus guinea pig airway responsiveness to ACh and histamine was evaluated 16-18 h after O(3) (3 parts/million, 1 h) or air exposure by two plethysmographic methods (spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated) and by two administration routes (inhalatory or intravenous). We found that O(3) caused airway hyperresponsiveness to intravenous, but not to inhaled, agonists, independent of the plethysmographic method used. Suitability of the inhalatory route to detect airway hyperresponsiveness was corroborated with inhaled ACh after an antigen challenge or extending O(3) exposure to 3 h. Acetylcholinesterase activity was not modified after O(3) exposure in lung homogenates and blood samples. Thus inhaled agonists were less effective to reveal the airway hyperresponsiveness after an acute O(3) exposure than intravenous ones, at least for the 1-h exposure to 3 parts/million, and this difference seems not to be related to an O(3)-induced inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Investigaci\u00f3n en Asma, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Tlalpan 4502, CP 124080, M\u00e9xico DF, M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sommer", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chavez", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carbajal", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Segura", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monta\u00f1o", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstrictor Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11717224", "10.1152/jappl.2001.91.6.2595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
