Individual leaves also were exposed to ozone partial pressures of 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 micropascals per pascal for 5 hours. No visual ozone damage was found on leaves exposed to any of the treatments. Chronic exposure to ambient O(3) partial pressures reduced net CO(2) assimilation rate (A) between 5 and 13% at various times throughout the season when compared to the filtered treatment. Exposure of leaves to 0.2 micropascals per pascal O(3) for 5 hours had no significant effect on A; however, A was reduced 84% for leaves exposed to 0.6 micropascals per pascal O(3) when compared to the controls after 5 hours. Intercellular CO(2) partial pressure (c(i)) was lower for leaves exposed to 0.2 micropascals per pascal O(3) when compared to the controls, while c(i) of the leaves treated with 0.6 micropascals per pascal of 0(3) increased during the fumigation. The long-term effects of ambient O(3) and short-term exposure to acute levels of O(3) reduced grape leaf photosynthesis due to a reduction in both stomatal and mesophyll conductances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Viticulture and Enology, University of California, Davis, California 93648."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roper", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1986 Oct;82(2):401-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16665041"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Oct;73(2):291-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16663210"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Sep;88(1):115-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16666249"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Apr;89(4):1136-40", "ArticleIdList": ["16666676"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Sep;88(1):218-23", "ArticleIdList": ["16666270"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Mar;67(3):539-44", "ArticleIdList": ["16661710"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16667208", "PMC1062213", "10.1104/pp.91.4.1501"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
