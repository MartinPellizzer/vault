In this study, the role of relative humidity (RH) on SOA formation with different [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub>/[cyclohexene]<sub>0</sub> was investigated in a smog chamber. It was found that the cyclohexene SOA yield increases with increasing initial OH concentration at both high and low RH conditions. The increased rate of SOA formation was lower at wet conditions than that at dry conditions. For [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub>/[cyclohexene]<sub>0</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.4 and 0.8, the SOA yield increased from 1.5% to 8% at dry condition to 7% and 12% at wet condition, respectively. In contrast, at high RH the SOA yield fell from 54% to 52% for [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub>/[cyclohexene]<sub>0</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.3. The SOA mass loss was higher at high RH at the same OH exposure. The chemical composition of SOA was characterized using hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS). Oligomers, which were responsible for the increase of the SOA yield, were detected in the SOA formed at high RH conditions. The esterification reaction between dicarboxylic acids and HOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>-O-O-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>OH was the pathway of oligomers formation. All the oligomers have cyclic molecular structures. For [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub>/[cyclohexene]<sub>0</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.3, the relative intensity of both low and high molecular weight substances reduced more at wet conditions. This indicates that at sufficient OH level, the inhibition of oligomers formation and the further reaction of SOA with OH result in a slightly lower SOA yield at wet condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
