Furthermore the importance of testicular toxicity has been realized since the problem of endocrine disruptors arose all over the world, but manual methods must rely on subjective assessment. Recently, computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) was proposed but this system requires vast investment. We then investigated the applicability of the MTT method with a microplate and sperm quality analyzer (SQA) as simple, rapid, and economic instrumental methods for the examination of sperm quality in rats, comparing it with the manual microscopic method and CASA. Epididymal fluid derived from male F344/N Slc (Fischer) rats intraperitoneally injected with 2BP in the dose range of 125-1,000 mg/kg/d twice a week (total 8 times) were examined by these methods as a model experiment. Sperm count measured by the manual method and CASA in the epididymal fluid, absorbance by the MTT method and sperm motility index value by the SQA method were significantly lower in the 2BP 1,000 mg/kg administered group than in the control group. This result suggests that the MTT method can detect oligospermia. With the microplate and microplate reader, the efficiency of detection becomes much better. Sperm analyses by the MTT method with the microplate reader and the SQA method are available for reproductive toxicity study in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Industrial Health, Independent Administrative Institution, 6-21-1, Nagao, Tama-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 214-8585, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohtani", "ForeName": "Katsumi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamazaki", "ForeName": "Shigeru", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubota", "ForeName": "Hisayo", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyagawa", "ForeName": "Muneyuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saegusa", "ForeName": "Junzo", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "2985065R", "ISSNLinking": "0019-8366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R651XOV97Z", "NameOfSubstance": "2-bromopropane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15128172", "10.2486/indhealth.42.219"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
