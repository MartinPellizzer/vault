Qinghai province, situated on the northeast of the QTP, had fewer human activities compared to eastern China, while ozone pollution worsened over the years. To better capture recent emission trends and improve the accuracy of O<sub>3</sub> simulation in Qinghai, this study proposed a top-down method, which combined the air quality modeling system RAMS-CMAQ, with formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) columns derived from TROPOMI as the constraints to improve the emission estimates of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> in July 2020, respectively. Through a series of sensitivity experiments, better quantified emission estimates of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> were obtained to be 1.33 and 0.34\u00a0Tg/yr, 2.5 and 2.1 times larger than the bottom-up ones. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the top-down method and satellite observations constraints in improving VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> emission estimates, resulting in a reduction in the differences between the observed and modeled HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub> columns to 0.7 and 0.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>15</sup>\u00a0molec/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. As a result, the simulated maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased from 58.9 to 81.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, which were closer to observations (85.4\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) values of hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations changed from -24.7\u00a0% to -2.9\u00a0% and from 29.9\u00a0% to 22.3\u00a0%, respectively. This study showed the potential of top-down estimates to aide in the development of emission scenarios, which were critical for accurately simulating the O<sub>3</sub> pollution and pollution control policy studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
