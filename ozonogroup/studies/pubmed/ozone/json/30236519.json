A large variability in acute O<sub>3</sub>-induced effects has been observed; however, the basis for interindividual differences in susceptibility is unclear. We previously demonstrated a role for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis and glucocorticoid response in acute O<sub>3</sub> toxicity. Glucocorticoids have important anti-inflammatory actions, and have been shown to regulate lung inflammatory responses. We hypothesised that a hyporesponsive HPA axis would be associated with greater O<sub>3</sub>-dependent lung inflammatory signaling. Two genetically-related rat strains with known differences in stress axis reactivity, highly-stress responsive Fischer (F344) and less responsive Lewis (LEW), were exposed for 4\u202fh by nose-only inhalation to clean air or 0.8\u202fppm O<sub>3</sub>, and euthanized immediately after exposure. As expected, baseline (air-exposed) plasma corticosterone was significantly lower in the hypo-stress responsive LEW. Although O<sub>3</sub> exposure increased plasma corticosterone in both strains, corticosterone remained significantly lower in LEW when compared to F334. LEW exhibited greater O<sub>3</sub>-induced inflammatory cytokine/chemokine signaling compared to F344, consistent with the lower corticosterone levels. Since we observed strain-specific differences in inflammatory signaling, we further investigated injury biomarkers (total protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase). Although the hyper-responsive F344 exhibited lower inflammatory signaling in response to O<sub>3</sub> compared with LEW, they had greater levels of lung injury biomarkers. Our results indicate that stress axis variability is associated with differential O<sub>3</sub>-induced lung toxicity. Given the large variability in stress axis reactivity among humans, stress axis regulation could potentially be a determining factor underlying O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2018.
