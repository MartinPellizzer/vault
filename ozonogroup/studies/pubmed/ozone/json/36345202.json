Interview data were analyzed by theme analysis focusing on \"What does the PCP understand about the role of PTs through the experience of working with PTs in hospitals?\" and \"What roles and purposes does the PCP wish for PTs in primary care settings?\"", "PCPs viewed PTs as providers of rehabilitation in the traditional medical model, and understood their role as an occupation having a mono-causal viewpoint, namely a specific and well-defined outcome for individual patients, and intervening with patients within a short clinical course with the aim of improvement or maintenance of the patient's condition. With regard to future primary care, PCPs expected that PTs would interpret various factors related to patient lives from the viewpoint of causal interactions; become important stakeholders in the community; and respond flexibly to patients and the environmental factors around them with continued support to the individual.", "PCPs understood the role of PTs in hospitals as \"Rehabilitation in the traditional medical model,\" and expected the future role of PTs in primary care as \"Rehabilitation in integrated community care.\""]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7315-2959"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan."}], "LastName": "Goto", "ForeName": "Ryohei", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Education Center, School of Medicine, Keio University, Shinjuku ku, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Haruta", "ForeName": "Junji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Sachiko", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Prim Care Community Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101518419", "ISSNLinking": "2150-1319"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Therapists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physicians, Primary Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motivation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Primary Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}], "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aoki T, Yamamoto Y, Ikenoue T, Onishi Y, Fukuhara S.
