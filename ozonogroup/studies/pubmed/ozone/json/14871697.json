Ambient air was used as the control treatment. In the ozone-sensitive clone B, there was an initial stimulation of leaf area growth in response to the ozone treatment, but further ozone exposure caused reductions in leaf and stem biomass growth, Rubisco and chlorophyll a contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency and chloroplast size. It also caused an alteration in chloroplast shape and injury to thylakoid membranes. In the ozone-tolerant clone C, ozone fumigation did not affect growth rate, and there were no consistent changes in chlorophyll content, photosynthesis or water use efficiency. There were also fewer ultrastructural abnormalities in the chloroplasts of clone C than of clone B. Based on the observed biochemical, physiological and structural changes in chloroplasts of clone B in response to low concentrations of ozone, we conclude that the increasing concentration of tropospheric ozone represents a risk to natural birch populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, P.O.
