The SCP degradation and total organic carbon removal indicated that the oxidation efficiency of the peroxide oxidants followed an order of O<sub>3</sub>/MnO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0PMS/MnO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0PDS/MnO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/MnO<sub>2</sub>. In catalytic ozonation, SCP degradation rate constants of different MnO<sub>2</sub> phases followed an order of \u03b4-MnO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub>> \u03b2-MnO<sub>2</sub>. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) suggested that hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) might be more significant for SCP degradation than sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u00b7-</sup>) and superoxide (\u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) radicals. Radical competition experiments demonstrated that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and \u00b7OH contributed to 63.16% and 28.07%, respectively, for the catalytic ozonation of SCP. It was also found that more oxygen vacancies, specific surface area and exposure of MnO<sub>6</sub> edges could facilitate the activation of O<sub>3</sub> for <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and \u00b7OH productions and SCP degradation. The degradation pathways of SCP could mainly follow the cleavage of S-C or S-N bond and dechlorination, accompanied by hydroxylation and oxidation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
