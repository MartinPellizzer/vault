The use of ozone micro-nano bubbles, due to their smaller size compared to traditional macrobubbles, shows potential for efficient penetration into the low-permeability aquifer and effective oxidization of contaminants. This study conducted batch experiments, column studies, and 2D tank experiments to systematically investigate the remediation efficiency of toluene in a heterogeneous aquifer using ozonated water (OW), ozone micro-bubble water (OMBW), and encapsulated ozone micro-nano bubble water (EOMBW) with rhamnolipid. Experimental results showed that rhamnolipid effectively increased the densities and reduced the sizes of micro-nano bubbles, leading to improved ozone preservation and enhanced toluene degradation. Nanobubbles exhibited higher mobility compared to microbubbles in porous media, while rhamnolipid increased the density of penetrated nanobubbles by 9.6 times. EOMBW demonstrated superior efficiency in oxidizing toluene in low-permeability aquifers, and a numerical model was developed to successfully simulate the ozone and toluene concentration. The model revealed that the increased oxidation rate by EOMBW was attributed to the preservation of ozone in micro-nano bubbles and the enhanced toluene oxidation rate. These findings contribute significantly to the application of EOMBW in heterogeneous aquifer remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
