Many studies have been conducted in Thailand to analyze the rice production systems. However, most of the prior work just focused on deterministic approach to investigate the rice production systems while disregarding the system variability. In this study, the conventional and organic rice farming systems in Thailand were compared considering the uncertainties associated with parameters. The system variability was taken into account by employing a stochastic modeling approach. The considered impact categories include global warming, ozone formation (human health), freshwater ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, fine particulate matter formation, freshwater eutrophication, and fossil resource scarcity. The results showed that yield had considerable influence on the environmental profiles of the two systems; organic and conventional farming showed similar results in terms of global warming on a per hectare basis, but the considerable difference was observed on a per tonne basis. The field emissions due to farm inputs were the most significant contributor to most of the impact categories. The fuel used for irrigation, land preparation, and harvesting also contributed significantly to several impact categories. On the other hand, the impacts of inputs production and material transportation were modest. Uncertainty analysis outcomes indicated that there was a noticeable deviation from the deterministic results in terms of global warming and freshwater ecotoxicity. However, when considering the associated uncertainties, no significant difference was observed between the environmental profiles of the two systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
