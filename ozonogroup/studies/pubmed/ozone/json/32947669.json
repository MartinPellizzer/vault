This work proposed a restricted chlorine-dosing strategy for UV/chlorine and post-chlorination under different pH and UV irradiation conditions by comprehensively assessing the oxidation of natural organic matter (NOM), formation of 9 haloacetic acids (HAA9) and bromate, and alteration of toxicity. During UV/chlorine with restricted chlorine doses, the oxidation of NOM chromophores (i.e., \u0394UVA254) showed an apparent dependence on cumulative exposures of free available chlorine (CT<sub>FAC</sub>); Meanwhile, HAA9 formation was determined by CT<sub>FAC</sub> values and could be linearly correlated with \u0394UVA254 irrespective of pH and UV irradiation wavelength. Irradiated by 254\u00a0nm LP-Hg lamp, the faster chlorine photolysis produced relatively higher steady-state concentrations of Cl<sup>\u2022</sup> and HO<sup>\u2022</sup> species but resulted in lower CT<sub>FAC</sub>. Reducing CT<sub>FAC</sub> values by operation parameters (pH, UV wavelength and irradiation fluence) could mitigate HAA9 formation during UV/chlorine at a specific chlorine dose. Additionally, high bromide concentration and acidic pH promoted more bromo-HAAs formation, and the presence of NOM significantly suppressed bromate formation. Analogous to ozonation, the UV/chlorine pre-oxidation could reduce the HAA9 formation potentials during post-chlorination at mildly alkaline pH. The photobacterium bioassay further demonstrated that although the UV/chlorine treatment might have increased the acute toxicity, the post-chlorination treatment could polish the acute toxicity to the level of chlorination alone. These results suggest that with the restricted chlorine-dosing strategy, the trade-off between oxidation/disinfection efficiency and DBPs formation can be controlled by monitoring CT<sub>FAC</sub> and \u0394UVA254 values during UV/chlorine treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
