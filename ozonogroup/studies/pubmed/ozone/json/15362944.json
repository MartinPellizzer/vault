We compared these two approaches by growing lettuce and oat simultaneously under three conditions: UV-B exclusion, near-ambient UV-B (control) and UV-B supplementation (simulating a 30% ozone depletion). This permitted computation of \"solar UV-B\" and \"supplemental UV-B\" effects. Microclimate and photosynthetically active radiation were the same under the two treatments and the control. Excluding UV-B changed total UV-B radiation more than did supplementing UV-B, but the UV-B supplementation contained more \"biologically effective\" shortwave radiation. For oat, solar UV-B had a greater effect than supplemental UV-B on main shoot leaf area and main shoot mass, but supplemental UV-B had a greater effect on leaf and tiller number and UV-B-absorbing compounds. For lettuce, growth and stomatal density generally responded similarly to both solar UV-B and supplemented UV-B radiation, but UV-absorbing compounds responded more to supplemental UV-B, as in oat. Because of the marked spectral differences between the techniques, experiments using UV-B exclusion are most suited to assessing effects of present-day UV-B radiation, whereas UV-B supplementation experiments are most appropriate for addressing the ozone depletion issue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones Fisiol\u00f3gicas y Ecol\u00f3gicas Vinculadas a la Agricultura, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas and Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rousseaux", "ForeName": "M Cecilia", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flint", "ForeName": "Stephan D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Searles", "ForeName": "Peter S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caldwell", "ForeName": "Martyn M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avena"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15362944", "10.1562/2004-03-30-RA-129", "2004-03-30-RA-129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
