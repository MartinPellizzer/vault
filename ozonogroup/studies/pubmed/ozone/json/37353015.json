The machine learning models are widely used to estimate ground-level O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, but the spatial and temporal features in the data are less considered. To address the issue, this study proposed a novel framework named MixNet to estimate daily O<sub>3</sub> concentration from 2020 to 2021 over the Yangtze River Delta. The MixNet utilized image convolution to extract the potential spatial information related to O<sub>3</sub> fully. The temporal features were extracted by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). A U-Net, a new jump connection method with an attention mechanism and residual blocks, facilitated a more comprehensive extraction of spatial features in the data. The extracted temporal and spatial features were fused to estimate ground-level O<sub>3</sub>. Meanwhile, a novel training method was proposed to enhance the accuracy of MixNet. The daily mean O<sub>3</sub> maps have high validation results in comparison with ground-level O<sub>3</sub> measurement, with R<sup>2</sup> (RMSE) of 0.903 (14.511 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for sample-based validation, 0.831 (19.036 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for site-based validation, and 0.712 (25.108 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for time-based validation. The season-average maps indicate that O<sub>3</sub> concentration is summer > autumn > spring > winter. The highest value was 137.41 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the summer of 2021 over the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, and the lowest value was 52.73 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in winter 2020. The MixNet showed better performance compared with other models, and thus the \"point-plane image thinking\" will contribute to future studies in developing better methods to estimate atmospheric pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
