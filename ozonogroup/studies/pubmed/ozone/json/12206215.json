With selected GOME wavelength regions, from clear and cloudy pixels alike plus orbital and instrument data as input, a feed-forward neural network was trained to determine total ozone in a one-step inverse retrieval procedure. To achieve this training, ground-based total ozone measurements from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC) for the years 1996-2000, supplemented with Dobson-corrected Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data to provide global coverage, were collocated with GOME ground pixels into a training data set. Validation of the neural-network-retrieved ozone values relative to independent ground stations yielded a rms error of better than 11 Dobson units. Comparisons performed on the basis of operationally available TOMS and GOME level-3 maps exhibit good agreement in general, with a latitude-dependent offset."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research, Stuttgart, Germany. martin.mueller@zsw-bw.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Martin D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaifel", "ForeName": "Anton", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burrows", "ForeName": "John P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12206215", "10.1364/ao.41.005051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
