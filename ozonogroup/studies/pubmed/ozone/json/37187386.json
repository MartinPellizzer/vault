HN2\u00a0+\u00a026 cities (\"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities of Henan Province) are located in the south of \"2\u00a0+\u00a026\" cities, with frequent and severe ozone pollution events in recent years. This study investigated the diurnal evolution characteristics of ozone formation sensitivity (OFS) of HN2\u00a0+\u00a026 cities from May to September in 2021 by the innovative combination of Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2B) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data, and assessed the impact of ozone pollution control measures (OPCMs) implemented from June 26 to July 1, 2021. The localized FNR (ratio of formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide of satellite measurement) threshold (1.4-2.55) was established, and it was found that OFS in May-September 2021 was mainly in VOCs-limited regime in the morning (\u223c10:00), while transitional/NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime in the afternoon (\u223c14:00). Three periods (before, during and after the OPCMs) were divided to evaluate the impact of OPCMs on OFS. It was indicated that OPCMs had no impact on the morning OFS, but had a significant impact on the afternoon OFS. Specifically, the OFS in two industrial cities Xinxiang (XX) and Zhengzhou (ZZ) shifted from transitional regime to NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime after the OPCMs. We further investigated OFS differences between urban and suburban areas and found that OFS shift of XX only existed in urban areas, while that of ZZ existed in both urban and suburban areas. We compared their measures and found that it is effective to take hierarchical control measures on different levels of ozone pollution days to alleviate ozone pollution. This study provides an improved understanding of diurnal evolution characteristics of OFS and the impacts of OPCMs on it, which will provide a theoretical basis for formulating more scientific ozone pollution control policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
