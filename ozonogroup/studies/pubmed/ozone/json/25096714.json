NBW3 was adjusted to different pH levels (2.0-7.4) and the bactericidal activity on H. pylori was also tested. To examine the cytotoxicity of NBW3, AGS cells, human gastric epithelial cells, were treated with NBW3 and the viability of the cells was evaluated in vitro. Furthermore, NBW3 was administered to mice and gastric mucosal damage was evaluated by histology.", "Pepsin reduced the disinfective activity of NBW3 on H. pylori in a pepsin concentration-dependent manner.
