Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are considered as one of the most promising techniques used for the degradation of VOCs. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) catalytic oxidation system is a typical composite AOPs system involving several processes such as VUV photodegradation, photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), ozone catalytic oxidation (OZCO) and their combinations. VUV based catalytic oxidation processes have been intensively studied for degrading VOCs. This review summarizes the recent studies on the use of VUV catalytic oxidation for degrading VOCs. All the processes involved in VUV catalytic oxidation and their combinations have been reviewed. Studies of VOCs degradation by VUV catalytic oxidation can be generally divided into two aspects: developments of catalysts and mechanistic studies. Principles of different processes, strategies of catalyst development and reaction mechanism are summarized in this review. Two directions of prospective future work were also proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
