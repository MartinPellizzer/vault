Ozone major autohemotherapy (the return of a small amount of a patient's blood to the circulation after ex vivo exposure to ozone) has been reported to have a therapeutic effect in various pathological conditions, including ischemic, infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Ozone has an effect on the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules and acute phase reactants, which are responsible in part for the respiratory inflammatory response observed after exposure to this gas. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of ozone administration ex vivo, at a concentration commonly used in major autohemotherapy, on peripheral blood neutrophil function in vitro. Blood drawn from healthy volunteers was studied for neutrophil adhesion, chemotaxis and O-2 production before and after exposure to 30 microg/ml ozone. There was no significant difference in adhesion and chemotaxis of neutrophils exposed to ozone versus unexposed cells. O-2 production was minimally decreased (20.3 +/- 5.0 vs. 22.1 +/- 5.5 nmol/106 cells/10 min, respectively; P=0.01), a reduction of no clinical significance. This study confirms that major autohemotherapy with ozone is safe as far as neutrophil function is concerned. Combined with previous data, it seems that well-designed clinical trials to assess the efficacy of major autohemotherapy would pose no danger to blood cell populations, and should be encouraged."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gaucher Clinic and the Department of Medicine and Surgery A, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, Hadassah University Hospital (Mount Scopus), Jerusalem, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margalit", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Attias", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Attias", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elstein", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zimran", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matzner", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Lab Haematol", "NlmUniqueID": "7907061", "ISSNLinking": "0141-9854"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11683785", "10.1046/j.1365-2257.2001.00401.x", "401"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
