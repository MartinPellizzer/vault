The N(2)O(5) reacted on ice at 185 K to form condensed-phase nitric acid (HNO(3)). This reaction may provide a sink for odd nitrogen (NO(x)) during the polar winter, a requirement in nearly all models of Antarctic ozone depletion. A lower limit to the sticking coefficient, gamma, for N(2)O(5) on ice is 1 x 10(-3). Moreover, N(2)O(5) reacted on HCl-ice surfaces at 185 K, with gamma greater than 3 x 10(-3). This reaction, which produced gaseous nitryl chloride (ClNO(2)) and condensed-phase HNO(3), proceeded until all of the HCl within the ice was depleted. The ClNO(2), which did not react or condense on ice at 185 K, can be readily photolyzed in the Antarctic spring to form atomic chlorine for catalytic ozone destruction cycles. The other photolysis product, gaseous nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), may be important in the partitioning of NO(x) between gaseous and condensed phases in the Antarctic winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tolbert", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rossi", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Golden", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17731714", "10.1126/science.240.4855.1018", "240/4855/1018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
