Porphyrinurias and porphyrias have been observed after exposure to hexachlorobenzene, chlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenyls, vinyl chloride and lead. Aplastic anemia may occur after exposure to benzene, pesticides, arsenic, cadmium and copper compounds. Megaloblastic anemia has been noted in subjects exposed to arsenic, chlordane, benzene and nitrous oxide. Methemoglobinemia is induced by aromatic nitro and amino compounds. Hemolytic reactions caused by arsenic, methyl chloride, naphthalene, lead, cadmium and mercury compounds represent a separate problem. Immunodeficiencies resulting in decreased antitumor and antiinfectious immunity have been reported in subjects exposed to asbestos, ozone, dimethylsulphoxide, vinilidene chloride, and benzene homologues. Lymphocytopenia may be induced by manganese, lead, toluene and industrial noise. Neutropenia was marked after exposure to carbon disulphide, arsenic compounds, benzene and electromagnetic fields. Only a few reports concern the lymphocyte T3, T4 and T8 subpopulations. Electromagnetic fields (microwaves) cause an imbalance of that subpopulation, consisting of a decrease in the T8 cell count. The neutrophil enzymes, such as myeloperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase, decrease in their activity after exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, carbon disulphide, chlorobenzene and DDT. A majority of agents cited include genotoxic effects reflected in chromosome aberrations and increased sister chromatid exchange and abnormal unscheduled DNA synthesis. Leukemia or lymphoma risk is increased after exposure to pesticides, electromagnetic fields, benzene and irradiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lisiewicz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Folia Med Cracov", "NlmUniqueID": "0374617", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5616"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hematologic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8175062"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
