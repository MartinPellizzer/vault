Elevated ozone rapidly induced premature senescence, with effect increasing in the order: LL<LH<HL<HH. By week 11, the LH and HL treatments had induced similar amounts of whole plant senescence even though the AOT40(12) values (accumulated between 8 am and 8 pm) were very different at 10.6 ppmh and 4.1 ppmh, respectively. Overall, linear correlations between whole plant senescence were stronger for AOT0 than for AOT40. Intraspecific variation in the senescence response to the different profiles was observed after 11 weeks of exposure. Effects on growth and tillering were less pronounced than effects on senescence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Environment Centre Wales, Deiniol Road, Bangor, Gwynedd LL572UW, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dawnay", "ForeName": "Louise", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mills", "ForeName": "Gina", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18980787", "10.1016/j.envpol.2008.09.003", "S0269-7491(08)00461-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
