Airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured by modified Astograph (7 Hz oscillation method) before and after ozone exposure, and TxB2 in plasma and in BALF, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in BALF, numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and differential cell counts in BALF were measured before and after ozone exposure. Ozone exposure was carried out for 2 hr at an ozone level of 3.04 +/- 0.01 ppm (mean +/- SE). There was a significant increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine after ozone exposure in the six dogs (p less than 0.01), and the numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and the neutrophil counts in BALF increased significantly after ozone exposure (P less than 0.01). A selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA-861 significantly inhibited the increase of airway responsiveness to methacholine induced by ozone exposure (p less than 0.05), and furthermore, the increase in the numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and the neutrophil counts in BALF after ozone exposure were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with AA-861 (p less than 0.05). There was no significant change in the levels of TxB2 in plasma or in BALF, and also no apparent change in the levels of histamine was observed in BALF after ozone exposure. The levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in BALF decreased after ozone exposure, but the decrease was not significant. These results suggest that 5-lipoxygenase products play an important role in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and in the infiltration of neutrophils into the airway after ozone exposure in dogs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adachi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Idaira", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konno", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tuzi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Arerugi", "NlmUniqueID": "0241212", "ISSNLinking": "0021-4884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80809-81-0", "NameOfSubstance": "2,3,5-trimethyl-6-(12-hydroxy-5,10-dodecadiynyl)-1,4-benzoquinone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2510702"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
