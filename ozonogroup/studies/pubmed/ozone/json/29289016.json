The purpose of this work was to assess the LuminoTox as a monitoring tool for CEC-associated toxicity in municipal wastewater during ozone treatment, and to evaluate the impact of different ozone feed concentrations at equivalent ozone doses for removing toxicity. The LuminoTox was sensitive at monitoring changes in toxicity of atrazine (ATZ) in synthetic wastewater (SWW) and in a 14 CECs mix in secondary effluent (SE) during ozone treatment. In both experiments, a decrease in toxicity was observed with increasing transferred ozone dose, which corresponded to a decrease in CEC concentration. For ATZ in SWW, a 5\u00a0ppm ozone feed showed better toxicity removal, up to 25% and 35% inhibition for LuminoTox algae biosensors SAPS I and SAPS II, respectively, for statistically equivalent ozone dose pairs of 43\u00a0mg (5\u00a0ppm ozone feed) and 36\u00a0mg (15\u00a0ppm ozone feed). The opposite was true for the 14 CECs in SE; the 15\u00a0ppm ozone feed showed better toxicity removal, up to a reduction of 37% and 40% for SAPS I and SAPS II inhibition, respectively, for statistically equivalent ozone dose pairs of 42\u00a0mg (5\u00a0ppm ozone feed) and 42\u00a0mg (15\u00a0ppm ozone feed). Different feed applications had an impact on the efficiency of toxicity removal for equivalent ozone doses; this efficiency appears to depend on the type of contaminants and/or wastewater matrix."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
