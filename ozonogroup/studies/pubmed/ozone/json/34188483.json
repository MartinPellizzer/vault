We used the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database to obtain the related ED visits and developed statistical models using daily data on ED visits, temperature, relative humidity, and outdoor air pollution concentration levels. The NACRS database contains data on hospital-based and community-based ambulatory care. The environmental data were retrieved from the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) program. The NAPS is the main source of ambient air quality data in Canada. We considered 2 air quality health indexes and 6 air pollutants: daily means of fine particulate matter PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and also maximum 8-hour average ozone. For every air pollutant, we fit 270 models (15 lags\u2009\u00d7\u200918 strata). We found that same-day air pollution concentrations have the highest number of statistically significantly positive associations with ED visits for genitourinary health outcomes. A total of 133 positive associations were identified over the 14\u2009days lag. In subgroup (strata) analysis, females older than 60\u2009years of age were found to have the most positive associations. In particular, nitrogen dioxide was found to be highly associated with ED visits for females over 60; an increase in NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with an increased relative risk (RR) of ED visits when lagged over 0, 1, and 2\u2009days (RR\u2009=\u20091.040 [95% confidence interval: 1.028, 1.052], 1.020 [1.009, 1.032], and 1.025 [1.013, 1.036], respectively). The values of risks are reported for a 1 interquartile range increase in concentration (8.8\u2009ppb). Our results suggest that urban ambient air pollution affect the number of ED visits due to genitourinary system conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7022-3267"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Szyszkowicz", "ForeName": "Mieczys\u0142aw", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Schoen", "ForeName": "Stephanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Program, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "de Angelis", "ForeName": "Nicholas", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Insights", "NlmUniqueID": "101488505", "ISSNLinking": "1178-6302"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Burbank AJ, Peden DB.
