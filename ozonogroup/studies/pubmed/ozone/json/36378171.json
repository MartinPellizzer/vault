Microbubbles (MBs) are tiny gas bubbles with diameters in the micrometre range of 10-100 \u03bcm. Along with their small size, they share special characteristics like slow buoyancy, large gas-liquid interfacial area and high mass-transfer efficiency. Initially, the review examines the key dissimilarities among the different types of microbubble generators (MBG) towards economic large-scale production of MBs. The applications of MBs to explore their effectiveness at different stages of wastewater treatment extending from aeration, separation/ flotation, ozonation, disinfection and other processes are investigated. A summary of the recent advances of MBs in real and synthetic wastewater treatment, existing research gaps, and limitations in upscaling of the technology, conclusion and future recommendations is detailed. A critical analysis of the energetics and treatment cost of combined approaches of MB technology with other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is carried out highlighting the potential applicability of hybrid technology in large-scale wastewater treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Computing, Engineering and Digital Technologies, Teesside University, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, United Kingdom E-mail: S.Nair@tees.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Sarita S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Computing, Engineering and Digital Technologies, Teesside University, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, United Kingdom E-mail: S.Nair@tees.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Pinedo-Cuenca", "ForeName": "Ruben", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veolia Water Technologies, Billingham, England, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Stubbs", "ForeName": "Tony", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, United Kingdom; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology, School of Life Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China."}], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Seth J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ganesan", "ForeName": "Poo Balan", "Initials": "PB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Computing, Engineering and Digital Technologies, Teesside University, Middlesbrough TS1 3BX, United Kingdom E-mail: S.Nair@tees.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Hamad", "ForeName": "Faik", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbubbles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36378171", "10.2166/wst.2022.328"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
