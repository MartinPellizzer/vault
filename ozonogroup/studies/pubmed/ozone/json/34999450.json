Results showed that ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) were the main ROS/RNS, both of which were in a few mg/m<sup>3</sup> to tens mg/m<sup>3</sup>. Increased peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) level indicated CPTA promoted lipid oxidation in samples. The contents of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in samples after CPTA exposure were decreased significantly. Volatile analysis by headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) showed that CPTA exposure promoted the formation of characteristic volatile flavor compounds in dry-cured black carp via facilitating the oxidation of UFA.
