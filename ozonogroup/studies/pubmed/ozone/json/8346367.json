This study began in the first half of 1989; during this period there were 701 cases of acute asthma recorded within the Paris city boundary by \"SOS M\u00e9decins\". The pollutants recorded were sulphur dioxide (SO2), an index of black smoke (FN), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), ozone (O3) and soluble sulphate particles (SO4). In addition, the weather patterns were examined and pollen counts were recorded. In spite of a sub-acute episode of pollution in January and February, there was no definite increase noted in the number of emergency calls made for acute asthma. In the first three months, the number of crises were, on average, higher in association with high levels of the principal pollutants (SO2 FN, NOx, SO4) as well as with the periods of high atmospheric pressure; however, only the sulphate content and atmospheric pressure remained correlated with the daily number of asthmatic crises. In the second three months, there were some co-variations uniquely associated with sulphate particles, the atmospheric pressure, and above all the ozone level (allowing for a gap of one day). The influence of the daily variations in total pollen content or of grass pollens did not show up in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie, H\u00f4pital Cochin, Paris."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marzin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Moullec", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ancelle", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Juhel", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Festy", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pretet", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Asthme, pollution atmosph\u00e9rique urbaine et m\u00e9t\u00e9orologie."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Rev Mal Respir", "NlmUniqueID": "8408032", "ISSNLinking": "0761-8425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspnea"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Medical Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Paris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8346367"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
