Few studies have documented the outcome of injection treatments for sinus tarsi syndrome. We sought to determine the effects of corticosteroid and local anesthetic (CLA), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and ozone injections on sinus tarsi syndrome.", "Sixty patients with sinus tarsi syndrome were randomly divided into three treatment groups: CLA, PRP, and ozone injections. Outcome measures were visual analog scale, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Scale (AOFAS), Foot Function Index, and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score before injection compared with 1, 3, and 6 months after injection.", "At the end of months 1, 3, and 6 after injection, significant improvements were observed in all three groups compared with baseline (P < .001 for all). At months 1 and 3, improvements in AOFAS scores were similar in the CLA and ozone groups; those in the PRP group were lower (P = .001 and P = .004, respectively). At month 1, improvements in Foot and Ankle Outcome Score were similar in the PRP and ozone groups and higher in the CLA group (P < .001). At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant differences in visual analog scale and Foot Function Index results among the groups (P > .05).", "Ozone, CLA, or PRP injections could provide clinically significant functional improvement for at least 6 months in patients with sinus tarsi syndrome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Agri Training and Research Hospital, Agri, Turkey.
