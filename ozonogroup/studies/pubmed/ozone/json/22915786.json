It has been demonstrated that controlled ozone administration may promote an adaptation to oxidative stress, preventing the damage induced by reactive oxygen species. Thus, we hypothesized that ozone would ameliorate oxidative damage caused by total body irradiation (TBI) with a single dose of 6 Gy in rat liver and ileum tissues. Rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: control group; saline-treated and irradiated (IR) groups; and ozone oxidative preconditioning (OOP) and IR groups. Animals were exposed to TBI after a 5-day intraperitoneal pretreatment with either saline or ozone (1 mg/kg/day). They were decapitated at either 6 h or 72 h after TBI. Plasma, liver and ileum samples were obtained. Serum AST, ALT and TNF-\u03b1 levels were elevated in the IR groups compared with the control group and were decreased after treatment with OOP. TBI resulted in a significant increase in the levels of MDA in the liver and ileal tissues and a decrease of SOD activities. The results demonstrated that the levels of MDA liver and ileal tissues in irradiated rats that were pretreated with ozone were significantly decreased, while SOD activities were significantly increased. OOP reversed all histopathological alterations induced by irradiation. In conclusion, data obtained from this study indicated that ozone could increase the endogenous antioxidant defense mechanism in rats and there by protect the animals from radiation-induced organ toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bulent Ecevit University, School of Medicine, Department of General Surgery, Kozlu, Zonguldak 67600, Turkey. faycagultekin@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gultekin", "ForeName": "Fatma Ayca", "Initials": "FA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bakkal", "ForeName": "Bekir Hakan", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guven", "ForeName": "Berrak", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tasdoven", "ForeName": "Ilhan", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bektas", "ForeName": "Sibel", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Can", "ForeName": "Murat", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Comert", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Radiat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376611", "ISSNLinking": "0449-3060"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Organ Failure"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Whole-Body Irradiation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mettler FA, Jr, Voelz GL.
