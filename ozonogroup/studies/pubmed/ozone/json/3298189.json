Fluorescent antibody (FA) stained B. fragilis group bacteria were enumerated microscopically and compared with faecal coliform or Escherichia coli counts as indicators of faecal contamination. Environmental samples included surface waters (raw drinking water and known contaminated water). Laboratory disinfection experiments with ozone, chlorine and u.v. radiation were also performed. Bacteroides FA counts specifically detected recent human faecal contamination in field samples in 2-3 h. Samples with a high content of particulates or debris limited the sensitivity to about 10 FA counts/ml. Viable counts showed that the sensitivity to all three disinfection agents was essentially the same for Bacteroides and E. coli. Fluorescent antibody counts of Bacteroides, conversely, were not altered by any of the agents. Therefore, the Bacteroides FA method is not recommended for routine monitoring but may be useful for cases where extensive human faecal contamination is suspected (e.g. pipeline rupture or pollution of recreational water) and where rapid remedial action must be taken to protect the public health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fiksdal", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berg", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "7503050", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8847"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteroides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteroides fragilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Antibody Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3298189", "10.1111/j.1365-2672.1987.tb04934.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
