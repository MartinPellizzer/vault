Work concerned the physical and chemical reactions of sulphur dioxide released from a power station. The investigation was based on the application of two tracers. Inactive, inert SF6 is used to monitor the dispersion of and deposition from the plume; it was intended to use radioactive 35SO2 to determine the degree of oxidation of sulphur released from the stack; so far, however, public reaction has prevented the use of a release of activity in field experiments. The report describes the construction and testing of airborne instruments for continuous registration of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and the tracer SF6, as well as for measurements of temperature and humidity. Sulphur samples were collected on filter paper in a specially constructed low volume air sampler, and the subsequentchemical analysis in the laboratory is described. Finally, the problem of navigation is treated. It is shown that nitrogen oxides may be used as an internal tracer in plume experiments. Preliminary experiments based on inactive analysis only indicated an overall half-life for SO2 in the plume of about half an hour."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flyger", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewin", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomsen", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fenger", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lyck", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gryning", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "RISO Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "7803386", "ISSNLinking": "0418-6443"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment and Supplies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["141094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
