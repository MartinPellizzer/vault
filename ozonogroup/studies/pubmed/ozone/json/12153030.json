Endotoxin concentrations were measured from 151 hepatotoxic, neurotoxic and non-toxic cyanobacterial water blooms by using Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, and the results were compared to bacterial data. Endotoxin activities ranged from 20 to 3.8 x 10(4) endotoxin units (EU) per ml. Endotoxicity of the samples correlated with phycobiliprotein concentration that was used to assess cyanobacterial abundance, heterotrophic plate count, and Aeromonas spp. but it did not correlate with the number of coliforms or streptococci. The high endotoxin concentrations occasionally detected in the water bloom samples were probably due to Gram negative bacteria that existed together with cyanobacteria since the 26 axenic cyanobacterial strains from different genera that were studied showed very low endotoxin activity. No differences in endotoxin activity were detected between hepatotoxic, neurotoxic and non-toxic strains. Removal of endotoxins during drinking water treatment was studied at nine waterworks that previously had been associated with high numbers of cyanobacteria and that used different processes for water purification. Endotoxin concentration in raw waters ranged from 18 to 356 EU ml(-1). The treatment processes reduced 59-97% of the endotoxin activity; in the treated water the concentration ranged from 3 to 15 EU ml(-1). The most significant reduction occurred at the early stages of water treatment, during coagulation, settling and sand filtration. Activated carbon filtration either increased or had no effect on endotoxin concentration. Ozonation and chlorination had little effect on the endotoxin concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Finnish Environment Institute, Helsinki. jarkko.rapala@vyh.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rapala", "ForeName": "Jarkko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lahti", "ForeName": "Kirsti", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "R\u00e4s\u00e4nen", "ForeName": "Leena A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Esala", "ForeName": "Anna-Liisa", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niemel\u00e4", "ForeName": "Seppo I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sivonen", "ForeName": "Kaarina", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12153030", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00478-x", "S0043-1354(01)00478-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
