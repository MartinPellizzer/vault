The effect of superficial gas velocity (0.05-0.15\u2005cm/s), UV<sub>AB</sub> irradiation (0-60\u2005W), treatment period (10-30\u2005min) and amount of activated carbon (0-0.8\u2005g/l) on removal efficiency was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken surface statistical design. Well-defined circulation pattern in the ALR allowed all the fluid elements to be exposed to high light intensity zone and achieve sufficient contact between the solid catalyst and the pollutant. Treatment period appeared as the most influential variable followed by the amount of activated carbon, superficial gas velocity and UV irradiation. A kinetic study was also carried out to evaluate the degradation efficiency versus the O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/AC, O<sub>3</sub>/UV and O<sub>3</sub>/AC/UV combinations in which the last one had the highest impact. Efficient suspensions of AC in the ALR resulted in the high efficiency of the O<sub>3</sub>/AC system. No significant difference was observed between the overall kinetic constants determined in O<sub>3</sub>/AC and O<sub>3</sub>/AC/UV systems due to the light transmission obstacle of solid suspension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5748-5406"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Advanced Chemical Engineering Research Centre, Faculty of Petroleum and Chemical Engineering , Razi University , Kermanshah , Iran."}], "LastName": "Farhadian", "ForeName": "Negin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6556-8743"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Advanced Chemical Engineering Research Centre, Faculty of Petroleum and Chemical Engineering , Razi University , Kermanshah , Iran."}], "LastName": "Behin", "ForeName": "Jamshid", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28162046", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1291757"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
