It is degraded rapidly when exposed to atmospheric ozone during post-hybridization washes, which leads to loss of fluorescent intensity. To minimize this undesirable effect, we coated microarray slides with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution at post-hybridization washes. The fluorescent intensities on coated slides were more stable than those on uncoated slide. We also performed the microarrays with SDS solution for a year to check the solution's effectiveness along with seasonal changes of atmospheric ozone level. Consistent results in microarray analysis were obtained using Cy5 dye under atmospheric ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
