Hepatotoxicity was induced by APAP given as a single dose of 300mg/kg intraperitoneally in Groups 2 and 3. Additionally, Group 3 received 20mcg/0.5mL ozone intraperitoneal twice a day for the remaining of the study. Other groups received saline injections. On the fourth day of the study, biochemical variables (AST, ALT, ALP) and liver histopathology was assessed.", "Intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of APAP induced hepatocellular damage that was shown by both liver enzymes and histopathological changes (p<0.001). AST, ALT, ALP levels were elevated in both groups 2 and 3 and the difference from group 1 was statistically significant (p<0.01).Mean ALT and AST levels of group 2 were statistically significantly higher versus group 3 (p<0.01). In histopathological examinations; necrosis and inflammation were more prominent in Group 2 compared to Group 3 (p<0.01).", "Ozone showed beneficial effects on APAP hepatotoxicity at a statistically significant level. It is known that ozone has therapeutic effects in various diseases owing to its antioxidant effects. The present study suggests that ozone may be utilized as a routine supplementary therapy in acute APAP hepatotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.
