The greatest synergism was observed when chlorine dioxide was used as a primary disinfectant followed by secondary disinfection with free chlorine. A lesser synergistic effect was observed when ozone was used as the primary disinfectant, but no synergism was observed when UV was used as the primary disinfectant. When free chlorine was used as the primary disinfectant (i.e., sequential application in the reverse order), the synergistic effect was shown only when chlorine dioxide was applied as the secondary disinfectant. The synergistic effect observed could be related to damage to the spore coat during primary disinfection, suggested by the loss of proteins from spores during disinfectant treatment. The greatest synergism observed by the chlorine dioxide/free chlorine pair suggested that common reaction sites might exist for these disinfectants. The concept of percent synergistic effect was introduced to quantitatively compare the extent of synergistic effects in the sequential disinfection processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Seoul National University, San 56-1, Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, 151-742, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jae-Hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Jeyong", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Buffers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Buffers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16884760", "10.1016/j.watres.2006.05.042", "S0043-1354(06)00343-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
