However, unsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to oxidation, which produces pro-inflammatory mediators. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a tropospheric pollutant that reacts rapidly with unsaturated fatty acids to produce electrophilic and oxidative mediators of inflammation.", "Determine whether supplementation with \u03c9-3 FA alters O<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative stress in human airway epithelial cells (HAEC).", "16-HBE cells expressing a genetically encoded sensor of the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG, E<sub>GSH</sub>) were supplemented with saturated, monounsaturated, or \u03c9-3 FA prior to exposure to 0, 0.08, 0.1, or 0.3\u00a0ppm O<sub>3</sub>. Lipid peroxidation was measured in cellular lipid extracts and intact cells following O<sub>3</sub> exposure.", "Relative to cells incubated with the saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids, cells supplemented with \u03c9-3 FA containing 5 or 6 double bonds showed a marked increase in E<sub>GSH</sub> during exposure to O<sub>3</sub> concentrations as low as 0.08\u00a0ppm. Consistent with this finding, the concentration of lipid hydroperoxides produced following O<sub>3</sub> exposure was significantly elevated in \u03c9-3 FA supplemented cells.", "Supplementation with polyunsaturated \u03c9-3 FA potentiates oxidative responses, as indicated by E<sub>GSH</sub>, in HAEC exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>. This effect is mediated by the increased formation of lipid hydroperoxides produced by the reaction of O<sub>3</sub> with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Given the inflammatory activity of lipid hydroperoxides, these findings have implications for the potential role of \u03c9-3 FA in increasing human susceptibility to the adverse health effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Corteselli", "ForeName": "Elizabeth M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Gold", "ForeName": "Avram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Surratt", "ForeName": "Jason", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Tianqu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Bromberg", "ForeName": "Philip", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Dailey", "ForeName": "Lisa", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.
