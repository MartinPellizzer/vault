Highly oxidized RO2 radicals bearing at least 5 O atoms in the molecule and their subsequent reaction products were detected in most cases by means of nitrate-CI-APi-TOF mass spectrometry. Starting from a Criegee intermediate after splitting-off an OH-radical, the formation of these RO2 radicals can be explained via an autoxidation mechanism, meaning RO2 isomerization (ROO \u2192 QOOH) and subsequently O2 addition (QOOH + O2 \u2192 R'OO). Time-dependent RO2 radical measurements concerning the ozonolysis of cyclohexene indicate rate coefficients of the intramolecular H-shifts, ROO \u2192 QOOH, higher than 1 s(-1). The total molar yield of highly oxidized products (predominantly RO2 radicals) from C5-C8 cycloalkenes in air is 4.8-6.0% affected with a calibration uncertainty by a factor of about two. For the most abundant RO2 radical from cyclohexene ozonolysis, O,O-C6H7(OOH)2O2 (\"O,O\" stands for two O atoms arising from the ozone attack), the determination of the rate coefficients of the reaction with NO2, NO, and SO2 yielded (1.6 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10(-12), (3.4 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10(-11), and <10(-14) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), respectively. The reaction of highly oxidized RO2 radicals with other peroxy radicals (R'O2) leads to detectable accretion products, RO2 + R'O2 \u2192 ROOR' + O2, which allows to acquire information on peroxy radicals not directly measurable with the nitrate ionization technique applied here. Additional experiments using acetate as the charger ion confirm conclusively the existence of highly oxidized RO2 radicals and closed-shell products. Other reaction products, detectable with this ionization technique, give a deeper insight in the reaction mechanism of cyclohexene ozonolysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Berndt", "ForeName": "Torsten", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Richters", "ForeName": "Stefanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kaethner", "ForeName": "Ralf", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Voigtl\u00e4nder", "ForeName": "Jens", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Stratmann", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , P.O.
