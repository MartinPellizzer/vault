Toxicity of 1-BP is poorly understood, but it may be a neurologic, reproductive and hematologic toxin. Sparse exposure information prompted this exposure assessment study using air sampling, and measurement of urinary metabolites. Mercapturic acid conjugates are excreted in urine from 1-BP metabolism involving removal of bromide (Br) from the propyl group. One research objective was to evaluate the utility of urinary Br analysis for assessing 1-BP exposure using a relatively inexpensive, commercially available method. Complete 48 h urine specimens were obtained from 30 workers on two consecutive days at two facilities using 1-BP adhesives to construct polyurethane foam seat cushions and from seven unexposed control subjects. All of the workers' urine was collected into composite samples representing three daily time intervals (at work; after work but before bedtime; and upon wake-up) and analyzed for Br ion by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Full-shift breathing zone samples were collected for 1-BP on Anasorb carbon molecular sieve sorbent tubes and analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection via NIOSH method 1025. Geometric mean (GM) breathing zone concentrations of 1-BP were 92 parts per million (p.p.m.) for adhesive sprayers and 11 p.p.m. for other jobs. For sprayers, urinary Br concentrations ranged from 77 to 542 milligrams per gram of creatinine [mg (g-cr)(-1)] at work; from 58 to 308 mg (g-cr)(-1) after work; and from 46 to 672 mg (g-cr)(-1) in wake-up samples. Pre-week urinary Br concentrations for sprayers were substantially higher than for the non-sprayers and controls, with GMs of 102, 31 and 3.8 mg (g-cr)(-1), respectively. An association of 48 h urinary Br concentration with 1-BP exposure was statistically significant (r(2) = 0.89) for all jobs combined. This study demonstrates that urinary elimination is an important excretion pathway for 1-BP metabolism, and Br may be a useful biomarker of exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Occupational Safety, Health, Center for Disease Control, Cincinnati, OH, USA. khanley@cdc.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hanley", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petersen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Curwin", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanderson", "ForeName": "W T", "Initials": "WT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Occup Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "0203526", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4878"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adhesives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9746DNE68", "NameOfSubstance": "1-bromopropane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Adhesives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16698849", "10.1093/annhyg/mel020", "mel020"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
