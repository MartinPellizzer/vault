It was found that the lowest DBPs and the highest inactivation of OPs such as Mycobacterium spp., Mycobacterium avium, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Hartmanella vermiformis, occurred in the effluent of the AR with 0.6\u202fmg/L phosphate addition. Based on the results of different characterization techniques, for the AR with 0.6\u202fmg/L phosphate-enhanced O<sub>3</sub>-BAC treatment, dissolved organic carbon in the influent exhibited the lowest concentration and most stable fraction due to the improved biodegradation effect. Moreover, the total amount of suspended extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the bulk water of the AR decreased greatly, resulting in the lowest chlorine consumption and DBPs formation in the AR. In Fourier transform infrared spectra of the suspended EPS, the amide II band (1600-1500\u202fcm<sup>-1</sup>) disappeared and the protein/polysaccharide ratio decreased remarkably, indicating the destruction of protein and a decrease in hydrophobicity. Moreover, \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices in the protein secondary structures were degraded while the random coils increased sharply as phosphate addition increased to 0.6\u202fmg/L, inhibiting microbial aggregation and hence weakening the chlorine-resistance capability. Thus, most of the OPs in suspended biofilms were more easily inactivated by residual chlorine, resulting in the lowest OPs occurrence in the effluent of the AR. Our findings indicated that enhancing the efficiency of the BAC filter by adding phosphate is a promising method for improving water quality in DWDSs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
