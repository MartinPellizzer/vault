Scenedesmus quadricauda (green alga) and Cyclotella sp. (diatom) were cultured under controlled conditions and harvested in the log or late log growth phase. Experiments examined the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) from the algal suspensions with and without preozonation. Preozonation with 1 mg/L increased chloroform formation from Scenedesmus by 17-44%. For Cyclotella, chloroform production increased by 5-26% with 1 mg/L ozone and by 39-109% with 3 mg/L ozone. Chlorinated HAA yields were not significantly increased after 1 mg/L ozone but increased by 38-76% for Cyclotella after 3 mg/L ozone. As compared to other sources of organic matter, algae under bloom conditions may contribute significantly to the DBP precursor pool. However, the majority of the DBP precursors (70%) were attributable to the cellular material, and thus removal of algae cells from a drinking water supply priorto oxidation will substantially reduce algal precursor concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 01003, USA. jplummer@wpi.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plummer", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edzwald", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diatoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11783642", "10.1021/es0106570"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
