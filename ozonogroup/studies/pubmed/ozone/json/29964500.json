Ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential of anthropogenic sources were also estimated. The results showed that the total anthropogenic VOCs emission was about 113.49 kt in Chang-Zhu-Tan region and the main sources were industrial processes, solvent utilization and vehicles with the VOCs emission of 35.88 kt, 28.72 kt and 22.13 kt, respectively. Paving pitch and architecture wall painting accounted for the majority of the solvent utilization and the building materials industry accounted for 75.34% of VOCs emission from the industrial processes. Liling was the largest contributor compared to the other cities in Chang-Zhu-Tan region, where the VOCs emission from these anthropogenic sources in 2014 was 16.58 kt. The total OFP of these sources was 375.33 kt, in which solvent utilization contributed 27.28% and the O<sub>3</sub> generative capacity of biomass burning was the largest. Solvent utilization contributed 35.35% to the total SOA formation potentials and its SOA generative capacity was also the largest. The spatial distribution characteristics revealed that the VOCs emission mostly originated from urban area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Xiang-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Da-Tong", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Research Academy of Environmental Protection, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yan-Rong", "Initials": "YR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964500", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201607185"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
