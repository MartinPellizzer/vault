The combined treatment was carried out at the laboratory scale on real primary effluent coming from a centralised plant treating the wastewater from a large tanning district in Northern Italy. SBBR performances with and without ozonation were compared resulting to be very satisfactory only in the latter instance where recorded COD, NH4-N and TSS average removals were 97%, 98% and 99.9%, respectively. Such efficiencies correspond to specific concentrations in treated effluent well below the limit values fixed by the in-force Italian regulations. Furthermore, it was proved that the combined process is characterised by a very low sludge production. In fact, the measured specific sludge production (0.03 kg TSS/kg COD(removed)) resulted unexpectedly much more lower than the value reported for conventional biological systems (i.e., 0.3-0.5 kg TSS/kg COD(removed))."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque C.N.R., Bari, Italy. irsacd41@area.area.ba.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Iaconi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lopez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramadori", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Pinto", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Passino", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12108713", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00445-6", "S0043-1354(01)00445-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
