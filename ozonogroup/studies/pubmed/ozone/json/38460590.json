Herein we synthesized bimetallic Mn-Pt catalysts based on zeolite to realize the switching of ROS reactions in catalytic ozonation for sustainable degradation of organic pollutants from water. The ROS reactions switched from singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, 71.01%) to radical-dominated (93.79%) pathway by simply introducing defects and changing Pt/Mn ratios. The oxygen vacancy induced by anchoring Mn-Pt species from zeolite external surface (MnPt/H-Beta) to internal framework (MnPt@Si-Beta) exposes more electron-rich Pt<sup>2+</sup>/Pt<sup>4+</sup> redox sites, accelerating the decomposition of O<sub>3</sub> to generate \u2022OH via electron transfer and switching ROS reactions. The Mn site acted as a bridge plays a critical role in conducting electrons from organic pollutants to Pt sites, which solidly solves the electron loss of catalysts, facilitating the efficient degradation of pollutants. A 34.7-fold increase in phenol degradation compared with the non-catalytic ozonation and an excellent catalytic stability are achieved by MnPt@Si-Beta/O<sub>3</sub>. The <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-dominated ROS reaction originated from MnPt/H-Beta/O<sub>3</sub> exhibits superior performances in anti-interference for Cl<sup>-</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. This work establishes a novel strategy for switching ROS reactions to expand the targeted applications of O<sub>3</sub> based AOPs for environmental remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
