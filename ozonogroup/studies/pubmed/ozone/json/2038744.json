RTE cells isolated from rats exposed to ozone (0, 0.14, 0.6, or 1.2 ppm, 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 1, 2, or 4 weeks) showed no increase in the frequency of preneoplastic transformation compared to cells isolated from unexposed rats, although ozone-induced morphologic changes were observed in exposed tracheas. In contrast, preneoplastic variants of RTE cells were induced by multiple, but not single, exposures of RTE cells to ozone in culture. RTE cells exposed biweekly to ozone (approximately 0.7 ppm for 40 min, nine total exposures) had approximately twofold increases in the frequency of preneoplastic transformation compared to that of concurrent controls exposed to air. Single, 40-min exposures to ozone (approximately 1 or approximately 10 ppm) did not induce preneoplastic variants. However, single, 40-min exposures of RTE cells to approximately 10 ppm ozone did result in approximately 40% decreases in colony-forming efficiency. In addition, single, 40-min exposures of RTE cells to approximately 1 ppm ozone reduced the transforming potency of a subsequent exposure to the direct-acting chemical carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). When multiple ozone exposures followed exposure to MNNG (approximately 0.7 ppm ozone for 40 min, nine biweekly exposures), an additive (or possibly a multiplicative) effect of ozone on MNNG-induced preneoplastic transformation was seen. These results demonstrate that ozone can, under some conditions, induce preneoplastic variants of RTE cells. In addition, depending on the sequence or combinations of exposures, ozone can reduce or, possibly, increase, the transforming potency of the carcinogen MNNG for rat tracheal cells in culture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomassen", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harkema", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stephens", "ForeName": "N D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Griffith", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "12H3O2UGSF", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitronitrosoguanidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitronitrosoguanidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Tracheal Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2038744", "10.1016/0041-008x(91)90197-m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
