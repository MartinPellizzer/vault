Soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability could change stomatal conductance which is the main driver of O<sub>3</sub> uptake into a leaf. In addition, the availability of N and P could influence photosynthesis and growth. We thus postulated that the sensitivity of plants to O<sub>3</sub> may be changed by the levels of N and P in the soil. In this study, a sensitive poplar clone (Oxford) was subject to two N levels (N0, 0\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>; N80, 80\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>), three P levels (P0, 0\u202fkg\u202fP\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>; P40, 40\u202fkg\u202fP\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>; P80, 80\u202fkg\u202fP\u202fha<sup>-1</sup>) and three levels of O<sub>3</sub> exposure (ambient concentration, AA; 1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202fAA; 2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202fAA) for a whole growing season in an O<sub>3</sub> free air controlled exposure (FACE) facility. Flux-based (POD<sub>0 to 6</sub>) and exposure-based (W126 and AOT40) dose-response relationships were fitted and critical levels (CLs) were estimated for a 5% decrease of total annual biomass. It was found that N and P availability modified the dose-response relationships of biomass responses to O<sub>3</sub>. Overall, the N supply decreased the O<sub>3</sub> CLs i.e. increased the sensitivity of poplar to O<sub>3</sub>. Phosphorus alleviated the O<sub>3</sub>-caused biomass loss and increased the CL. However, such mitigation effects of P were found only in low N and not in high N conditions. In each nutritional treatment, similar performance was found between flux-based and exposure-based indices. However, the flux-based approach was superior, as compared to exposure indices, to explain the biomass reduction when all nutritional treatments were pooled together. The best O<sub>3</sub> metric for risk assessments was POD<sub>4</sub>, with 4.6\u202fmmol\u202fm<sup>-2</sup> POD<sub>4</sub> as a suitable CL for Oxford poplars grown under various soil N and P conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
