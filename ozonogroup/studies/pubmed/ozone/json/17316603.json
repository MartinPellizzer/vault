However, these relationships have rarely been studied in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.", "From 1996 to 2000, biometeorological indices including meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind were used to measure thermal comfort in elderly people mortality (>65 years old), and CVD was quantified.", "Statistical analysis showed a significant negative loading between CVD and meteorological variables as well as thermal comfort indices. The CVD curve was a U-shaped, showing higher value for cold stress than for heat stress. The results clearly show seasonal variations in CVD mortality rates, which were higher in winter. Meteorological variables were found to play an important role as well as through the thermal comfort indices. The air pollutants, PM(10) and SO(2), except ozone, presented positive loadings with CVD, albeit less than statistically significant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences/Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. fgoncalv@model.iag.usp.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "F\u00e1bio L T", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braun", "ForeName": "Samuel", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dias", "ForeName": "Pedro L Silva", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharovsky", "ForeName": "Rodolfo", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urbanization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17316603", "10.1016/j.envres.2007.01.004", "S0013-9351(07)00017-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
