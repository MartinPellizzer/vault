Nine detectors for measuring erythemally weighted solar UV irradiance are distributed over Austria in order to cover the main populated areas as well as different levels of altitude. The detectors are calibrated to indicate the UV-Index, the internationally agreed unit for erythemally weighted solar UV irradiance. Calibration is carried out in the laboratory for determination of spectral sensitivity of each detector, and under the sun for absolute comparison with a well-calibrated, double-monochromator spectroradiometer. For the conversion from detector-weighted units to erythemally weighted units a lookup table is used, which is calculated using a radiative transfer model and which reflects the dependence of the conversion on the solar zenith angle and total ozone content of the atmosphere. The uncertainty of the calibration is about +/-7%, dominated by the uncertainty of the calibration lamp for the spectroradiometer (+/-4%). The long-term stability of this type of detectors has been found to be not satisfactory. Therefore, routinely every year all detectors are completely recalibrated. Variations of the calibration factors up to +/-10% are found. Thus, during routine operation, several measures take place for quality control. The measured data are compared to results of model calculations with a radiative transfer model, where clear sky and an aerosol-free atmosphere are assumed. At each site, the UV data are also compared with data from a co-located pyranometer measuring total solar irradiance. These two radiation quantities are well correlated, especially on clear days and when the ozone content is taken into account. If suspicious measurements are found for one detector in the network, a well-calibrated travelling reference detector of the same type is set up side-by-side, allowing the identification of relative differences of approximately 3%. If necessary, a recalibration is carried out. As the main aim for the Austrian UV monitoring network is the information of the public about the actual levels of UVB irradiance, the measurement results are published on-line in the Internet (http://www.uibk.ac.at/projects/uv-index). For the previous day and backwards approximately 2 years, the distribution of maximal UVB levels over Austria is shown on a regional map. Additionally, near real-time data of most of the measurement stations are presented with a delay of usually less than half-an-hour. Together with these actually measured data there is also shown the diurnal variation of the maximal expected value of the UV-Index under ideal clear conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Medical Physics, Muellerstreet 44, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.
