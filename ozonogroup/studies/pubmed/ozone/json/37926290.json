In the following, the efficacy of a gas-phase hydroxyl-radical process for decontaminating hatchery and table eggs was evaluated. Recovery of Salmonella was maximized through holding eggs in tryptic soy broth containing 20% w/v glycerol for 1 h prior to plating. By using this technique, it was possible to recover 63% of the theoretical Salmonella inoculated onto eggs. The continuous hydroxyl-radical reactor consisted of a bank of UV-C lamps (254\u00a0nm) that generated hydroxyl-radicals from the degradation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) mist and ozone gas. The optimal treatment was defined as that which supports a 5\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/egg reduction of Salmonella without negatively affecting egg quality or leaving H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> residues. A process of 2% v/v H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> delivered at 30\u00a0mL/min with a UV-C dose of 19\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and ozone (20 ppm) with a total treatment time of 10s was selected. The egg quality metrics (Haugh value, yolk index, albumin pH, yolk pH) did not negatively differ over a 35-day shelf-life at 4 or 25\u2103 compared to washed eggs or nontreated controls. The cuticle layer of eggs remained intact following hydroxyl-radical treatment. Fertilized eggs (n\u00a0=\u00a061) treated with the hydroxyl-radicals exhibited the same hatchery rate (75%) as nontreated controls (71-79%) with no defects (unhealed navels or red hocks) being observed. The same hydroxyl-radical treatment could be applied to table eggs to support >5\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/egg reduction of Salmonella and was compatible with egg washing regimes practiced in industry. In comparison, the egg washing process based on sodium hydroxide and chlorine supported a 2.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/egg reduction of Salmonella. The hydroxyl-radical treatment represents a preventative control step to reduce the carriage of Salmonella on hatchery and table eggs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
