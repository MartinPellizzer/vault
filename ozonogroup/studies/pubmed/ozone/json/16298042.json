Direct Blue 199 (DB 199) by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as ozonation, UV/H(2)O(2), and in sequence of ozonation with UV/H(2)O(2) processes were evaluated in this study. By ozonation alone, the color removal was almost 100% for DB 199 and greater than 80% for dye bath effluent rapidly within 5 and 15 min, respectively. Meanwhile, the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) was about 60% for DB 199 and almost no change for dye bath effluent, respectively due to incomplete mineralization. On the other hand, by UV/H(2)O(2) alone, the color removing not only took longer time but obtained lower removal efficiencies for DB 199 and dye bath effluent about 80% and 95% in 30 and 120 min, respectively. Nevertheless, it was more effective than ozonation for TOC removal while about 75% and 80% in 30 and 120 min, respectively. As a result, this study conducted the combination with the above two processes in order to shorten time demand as well as the higher removal efficiencies of both color and TOC simultaneously. Thus, the sequence process was designed to begin with ozonation to rapidly remove color proficiently, following by UV/H(2)O(2) in order to promptly remove remaining TOC efficiently. The successful process design by sequence of ozonation with UV/H(2)O(2) has proved the significant improvement for the removal of both color and TOC in dye bath effluent shortly. Besides, the lab prepared dye solution was substantially much easier to be decolorized than field dye bath effluent so that the lab results were utilized to design the further applications of pilot or full scale."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Hungkuang University, Shalu, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC. hyshu@sunrise.hk.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Hung-Yee", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "C.I.
