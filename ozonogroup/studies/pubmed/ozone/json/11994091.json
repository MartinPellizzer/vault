In NANIPER, the highest correlations of primary factors with symptomatology were found for symptom scores and sneezing with minimum daytime temperature (r = -0.62 and -0.45, respectively), ozone and NO concentrations. Patency and secretions were associated with minimum daytime temperature (r = -0.39 and 0.32, respectively). Time series analysis, however, correcting for several confounders such as autocorrelated symptomatology, showed that minimum daytime temperature and daytime relative humidity made an independent contribution to symptoms. In the control group, correlations were much lower, though present. Time series analysis was not possible.", "We conclude that in a mild climate with relatively low levels of pollution, minor pollution and meteorological disturbances result in substantial changes in nasal reactivity symptoms in NANIPER patients, but not controls, irrespective of other factors such as allergy or infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braat", "ForeName": "J P M", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulder", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duivenvoorden", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerth Van Wijk", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rijntjes", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fokkens", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "8906443", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7894"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11994091", "10.1046/j.1365-2222.2002.01359.x", "1359"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
