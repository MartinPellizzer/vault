In this context, we investigated the relationship between short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure and depression-related hospital admissions (HAs).", "The 10,459 records of HAs for depression from medical institutions across in 9 cities, China, were collected between 1 January 2017, and 31 December 2018.
