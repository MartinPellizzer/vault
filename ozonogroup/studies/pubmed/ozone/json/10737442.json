Since the early 1980s, controlled studies have demonstrated that exposure to elevated levels of ozone reduces inspiratory capacity in humans. In addition, ecologic analyses have indicated that daily emergency department visits for asthma exacerbations are elevated following days of high ozone pollution. The Partnership for a Smog-Free Georgia (PSG) is a state-sponsored program to reduce the number of days that ground-level ozone exceeds the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) in metropolitan Atlanta by providing federal and state subsidized commuting alternatives for local business employees. This report summarizes commuter data from three PSG partners to estimate reductions in emissions and monthly vehicle miles traveled that were associated with enrollment in PSG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "CollectiveName": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "7802429", "ISSNLinking": "0149-2195"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2000 Mar 10;49(9):189"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Private Sector"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Sector"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10737442"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
