Subgroup analyses by age and season were performed.", "In the hot season, hospitalisations were lowest at 27\u00b0C, rose to a peak at 30\u00b0C, then plateaued between 30\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C. The cumulative relative risk for lags 0-3\u2005days (RRlag0-3) for 30\u00b0C vs 27\u00b0C was 1.19 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.34). In the cold season, temperature was negatively associated with asthma hospitalisations. The cumulative RRlag0-3 for 12\u00b0C vs 25\u00b0C was 1.33 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.58). Adult admissions were most sensitive to temperatures in both seasons while admissions among children under 5 were least associated. Higher humidity and ozone levels in the hot season, and low humidity in the cold season were also associated with more asthma admissions.", "People with asthma should avoid exposure to adverse conditions by limiting outdoor activities during periods of extreme temperatures, combinations of high humidity and high temperature, and low humidity and low temperature, and high ozone levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.
