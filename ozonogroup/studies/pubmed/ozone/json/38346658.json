Even a series of atmospheric environment management policies have been conducted to win the \"blue sky defense battle\", the atmospheric secondary pollutants (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>) originated from oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) still threaten the air quality in GBA. However, there lacks a systematic summary on the emission, formation, pollution and environmental effects of OVOCs in this region for further air quality management. This review focused on the researches related to OVOCs in GBA, including their pollution characteristics, detection methods, source distributions, secondary formations, and impacts on the atmosphere. Pollution profile of OVOCs in GBA revealed that the concentration percentage among total VOCs from Guangzhou and Dongguan cities exceeded 50\u00a0%, while methanol, formaldehyde, acetone, and acetaldehyde were the top four highest concentrated OVOCs. The detection technique on regional atmospheric OVOCs (e.g., oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs)) underwent an evolution of off-line derivatization method, on-line spectroscopic method and on-line mass spectrometry method. The OVOCs in GBA were mainly from primary emissions (up to 80\u00a0%), including vehicle emissions and biomass combustion. The anthropogenic alkenes and aromatics in urban area, and natural isoprene in rural area also made a significant contribution to the secondary emission (e.g., photochemical formation) of OVOCs. About 20\u00a0% in average of ROx radicals was produced from photolysis of formaldehyde in comparison with O<sub>3</sub>, nitrous acid and rest OVOCs, while the reaction between OVOCs and free radical accelerated the NOx-O<sub>3</sub> cycle, contributing to 15\u00a0%-60\u00a0% cumulative formation of O<sub>3</sub> in GBA. Besides, the heterogeneous reactions of dicarbonyls generated 21\u00a0%-53\u00a0% of SOA. This review also provided suggestions for future research on OVOCs in terms of regional observation, analytical method and mechanistic study to support the development of a control and management strategy on OVOCs in GBA and China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
