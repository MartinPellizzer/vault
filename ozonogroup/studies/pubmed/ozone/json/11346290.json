The proposed treatment scheme could produce a filtered water with lower turbidity, COD(Cr) and colour at lower ozone and coagulant dosages. Ozone was added into the mixing tank with coagulant simultaneously and postozonation was not cost effective. With the increase of ozone dosage, better COD(Cr) and colour removals were observed especially at the ozone dosage between 0.7-1.0 mg l(-1). Similarly, increasing ferric sulphate dosage resulted in better removals of turbidity, COD(Cr) and colour in the filtered water. In contrast, increasing polymer T-80 dosage seemed to improve colour removal rather than turbidity and COD(Cr). To achieve removal efficiency of 70% for turbidity, 45% for COD(Cr) and over 60% for colour, the optimum dosages of ozone, ferric sulphate and polymer T-80 should be 0.7-1.0 mg l(-1), 10.0-12.5 mg l(-1) and 0.7-1.0 mg l(-1), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "D N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ukita", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3HWS7HF5XD", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11346290", "10.1080/09593332208618287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
