However, the impacts of heat waves on air quality can substantially vary depending on the characteristics of heat waves. In this study, we examine air quality changes in Seoul during heat waves and their associations with large-scale atmospheric patterns. For this, air quality data from 25 stations and meteorological data from 23 weather stations and reanalysis datasets during July and August of 2001-2021 are used. Under heat waves, the mean daily PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO concentrations decrease by 7.9\u00a0%, 6.1\u00a0%, and 4.6\u00a0%, respectively, whereas the mean daily PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase by 4.1\u00a0%, 17.2\u00a0%, and 2.9\u00a0%, respectively. The atmospheric circulation under heat waves is less favorable for long-range transport of air pollutants to Seoul. The PM<sub>2.5</sub>/PM<sub>10</sub> ratio increases under heat waves, indicating that the secondary formation of aerosols becomes more important under heat waves. 37\u00a0% of the heat wave days are accompanied by severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution exceeding the O<sub>3</sub> concentration standard in South Korea. There is a significant variability of air quality in Seoul within heat waves. The heat wave days with higher concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO than their non-heat wave means exhibit a prominent difference in large-scale atmospheric pattern from the heat wave days with lower concentrations. This difference is characterized by a zonal wave-like pattern of geopotential height, which is similar to the circumglobal teleconnection pattern known as one of the major patterns for heat waves in South Korea. This zonal wave-like pattern produces more stagnant conditions over Seoul."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
