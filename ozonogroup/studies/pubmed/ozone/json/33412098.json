This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of exposure to ambient O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> on the incidence of type 2 diabetes with consideration of other air pollutants in Taiwanese adults aged 30 to 50 years.", "A total of 6,426,802 non-diabetic participants aged between 30 and 50 years old were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 2005 and 2016. Incident type 2 diabetes was the main diagnosis at medical visits. Air quality data were provided by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. The air pollutant concentrations for each participant were estimated using the ordinary kriging method to interpolate daily concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), suspended fine particles (with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm; PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and suspended particles (with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10\u00a0\u03bcm; PM<sub>10</sub>) in residential districts across Taiwan. Six-year average concentrations of pollutants were calculated from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, and data were categorized into quartiles. We performed Cox regression models to analyze the long-term effects of exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> on the incidence of type 2 diabetes.", "The hazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of diabetes per each interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone exposure (3.30\u00a0ppb) was 1.058 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.053, 1.064) and 1.011 (95% CI: 1.007, 1.015) for SO<sub>2</sub> exposure (1.77\u00a0ppb) after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, urbanization level, temperature, humidity, and chronic comorbidities (Model 3). Furthermore, for every 3.30\u00a0ppb increase of O<sub>3</sub>, the HR for incident type 2 diabetes was 1.093 (95% CI: 1.087, 1.100) after controlling factors shown in Model 3 plus SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. On the other hand, for every 1.77\u00a0ppb increase of SO<sub>2</sub>, the HR for incident type 2 diabetes was 1.073 (95% CI: 1.068, 1.079) after controlling factors shown in Model 3 plus NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>.", "Long-term exposure to ambient O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> was associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes for Taiwanese population. Exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> may play a role in the adult early-onset type 2 diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
