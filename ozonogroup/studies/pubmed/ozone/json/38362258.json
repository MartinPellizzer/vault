The other main concerns in low-resource countries are the lack of an advanced anesthesia gas-scavenging system and modular surgical theatres. As a greenhouse gas that has been present in the atmosphere for more than 100 years and damages the ozone layer, nitrous oxide is three times worse than sevoflurane. Here, we conducted an observational study to quantify the annual nitrous oxide consumption and its environmental impact in terms of carbon dioxide equivalence in one of busiest tertiary health care and research centers in Northern India.", "Data related to nitrous oxide expenditure' from the operation theatre and manifold complex of our tertiary care hospital and research center from 2018 to 2021 were collected monthly and analyzed. The outcomes were extracted from our observational study, which was approved by our institutional ethics board (INT/IEC/2017/1372 Dated 25.11.2017) and registered prospectively under the Central Registry (CTRI/2018/07/014745 Dated 05.07.2018).", "The annual nitrous oxide consumption in our tertiary care hospital was 22,081.00, 22,904.00, 17,456.00, and 18,392.00 m<sup>3</sup> (cubic meters) in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. This indicates that the environmental impact of nitrous oxide (in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) from our hospital in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was 13,016.64, 13,287.82, 10,289.94, and 10,841.24 tons, respectively.", "This huge amount of nitrous oxide splurge is no longer a matter of laughter, and serious efforts should be made at every central and peripheral health center level to reduce it."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Journal of Dental Anesthesia and Pain Medicine."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0000-8555-8035"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Puri", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Chauhan", "ForeName": "Rajeev", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Luthra", "ForeName": "Ankur", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7451-3800"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Khurana", "ForeName": "Gauri", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6563-1477"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Hazarika", "ForeName": "Amarjyoti", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0645-2836"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India."}], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Shyam Charan", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Dent Anesth Pain Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101690691", "ISSNLinking": "2383-9309"}, "CoiStatement": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST: There is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ng JM, Hwang NC.
