The distributed sources were inextricably associated with hydrocarbons from exhaust, heavier hydrocarbons from contaminated urban soil, fugitive evaporations of gasoline and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), leakage from the industrial and commercial use of solvents, and the inert, ozone depleting gases permeating urban atmosphere. The sources' profiles were charted involving 60-120 VOC species per source. Spatial distribution of the sources was examined.", "The UNMIX application and the source profiling methods, by building robust chemical profiles of VOC sources, provided information that can be used to assign the measured VOC emissions to physical sources. This, in turn, provides means of assessing the impact of environmental policies, on one hand, and of industrial activities on the other hand on VOC air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "This work is available in Open Access model and licensed under a CC BY-NC 3.0 PL license."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Qu\u00e9bec at Outaouais, Gatineau, Canada (Department of Computer Science). eporada@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Porada", "ForeName": "Eugeniusz", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ottawa University, Ottawa, Canada (Department of Mathematics and Statistics). tkousha@uottawa.ca."}], "LastName": "Kousha", "ForeName": "Termeh", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Occup Med Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9437093", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1087"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Quebec"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26489941", "10.13075/ijomeh.1896.00509", "58550"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
