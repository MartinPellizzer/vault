Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered to each participant during pregnancy. GDM was defined according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria (IADPSG). Air pollutant (fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10\u00a0\u03bcm or less (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfate dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)) concentrations from the air monitoring stations in Foshan were used to estimate individual air pollutant exposure during the first two trimesters. Linear and logistic regression models were employed to estimate the associations between air pollution exposure during the first two trimesters and OGTT glucose levels and GDM.", "Of 12,842 pregnant women, 3055 (23.8%) had GDM. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> during trimester 1, trimester 2 and two trimesters were associated with 0.07\u00a0mmol/L to 0.29\u00a0mmol/L increment in OGTT-fasting glucose levels in single-pollutant model. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> during two trimesters were associated with 0.15\u00a0mmol/L and 0.12\u00a0mmol/L decrease in OGTT-fasting glucose in single-pollutant model. However, no significant or weaker effects of O<sub>3</sub> during two trimesters on OGTT-fasting glucose were observed in two-pollutant models. Moreover, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were associated with increased risk of GDM in both single- and two-pollutant models.", "Our study suggests PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> exposure during the first two trimesters might increase the risk of GDM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
