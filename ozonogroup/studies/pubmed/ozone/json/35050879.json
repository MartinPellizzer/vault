The bench-scale tests suggested a positive effect of UV and US on the degradation of atrazine within a limited energy range. The pilot-scale flow-through system was further tested by using response surface methodology. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> and its interaction with UV promoted the degradation of both COD and atrazine while its interaction with US inhibited the removal of COD but promoted the removal of atrazine. The optimal removal rate of atrazine (96.9%) was achieved in the condition of 6.86 W/L UV, 1.96 g/L\u00b7h O<sub>3</sub> and 294 W/L US. Chloride ions hindered the atrazine degradation, but the generated free chlorine radicals were still able to react with atrazine. In terms of energy-effectiveness, the configuration of 14.7 W/L UV and 1.96 g/L\u00b7h O<sub>3</sub> is the best option, which have the electrical energy per order of 181.6 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> for atrazine and 0.13 kWh/g COD. These method and findings could be helpful in the development of energy-efficient advanced oxidation processes in treating wastewater with high salinity and COD loadings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Diya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northern Region Persistent Organic Pollution Control (NRPOP) Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL A1B 3X5, Canada E-mail: bchen@mun.ca."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northern Region Persistent Organic Pollution Control (NRPOP) Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL A1B 3X5, Canada E-mail: bchen@mun.ca."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJA9M5H4IM", "NameOfSubstance": "Atrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atrazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35050879", "10.2166/wst.2021.633"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
