The impact of ozone dosage and initial organic concentration on color, COD and TOC removal rates were studied along with characterization of the major organics in raw and treated wastewater. The results suggested the ozone dosage of 3.15 g h(-1) (concentration 52.5 mg L(-1)) was suitable for the treatment. After 25 min ozonation of 1L raw wastewater, the color, COD and TOC removal efficiencies were 95%, 56% and 40%, respectively, with an influent COD concentration of 835 mg L(-1). The ratio of kg O(3) kg(-1) COD at 3.15 g h(-1) was 2.8 (<3), revealing that ozonation was a cost effective process for tertiary treatment of BIWW. Longer oxidization time was required to achieve similar results for raw wastewater with higher COD concentration. The chromatogram from gel permeation chromatography revealed that ozonation resulted in the breakdown of high molecular weight compounds into lower molecular weight components but could not completely mineralize the organic matter. The majority of these compounds were identified in both raw and ozonated samples via GC-MS analysis. In addition to ester derivatives as the main intermediates of ozonation, 1-chloroctadecane, methyl stearate, benzophenone and \u03b1-cyperone were identified as the by-products of ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
