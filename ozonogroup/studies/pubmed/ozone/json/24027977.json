HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) Model was used to investigate the potential sources of particulates during the pollution episodes. The results showed that the background concentration of O3 was (87.9 +/- 34.1) microg x m(-3). Seasonal variations of O3 loadings were observed, and the loadings decreased in the order spring > autumn > summer > winter. Analysis of correlation between O3 and other gas pollutants suggested regional transportation, stratospheric injection and photochemical production were the major sources of O3 in Wuyishan background station. The episodes were related with transportations of air parcel from Yangtze River Delta region, Pearl River Delta region and the high altitudes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Background Monitoring Station, Wuyishan of Fujian Province, Wuyishan 354302, China. binwys@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Bin-Bin", "Initials": "BB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24027977"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
