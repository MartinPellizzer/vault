A newly developed in vitro bioassay called nuclear receptor-ligand assay and GC-MS were both utilized to respectively determine the estrogenicity and individual EDCs in the wastewater samples. The original estrogenicity, expressed as the E2 equivalent concentration (EEQC), in the primary effluents was 315-1018 ng/L. Results indicate that the EEQC can be reduced rapidly to below 10 ng/L after ozonation. The appearance of 0.1 mg/L dissolved ozone (DO3), which corresponds to a consumed ozone amount of 0.4 mg per initial TOC (total organic carbon) of wastewater samples, was an appropriate operational parameter to simultaneously achieve efficient EDC removal and control of BrO3- and total organic bromine (TOBr). The presence of suspended solids in the range of 38-67 mg/L exhibited no obvious impact on the removal of nonsorbed estrogenicity. A complete decomposition of E2, E3 and BPA was achieved once 0.1 mg/L DO3 appeared in the primary effluent. The oxidative decomposition of NP was relatively less efficient with a residual concentration of 100 ng/L. This work investigates the feasibility of EDC removal and brominated byproduct control during ozonation of original municipal sewage prior to biological treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Heqing", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Harumi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuno", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2DI9HA706A", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FB33469R8E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estriol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MLT3645I99", "NameOfSubstance": "bisphenol A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Organic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Estriol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Estrone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18522121", "10.1021/es702714e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
