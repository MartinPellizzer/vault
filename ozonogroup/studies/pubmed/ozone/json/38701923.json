To address the challenge of mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emission during composting, this study investigated the response of N<sub>2</sub>O emission and denitrifier communities (detected by metagenome sequencing) to aeration intensities of 6\u00a0L/min (C6), 12\u00a0L/min (C12), and 18\u00a0L/min (C18) in cattle manure composting using multi-factor interaction analysis. Results showed that N<sub>2</sub>O emission occurred mainly at mesophilic phase. Cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emission (QN<sub>2</sub>O, 9.79\u00a0mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup> DW) and total nitrogen loss (TN loss, 16.40\u00a0%) in C12 composting treatment were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments. The lower activity of denitrifying enzymes and the more complex and balanced network of denitrifiers and environmental factors might be responsible for the lower N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Denitrification was confirmed to be the major pathway for N<sub>2</sub>O production. Moisture content (MC) and Luteimonas were the key factors affecting N<sub>2</sub>O emission, and nosZ-carrying denitrifier played a significant role in reducing N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Although relative abundance of nirS was lower than that of nirK significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), nirS was the key gene influencing N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Community composition of denitrifier varied significantly with different aeration treatments (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.931, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and Achromobacter was unique to C12 at mesophilic phase. Physicochemical factors had higher effect on QN<sub>2</sub>O, whereas denitrifying genes, enzymes and NO<sub>X</sub><sup>-</sup> had lower effect on QN<sub>2</sub>O in C12. The complex relationship between N<sub>2</sub>O emission and the related factors could be explained by multi-factor interaction analysis more comprehensively. This study provided a novel understanding of mechanism of N<sub>2</sub>O emission regulated by aeration intensity in composting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
