Tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) is known to accelerate leaf senescence and causes a decline of photosynthetic activity in leaves. However, the effects of age-related variation of O<sub>3</sub> on G<sub>m</sub> have not been well investigated, and we, therefore, analysed leaf gas exchange data in a free-air O<sub>3</sub> exposure experiment on Siebold's beech with two levels (ambient and elevated O<sub>3</sub> : 28 and 62\u2009nmol\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup> as daylight average, respectively). In addition, we examined whether O<sub>3</sub> -induced changes on leaf morphology (leaf mass per area, leaf density and leaf thickness) may affect CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion inside leaves. We found that O<sub>3</sub> damaged the photosynthetic biochemistry progressively during the growing season. The G<sub>m</sub> was associated with a reduced photosynthesis in O<sub>3</sub> -fumigated Siebold's beech in August. The O<sub>3</sub> -induced reduction of G<sub>m</sub> was negatively correlated with leaf density, which was increased by elevated O<sub>3</sub> , suggesting that the reduction of G<sub>m</sub> was accompanied by changes in the physical structure of mesophyll cells. On the other hand, in October, the O<sub>3</sub> -induced decrease of G<sub>m</sub> was diminished because G<sub>m</sub> decreased due to leaf senescence regardless of O<sub>3</sub> treatment. The reduction of photosynthesis in senescent leaves after O<sub>3</sub> exposure was mainly due to a decrease of maximum carboxylation rate (V<sub>cmax</sub> ) and/or maximum electron transport rate (J<sub>max</sub> ) rather than diffusive limitations to CO<sub>2</sub> transport such as G<sub>m</sub> . A leaf age\u00d7O<sub>3</sub> interaction of photosynthetic response will be a key for modelling photosynthesis in O<sub>3</sub> -polluted environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5263-2945"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Research on Terrestrial Ecosystems (IRET), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Via Madonna del Piano, Sesto Fiorentino, I-50019, Italy."}], "LastName": "Hoshika", "ForeName": "Yasutomo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sustainable Plant Protection (IPSP), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Via Madonna del Piano, Sesto Fiorentino, I-50019, Italy."}], "LastName": "Haworth", "ForeName": "Matthew", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, 183-8509, Japan."}], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Makoto", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-8689, Japan."}], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "Takayoshi", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "LIFE15 ENV/IT/000183", "Agency": "European Commission", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "LIFE15", "Agency": "European Commission", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "JPMJSC18HB", "Agency": "Japan Science and Technology Agency", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "Type B 23380078", "Agency": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "Young Scientists B 15K16136", "Agency": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "Young Scientists B 24780239", "Agency": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "B-1105", "Agency": "Ministry of the Environment", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "JPMJSC18HB", "Agency": "Ministry of the Environment", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesophyll Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Adachi S, Nakae T, Uchida M, Soda K, Takai T, Oi T, Yamamoto T, Ookawa T, Miyake H, Yano M, Hirasawa T (2013) The mesophyll anatomy enhancing CO2 diffusion is a key trait for improving rice photosynthesis.
