The VOCs were collected from the urban area of Hefei city via an off-line sampling method (SUMMA canister) and determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The average concentrations of VOCs were 17.65\u2009\u00b1\u200928.36 ppbv, which were mainly contributed by aromatics (10.02\u2009\u00b1\u200913.37 ppbv), haloalkane (5.37\u2009\u00b1\u20098.90 ppbv), ally halide (1.25\u2009\u00b1\u20093.36 ppbv), and aryl halid (1.02\u2009\u00b1\u20092.73 ppbv). According to the principal component analysis, three major sources were identified, including solvent use, vehicle exhaust, and industrial release, accounting for 70.6% of the total variance of the data. Health risk assessment was utilized to evaluate the potential adverse health effects of the individual VOC. The total hazard ratio in the selected area was higher than 1, where could pose health threat to exposed population. The cancer risk for benzene, carbon tetrachloride, trichloromethane, and 1, 2-dichloroethane were 4.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>, 4.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>, 3.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>, and 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>, respectively, indicating definite health risks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6243-6411"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, 710075, Shaanxi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center Station, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China. lgj@ustc.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, 710075, Shaanxi, China. lgj@ustc.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guijian", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, 710075, Shaanxi, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Ruoyu", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center Station, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center Station, Hefei, 230022, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fuhai", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0357245", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4341"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31932858", "10.1007/s00244-019-00704-y", "10.1007/s00244-019-00704-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
