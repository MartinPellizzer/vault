In this research, an innovative scrubbing process was examined in which ozone was injected into the VOC stream while the aqueous stream was augmented with hydrogen peroxide. The liquid phase reaction of ozone and hydrogen peroxide results in the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals in an advanced oxidation process. In this research, the effect of primary process parameters on the efficiency of the advanced oxidative scrubber (AOS) was examined. Test compounds included toluene, benzene, xylene, tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. A mathematical absorption model was developed for AOS system. Ozone, hydrogen peroxide, contaminant, and scavenger concentrations, as well as pH, all had a significant effect on the AOS efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Rexam Corporation , Spartanburg , South Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawson", "ForeName": "Richard B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b University of Missouri-Rolla , Rolla , Missouri , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "Craig D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28072373", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463959"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
