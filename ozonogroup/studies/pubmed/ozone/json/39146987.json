A mass loss of less than 10% due to the denuders was observed. Study results showed that if an impregnated denuder is not used, the results of atmospheric particle OC concentrations will be reported with higher values due to positive errors of 53.2 \u00b1 7.23% (median: 52.00%) on average. It was observed that the total error (net error) was still positive, but decreased to an average of 35.1 \u00b1 16.8% (median: 31.0%) after including the negative errors quantified from the backup filter into the calculation. In cases where denuders were not used in the sampling, it was observed that the results with positive errors of 41.0 \u00b1 14.6% (median: 33.8%) on average would be obtained for the total PAHs. Ozone-induced negative interference was the highest in Acenapthylene (28%), followed by Fluoranthane (20%), Phenanthrene (18%), and 15% for Np and Benzo[g,h,i]perylene compounds, relative to their medians. Negative errors of 10% or less were found in all other individual PAH compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
