Microbiological measurements declared that AOM reduced the initial total plate count (TPC) of SBWN significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with a prolonged shelf-life of 2\u00a0~\u00a05\u00a0days. Meanwhile, AOM reduced the cooking loss and water absorption along with the enhancement of hardness and tension force. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the protein network of surface and cross section became continuous and compact, and wrapped starch granules more effectively. Moreover, an obvious increase in the intensity of the high molecular protein bands was observed in the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) patterns. Furthermore, the sodium dodecyl sulfate extractable protein (SDSEP) under non-reducing condition obviously decreased, and then the SDSEP under reducing condition changed insignificantly (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). These results indicated that AOM mainly promoted the protein cross-linking of SBWN by disulfide bond (SS) cross-links."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
