HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al molar ratios (i.e., 25-300) were tested taking ozonation alone as control. The zeolites were more effective in reducing bromate formation for the filtered surface water than CeO\u2082, a former reported oxide that can reduce bromate formation at slightly acidic pH. The reduction efficiencies were not closely related to their Si/Al ratios. The HZSM-5 (Si/Al=300) selected for detailed studies effectively reduced bromate formation by 58% for the filtered water, and also enhanced the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during ozonation. The efficiency of the HZSM-5 in reducing bromate formation increased with ozone dose (0.38-1.16 mg O\u2083 mg\u207b\u00b9 DOC) and pH (6.6-9.3). The HZSM-5 adsorbed OBr\u207b (one of the critical intermediates in bromate formation) quickly with an adsorption capacity of 54 mg g\u207b\u00b9, but had no adsorption for ozone, Br\u207b, HOBr and BrO\u2083\u207b. It also significantly inhibited the formation of trace H\u2082O\u2082 which was generated from ozone decomposition and had been considered promoting bromate formation at low concentrations during ozonation. The reduction of bromate formation in O\u2083/HZSM-5 is possibly ascribed to the selective OBr\u207b adsorption in combination with the inhibited H\u2082O\u2082 formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
