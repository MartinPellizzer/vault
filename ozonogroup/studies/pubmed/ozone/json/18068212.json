Water used to extract bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands becomes toxic to various organisms due to the presence of naphthenic acids released from the bitumen. Natural biodegradation was expected to be the most cost-effective method for reducing the toxicity of the oil sands process water (OSPW). However, naphthenic acids are poorly biodegraded in the holding ponds located on properties leased by the oil sands companies. In the present study, chemical oxidation using ozone was investigated as an option for mitigation of this toxicity. Ozonation of sediment-free OSPW was conducted using proprietary technology manufactured by Seair Diffusion Systems Inc. Ozonation for 50min generated a non-toxic effluent (based on the Microtox bioassay) and decreased the naphthenic acids concentration by approximately 70%. After 130min of ozonation, the residual naphthenic acids concentration was 2mgl(-1): <5% of the initial concentration in the filtered OSPW. Total organic carbon did not change with 130min of ozonation, whereas chemical oxygen demand decreased by approximately 50% and 5-d biochemical oxygen demand increased from an initial value of 2mgl(-1) to a final value of 15mgl(-1). GC-MS analysis showed that ozonation resulted in an overall decrease in the proportion of high molecular weight naphthenic acids (n> or = 22)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2E9."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scott", "ForeName": "Angela C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zubot", "ForeName": "Warren", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "MacKinnon", "ForeName": "Michael D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Daniel W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fedorak", "ForeName": "Phillip M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YNM5U6B7A4", "NameOfSubstance": "naphthenic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18068212", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.10.051", "S0045-6535(07)01331-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
