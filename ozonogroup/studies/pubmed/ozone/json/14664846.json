The average mass concentration of PM10 was 109.0 +/- 54.1 microg/m3. Carbonaceous materials, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were the most important contributors to the PM10 component. On average, 64% of the PM10 was made up of fine particles. During PM10 episodes, average wind speed was 0.7 m/s and relative humidity was high, 83% on average, probably giving rise to stagnation of air pollutants and their entrapment close to the surface. With relative humidity < 70%, NO3-, NH4+, SO4(2-), carbonaceous materials, and PM10 mass showed high correlation with maximum hourly average ozone (O3M). Variation in atmospheric humidity may affect the gas-to-particle interactions of S and N species. The most significant contribution to PM10 in the Taichung urban basin was from the photochemical formation of secondary aerosols and carbonaceous materials in the atmospheric environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan. mtsaiyi@mail.chna.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Ying I", "Initials": "YI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Man T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14664846", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2003.09.021", "S0045-6535(03)00935-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
