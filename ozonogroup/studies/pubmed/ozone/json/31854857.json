Generally, the process of wood-based panel production includes glue making, glue mixing, sorting, and hot pressing, whereas the process of pharmaceutical manufacturing includes workshop production and wastewater treatment. The results showed that the main contribution species of VOCs in wood-based panel production and pharmaceutical manufacturing is oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), accounting for more than 50% of the total VOCs emitted. The species from organized and unorganized emissions of formaldehyde manufacturing differed significantly. The main species of organized emissions was OVOCs, and that of unorganized emissions was halohydrocarbons. Emissions of VOCs from coating manufacturing were strongly correlated with the raw materials, and the corresponding emission species were composed mainly of aromatics and OVOCs. Except for glue mixing, the main species of VOCs in other process procedures of wood-based panel production was formaldehyde, with emission proportion of more than 50%. The primary species of VOCs in various processes of pharmaceutical manufacturing was ethanol; however 1,4-dioxane, ethyl acetate, and toluene were also important species. Moreover, the main VOCs from formaldehyde manufacturing were composed mainly of acetone and ethanol, and those of coating manufacturing were aromatic hydrocarbons such as p-xylene. The ozone formation potential was to characterize the reactivity of pollution sources in VOCs from wood-based panel production, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and chemical production. The results showed that the species of VOCs in different industries contributed similarly to the reactivity and that these species were mainly high-activity species such as formaldehyde, ethanol, and other OVOCs as well as some aromatic hydrocarbons. Therefore, supervision and regulation of enterprises of industrial processes is required with a focus on species with relatively large ozone formation potential. In addition, it is necessary to analyze the emission characteristics and chemical mechanism of various industries and to control O<sub>3</sub> generation from the sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zi-Hang", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ke-Ying", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Qin-Wen", "Initials": "QW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Dan-Lin", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Feng-Xia", "Initials": "FX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Wen-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854857", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201903009"]}}]}
