Three evergreen tree species, Phoebe bournei (Hemsl.) Yang (P.\u00a0bournei), Machilus pauhoi Kanehira (M.\u00a0pauhoi) and Taxus chinensis (Pilger) Rehd (T.\u00a0chinensis), were exposed to non-filtered air, 100\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> air (E1) and 150\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> air (E2) in open-top chambers in subtropical China. In the entire period of experiment, O<sub>3</sub> fumigation decreased net photosynthesis rate (Pn) through stomatal limitation during the transition period from growing to non-growing season (TGN), and through non-stomatal limitation during the period of non-growing season (NGS) in all species tested. Meanwhile, O<sub>3</sub> fumigation reduced and delayed the resilience of Pn in all species tested during the transition period from non-growing to growing season (TNG). O<sub>3</sub> fumigation significantly decreased chlorophyll contents during NGS, whereas no obvious injury symptoms were observed till the end of experiment. O<sub>3</sub> fumigation induced increases in levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, total phenolics and reduced ascorbic acid, and changes in four plant endogenous hormones as well in all species tested during NGS. During NGS, E1 and E2 reduced Pn by an average of 80.11% in P.\u00a0bournei, 94.56% in M.\u00a0pauhoi and 12.57% in T.\u00a0chinensis, indicating that the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was in an order of M.\u00a0pauhoi\u00a0>\u00a0P.\u00a0bournei\u00a0>\u00a0T.\u00a0chinensis. Overall, O<sub>3</sub> fumigation inhibited carbon fixation in all species tested during NGS. Furthermore, O<sub>3</sub>-induced physiological activities also consumed the dry matter. All these suggested that elevated O<sub>3</sub>, which is likely to come true during NGS in the future, will adversely affect the accumulation of dry matter and the resilience of Pn during TNG in evergreen tree species, and further inhibit their growth and development in the upcoming growing season."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
