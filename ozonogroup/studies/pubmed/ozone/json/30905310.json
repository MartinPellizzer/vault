Based the B767 aircraft cabin mode, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of aircraft cabin had been built to study the distribution of ozone and the reaction product in the breathing zone, and the ozone risk under different air supply modes was evaluated. By comparing the three air supply modes, the simulation results show that the aisle air supply mode and personalized air supply mode made a high concentration of ozone and volatile organic compounds and increased absorbing risk in the breathing zone. Mixed air-supply mode made lower ozone risk in the breathing zone. But mixed air-supply mode can make a bad air mixture and makes a high ozone concentration near the cabin walls, which is needed to be improved.
