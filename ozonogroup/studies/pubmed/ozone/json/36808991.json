Here, high-resolution NO observations were conducted simultaneously in the surface ocean and the lower atmosphere of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea; moreover, NO production from photolysis and microbial processes was analyzed. The NO sea-air exchange showed uneven distributions (RSD = 349.1%) with an average flux of 5.3 \u00b1 18.5 \u00d7 10<sup>-17</sup> mol cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. In coastal waters where nitrite photolysis was the predominant source (89.0%), NO concentrations were remarkably higher (84.7%) than the overall average of the study area. The NO from archaeal nitrification accounted for 52.8% of all microbial production (11.0%). We also examined the relationship between gaseous NO and ozone which helped identify sources of atmospheric NO. The sea-to-air flux of NO in coastal waters was narrowed by contaminated air with elevated NO concentrations. These findings indicate that the emissions of NO from coastal waters, mainly controlled by reactive nitrogen inputs, will increase with the reduced terrestrial NO discharge."]}, "AuthorList":
