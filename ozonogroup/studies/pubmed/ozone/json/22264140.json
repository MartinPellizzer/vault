The effect of the MWNT loading and the MWNT oxidation, with acid solution or ultraviolet (UV)-ozone treatment, on the film properties such as surface roughness, work function, surface energy, optical transparency and conductivity were studied. Also pentacene thin film transistors and inverters were made with these composite films as a contact metal and the device characteristics were measured. The oxidation of MWNT reduced the conductivity of MWNT/PEDOT:PSS composite film but increased the work function and transparency. UV-ozone treated MWNT/PEDOT:PSS composite film showed higher conductivity (14000 \u03a9/\u25a1) and work function (4.9 eV) than acid-oxidized MWNT/PEDOT:PSS composite film and showed better performance as a source/drain electrode in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) than other types of MWNT/PEDOT:PSS composite films. Hole injection barrier of the UV-ozone treated MWNT/PEDOT:PSS composite film with pentacene was significantly lower than any other films because of the higher work function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "System on Chip Chemical Process Research Center, Department of Chemical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, POSTECH, Pohang 790-784, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Dong-Jin", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rhee", "ForeName": "Shi-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polystyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70KO0R01RY", "NameOfSubstance": "polystyrene sulfonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polystyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transistors, Electronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22264140", "10.1021/am201622j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
