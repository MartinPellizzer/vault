Increasing evidence has also shown that elevated levels of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) may contribute to COPD pathogenesis. However, the acute effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on SpO<sub>2</sub> among COPD patients remain unclear, especially for its time course. Therefore, we conducted this panel study with 3-day real-time monitoring for personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and concurrent SpO<sub>2</sub> of 39 participants (20 COPD patients, 19 healthy participants), aged 60 to 90\u00a0years, in Hong Kong to explore the acute effects of personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on SpO<sub>2</sub> (within minutes to hours). We applied a linear mixed effect model to examine the associations between personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub>, while adjusting for temporal trend, personal characteristics, weather conditions, and co-exposure to gaseous pollutants (ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxides, carbon monoxide, and atmospheric pressure). We found that short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> might result in acute declines of SpO<sub>2</sub> within minutes, and the effects would last for several hours. An interquartile range increase of personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure (17.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) was associated with -0.19% (95% CI: -0.26% to -0.12%) changes of concurrent SpO<sub>2</sub> for all participants. The most significant decline was observed at lag0-3\u00a0h, and then became insignificant at lag0-12\u00a0h. At lag0-1\u00a0h, estimated mean changes of SpO<sub>2</sub> were -0.40% (95% CI: -0.55% to -0.24%) for COPD patients and -0.09% (95% CI: -0.23% to 0.06%) for healthy participants. Compared with healthy participants, the effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on SpO<sub>2</sub> for COPD patients were slightly stronger and more acute. Reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations might be a useful approach to improve health status and reduce exacerbations for COPD patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
