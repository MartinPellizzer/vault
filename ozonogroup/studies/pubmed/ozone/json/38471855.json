The variation characteristics and annual changes of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen oxide (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>), total oxidant (O<sub><i>x</i></sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analyzed. The O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanism and its annual changes were studied using an Observation-Based Model (OBM), and VOCs source apportionments and their trends were discussed. The results indicated that \u2460 The volume fractions of O<sub><i>x</i></sub> and the concentrations of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and CO have decreased in the urban area of Suzhou in recent years, while the volume fractions of VOCs have increased, and sufficient photochemical conditions for O<sub>3</sub> formation still existed during polluted days. \u2461 The O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-VOCs sensitivity in Suzhou was in the VOCs-limited regime. The long-term reduction ratio between VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> should not be less than 5:1, and aromatics and alkenes were the critical VOCs for mitigating O<sub>3</sub> pollution. \u2462 The results of VOCs source apportionment revealed that industrial emissions, gasoline vehicle exhaust, and diesel engine exhaust were the major sources of VOC emissions in Suzhou. Industrial emissions and solvent usage declined from 2017 to 2021; however, gasoline vehicle exhaust and gasoline evaporation, which possess higher O<sub>3</sub> formation potential(OFP), increased significantly. \u2463 The OFP source apportionments results indicated that controlling VOC emissions from solvent usage and gasoline vehicle exhaust is crucial for O<sub>3</sub> pollution control in Suzhou."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Station, Suzhou 215000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Combined Pollution Monitoring, Department of Ecology and Environment of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ye-Zheng", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100041, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Combined Pollution Monitoring, Department of Ecology and Environment of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Combined Pollution Monitoring, Department of Ecology and Environment of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Combined Pollution Monitoring, Department of Ecology and Environment of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Combined Pollution Monitoring, Department of Ecology and Environment of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Combined Pollution Monitoring, Department of Ecology and Environment of Jiangsu Province, Suzhou 215000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Station, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suzhou Environmental Monitoring Station, Suzhou 215000, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Wen-Yuan", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Environment, Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, Beijing 100041, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471855", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202304103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
