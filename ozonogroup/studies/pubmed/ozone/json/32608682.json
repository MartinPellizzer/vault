The results showed that most organic pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater and tannery wastewater could be degraded by microbubble ozonation effectively. and COD was removed simultaneously. In addition, the biodegradability was improved and the bio-toxicity was eliminated significantly. The ratios of COD amount removed and ozone amount consumed were 0.77 and 1.02, respectively, in such advanced treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater and tannery wastewater, indicating different ozone oxidation efficiencies between pharmaceutical wastewater and tannery wastewater. The main types of organic pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater and tannery wastewater were determined by GC-MS and 3D-EEM, which showed the influence on treatment performance of microbubble ozonation. More refractory complex aromatic organic pollutants were found in pharmaceutical wastewater, which seemed more difficult to undergo degradation by microbubble ozone oxidation. As a result, the microbubble ozone oxidation of pharmaceutical wastewater was less efficient than that of tannery wastewater. The inorganic anions in both kinds of wastewater were unfavorable for ozone mass transfer, ozone decomposition, and\u00b7OH generation, which reduced the reaction efficiency of microbubble ozonation as well as biodegradability improvement. The lower concentrations of inorganic anions were better for microbubble ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shou-Jing", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jia-Ze", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xuan", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Na", "Initials": "RN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608682", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201907231"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
