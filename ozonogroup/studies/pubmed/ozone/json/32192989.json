The purpose of this study was to explore the association between short-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of TB outpatient visits in Hefei, China.", "Time-series analysis was used to assess the effect of short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants on the risk of TB outpatient visits. A Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to explore the association. The effects of different gender (male, female), age (\u226465 years old, >65 years old) and season (cold season, warm season) on the risk of TB were investigated by stratified analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of our findings.", "A total of 22,749 active TB cases were identified from November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018 in Hefei. The overall exposure-response curve showed that the concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) exposure were positively correlated with the risk of TB outpatient visits, while ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) exposure were negatively correlated with the risk of TB outpatient visits. The maximum lag-specific and cumulative relative risk (RR) of TB outpatient visits were 1.057 [95%CI: 1.002-1.115, lag 3 day] and 1.559 (95%CI: 1.057-2.300, lag 13 days) for each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3 increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>; 1.026 (95% CI: 1.008-1.044, lag 0 day) and 1.559 (95%CI: 1.057-2.300, lag 07 days) for each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3 increase in NO<sub>2</sub>; 0.866 (95% CI: 0.801-0.935, lag 5 day) and 0.852 (95%CI: 1.01-1.11, lag 0-14 days) for each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3 increase in SO<sub>2</sub> in the single-pollutant model. There was only a negative association between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and the cumulative risk of TB outpatient visits (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.960, 95%CI: 0.936-0.984, lag 07 days). Stratified analyses showed that the effects of SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure were different between warm and cold seasons. The effect of NO<sub>2</sub> exposure remained statistically significant in male, younger, and cold season subgroups. Besides, elderly people are more susceptible to PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure.", "This study suggests that exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> are associated with the risk of TB outpatient visits. Seasonal variation may have a greater impact on the risk of TB outpatient visits compared with gender and age."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
