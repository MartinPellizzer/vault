In order to assess the relevant environmental impacts of rice agro-ecosystems due to a specific process, using LCA method, two factors concerned with resource utilization and contaminant emissions were calculated in north of Iran during 2016 and 2017. All the management practices/inputs were monitored and recorded with the help of local experts without interference in farmer's practices. After preliminary evaluation, 100 paddy fields were selected in three planting systems (low input, conventional, and high input) which were predicted in two planting methods (semi-mechanized and traditional) in small, medium, and large farm size levels. Functional unit was considered as one ton paddy yield. The finding revealed that in both regions, all the impact categories and environmental pollutant were almost same and farmer's management practices are close to each other. Also, climate change (CC) in Amol and Rasht regions was 277.21 and 275.79\u00a0kg\u00a0CO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0eq., respectively. The most CC, global warming potential (GWP 100a), and cumulative energy demand (CED) in both regions were observed in high-input system for semi-mechanized method. Furthermore, the result for the impact categories of terrestrial acidification (TA), freshwater eutrophication (FE), marine eutrophication (ME), agricultural land occupation (ALO), water depletion (WD), metal depletion (MD), and fossil depletion (FD) was similar to the CC, GWP, and CED where the highest amounts in both regions statistically went to high-input system, traditional planting method, and small farms. Moreover, in both regions, high-input and conventional systems emitted higher heavy metals than low-input system. Furthermore, the most heavy metal emission in the air was achieved in small farm, and medium farm got the next rank. Additionally, the high consumption of chemical inputs, such as fossil fuels and fertilizers, in the high-input and conventional systems led to an increase of environmental pollutant in comparison with low-input systems. Therefore, to increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, as well as to reduce the environmental impacts of pollutant, reforming the pattern of chemical input consumption and reducing the use of non-renewable energy sources are essential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Ayatollah Amoli Branch, Islamic Azad University, Amol, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Habibi", "ForeName": "Ebrahim", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Ayatollah Amoli Branch, Islamic Azad University, Amol, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niknejad", "ForeName": "Yosoof", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Ayatollah Amoli Branch, Islamic Azad University, Amol, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fallah", "ForeName": "Hormoz", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosafety and Genetic Engineering, Agricultural Biotechnology Research Institute of Iran (ABRII), Karaj, Iran. salmandastan@ymail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dastan", "ForeName": "Salman", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Ayatollah Amoli Branch, Islamic Azad University, Amol, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tari", "ForeName": "Davood Barari", "Initials": "DB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fossil Fuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fossil Fuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone Depletion"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Int. 2004 Jul;30(5):701-20", "ArticleIdList": ["15051246"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2006 Aug;119(1-3):609-20", "ArticleIdList": ["16741808"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2009 Mar;90(3):1512-22", "ArticleIdList": ["19046619"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2011 Mar;92(3):967-73", "ArticleIdList": ["21126818"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2014 May 15;481:242-51", "ArticleIdList": ["24602908"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2017 Jul 1;196:217-223", "ArticleIdList": ["28288358"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2018 Aug 1;631-632:1279-1294", "ArticleIdList": ["29727952"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30826990", "10.1007/s10661-019-7344-0", "10.1007/s10661-019-7344-0"]}}]}
