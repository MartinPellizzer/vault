Motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emissions were characterized using laboratory simulations of roadway driving conditions and a variety of vehicle-fuel technologies (reformulated gasoline (RFG), methanol (M85), ethanol (E85), and natural gas (CNG)). Speciated organic compound (with Carter MIR ozone potential), CO, and NO(x) emission rates and fuel economy were characterized. The Carter MIR ozone potential of combined Federal Test Procedure (FTP) tailpipe and evaporative emissions was reduced more than 90% with CNG relative to RFG, M85, and E85 fuels. FTP toxic compound emissions (benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene) were greater with M85 and E85 fuels than with RFG fuel, and less with CNG fuel than RFG fuel. The most abundant toxic compound was benzene with RFG fuel, formaldehyde with M85 fuel, and acetaldehyde with E85 fuel. FTP MPG fuel economies were reduced with M85 and E85 fuels relative to RFG fuel, consistent with their lower BTU/gal. Energy efficiencies (BTU/mi) were improved with all the alternative fuels relative to RFG. Carter MIR ozone potential was generally reduced with the alternative fuels relative to RFG fuel under REP05 (high speeds and acceleration rates) driving conditions (most significantly with CNG). Toxic aldehyde emissions were reduced under REP05 conditions relative to FTP conditions with all the tested fuels, and toxic benzene emissions were elevated under high acceleration conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Black", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tejada", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurevich", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legislation as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9706038", "10.1080/10473289.1998.10463715"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
