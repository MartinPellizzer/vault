In a split-mouth design, teeth were assigned to experimental (with GO) and control (without GO) groups. GO was applied to teeth on one side and then the same brand of randomly selected FSs was applied to the teeth on both sides. Children were divided into 3 groups based on type of FS (Group 1: Aegis {Bosworth Co, North Hamlin Avenue Skokie, Illinois, USA}, Group 2: Fuji Triage {GC, Tokyo, Japan}, Group 3: Helioseal {Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein, Germany}). All FSs were then examined for retention rates at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; at the end of 12 months, all FSs were removed with an air-abrasion device and DIAGNOdent scores noted to compare with the initial values.", "The application of GO with either Fuji Triage or Aegis FS was effective on remineralization (p<0.05); however, the application of Helioseal FSs was not effective (p>0.05). The 1(st) and 12(th) months' full retention rates of Fuji Triage FSs was a significant difference (p<0.05) from other FSs (Aegis and Helioseal) (p>0.05).", "GO+Aegis FS showed the highest remineralization; and, at the end of 12 months, its clinical success was higher than other FSs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Unal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oztas", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Pediatr Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "9100079", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4628"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aegis Ortho adhesive"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glass Ionomer Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pit and Fissure Sealants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "fuji TRIAGE pink capsule"}, {"RegistryNumber": "103469-50-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Helioseal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Air Abrasion, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Cements"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Fissures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glass Ionomer Cements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Molar"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pit and Fissure Sealants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Remineralization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26161609", "10.17796/1053-4628-39.4.364"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
