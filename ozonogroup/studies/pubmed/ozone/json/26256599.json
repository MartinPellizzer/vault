This study was performed to develop an analytical method for TMCH using solid-phase extraction with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. TMCH is hydrophilic and a tertiary amine derivative, so Oasis(\u00ae) MCX cartridges were used as solid-phase cartridges. The recoveries of TMCH in tap and river waters as well as secondary effluent from a sewage treatment plant ranged from 75 to 94%. The limit of quantification of TMCH was 4 ng L(-1). The source of TMCH in the Yodo River basin was found to be effluent from one sewage treatment plant. The concentrations were < 4 ng L(-1) in raw water from water purification plants in regions other than the Yodo River basin, indicating that TMCH was used specifically in the basin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, National Institute of Public Health."}], "LastName": "Kosaka", "ForeName": "Koji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Asami", "ForeName": "Mari", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohkubo", "ForeName": "Keiko", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akiba", "ForeName": "Michihiro", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Anal Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8511078", "ISSNLinking": "0910-6340"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26256599", "10.2116/analsci.31.769"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
