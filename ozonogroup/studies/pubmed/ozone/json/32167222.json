In order to investigate whether glyburide prevents ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation and its mechanism, C57BL/6 mice were intratracheally pre-instilled with glyburide or the vehicle 1 hour before ozone (1 ppm, 3 hours) or filtered air exposure. After 24\u2009hours, the total inflammatory cells and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected. The pathological alternations in lung tissues were evaluated by HE staining. The expression of NLRP3, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-18 protein in lung tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Western blotting was used to examine the levels of caspase-1 p10 and active IL-1\u03b2 protein. Levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in BALF were measured using ELISA kits. Glyburide treatment decreased the total cells in BALF, the inflammatory score, and the mean linear intercept induced by ozone in lung tissues. In addition, glyburide inhibited the expression of NLRP3, IL-18, and IL-1\u03b2 protein in lung tissues, and also suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, including caspase-1 p10, active IL-1\u03b2 protein in lung tissues, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 in BALF. These results demonstrate that glyburide effectively attenuates ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury via blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley
