However, the use of the technology in natural water conditions is limited by low electrical conductivity and high operating costs. Herein, a novel electrochemical system was designed to overcome this constrain by coupling EP with a solid polymer electrolyte (EP-SPE). Performances of EP-SPE system were thoroughly evaluated by comparing the decomposition and energy efficiencies of various plasticizers in different systems. The EP-SPE system achieved 50% of pollutants mineralization in only 10\u00a0min with the electrolysis energy consumption of 1.0kWh\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, While the conventional EP system (not) adding salt compounds (CEP-(N) AS) need 30 (60)\u00a0min to reach 50% of pollutants mineralization with 3.8(26.6)kWh\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Kinetics and mechanisms of EP-SPE were investigated in detail, while electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detection and kinetic model revealed the occurrence, transient concentration and degradation contribution of reactive oxidizing species (ROS). Furthermore, tests of variety of SPEs and natural waters demonstrated universal applicability of EP-SPE. Additionally, EP-SPE did not show any performance deterioration after 15 runs. Therefore, this work provides a feasible technology for plasticizer purification in natural water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
