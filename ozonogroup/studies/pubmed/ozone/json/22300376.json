Both compounds have recently been detected in surface water, and carboxy-ACV has also been detected in drinking water. The experiments revealed a strong pH dependence of the oxidation of ACV and carboxy-ACV with reaction rate constants increasing by 4 orders of magnitude between the protonated, positively charged form (k(ox,PH(+)), \u223c2.5 \u00d7 10(2) M(-1) s(-1)) and the deprotonated, negatively charged form (k(ox,P(-)), 3.4 \u00d7 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)). At pH 8 a single oxidation product was formed which was identified via LC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS and NMR as N-(4-carbamoyl-2-imino-5-oxoimidazolidin)formamido-N-methoxyacetic acid (COFA). Using Vibrio fischeri , an acute bacterial toxicity was found for COFA while carboxy-ACV revealed no toxic effects. Ozonation experiments with guanine and guanosine at pH 8 led to the formation of the respective 2-imino-5-oxoimidazolidines, confirming that guanine derivatives such as carboxy-ACV are undergoing the same reactions during ozonation. Furthermore, COFA was detected in finished drinking water of a German waterworks after ozonation and subsequent activated carbon treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG), Koblenz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prasse", "ForeName": "Carsten", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "Manfred", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "Ralf", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ternes", "ForeName": "Thomas A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12133JR80S", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5Z93L87A1R", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4HES1O11F", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclovir"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyclovir"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Guanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Guanosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22300376", "10.1021/es203712z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
