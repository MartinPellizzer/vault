In contrast to previous protocols, in this system, microtubules recruit kinesin motor proteins from solution and place them on a surface. The kinesins will, in turn, facilitate the gliding of the microtubules along the surface before desorbing back into the bulk solution, thus being available to be recruited again. This continuous assembly and disassembly leads to striking dynamic behavior in the system, such as the formation of temporary kinesin trails by gliding microtubules. Several experimental methods will be described throughout this experiment: UV-Vis spectrophotometry will be used to determine the concentration of stock solutions of reagents, coverslips will first be ozone and ultraviolet (UV) treated and then silanized before being mounted into flow cells, and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy will be used to simultaneously image kinesin motors and microtubule filaments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassir Kazeruni", "ForeName": "Neda M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsitkov", "ForeName": "Stanislav", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University; hhess@columbia.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hess", "ForeName": "Henry", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.4.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Kinesins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoskeleton"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kinesins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microtubules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Imaging"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30741264", "10.3791/59068"]}}]}
