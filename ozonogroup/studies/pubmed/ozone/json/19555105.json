This system completely dissolved beech and spruce milled woods prepared from the Wiley woods (coarse wood meals prepared by a Wiley mill) by 2 h planetary ball-milling under the milling conditions employed. The dependence of the structural change of lignin on the degree of milling was examined to evaluate the correlation between the dissolution and lignin structure. The nitrobenzene oxidation analyses showed that the 2 h milling caused almost no structural change in the aromatic part of lignin in the milled woods. The ozonation analyses suggested that the decrease of the erythro ratio [erythro/(erythro + threo)] obtained from beta-O-4 structure in lignin is only 0.35% after the 2 h milling. Although the yield decrease of the ozonation products was 9.8% after the 2 h milling, this value was fairly smaller than that after a longer time milling. When it is taken into consideration that the other solvent systems for dissolution of wood meal, which are proposed by Lu and Ralph, require 5 h of milling under the same milling conditions to dissolve the milled woods, it is safely stated that the LiCl/DMSO solvent system completely dissolves milled wood, the lignin of which is structurally less altered and, thus, is expected to provide an improved method for structural analysis of the entire lignin fraction in wood cell wall."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterial Sciences, Wood Chemistry Laboratory, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhiguo", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yokoyama", "ForeName": "Tomoya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hou-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "Yuji", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G4962QA067", "NameOfSubstance": "Lithium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YOW8V9698H", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lithium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19555105", "10.1021/jf900441q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
