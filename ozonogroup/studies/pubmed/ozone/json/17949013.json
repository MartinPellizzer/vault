Arsenite, arsenate, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) were separated by anion exchange using carbonate-bicarbonate and NaOH eluents with step-gradient elution. The separated species were passed through a UV photooxidation reactor which decomposed the organic species and converted them to inorganic As(V). Subsequent on-line hydride generation with acid and sodium borohydride produces AsH3 and H2, which are separated from the liquid in a gas-liquid separator. The produced AsH3, driven by H2, reacts with ozone in a small reflective cell located atop a photomultiplier tube, resulting in intense CL. In the present form, the limits of detection (LODs, signal-to-noise = 3), based on peak height, for arsenite, arsenate, MMA, and DMA are 0.4, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3 microg/L, respectively, for a 100 microL injected sample. This analyzer demonstrates the robustness of the CL detection system for arsenic and provides an affordable alternative to atomic spectrometry for use as a detector after chromatographic speciation. We found no significant practical interferences."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409-1061, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Idowu", "ForeName": "Ademola D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dasgupta", "ForeName": "Purnendu K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17949013", "10.1021/ac701683h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
