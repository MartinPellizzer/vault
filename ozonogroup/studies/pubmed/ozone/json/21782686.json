The present study was carried out to investigate the potential adverse effects of 2-BP on pregnant dams and embryo-fetal development after maternal exposure during the gestational days (GD) 6-17 in ICR mice. The test chemical was administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice at dose levels of 0, 500, 1000, and 1500mg/kg per day. All dams were subjected to caesarean section on GD 18 and their fetuses were examined for external, visceral and skeletal abnormalities. Throughout the study period, no treatment-related deaths were found in the groups treated with 2-BP. Pregnant mice of the 1000 and 1500mg/kg groups showed treatment-related clinical signs such as rough fur and swelling, induration, crust formation, and ulceration in the injection sites which were dose dependent in incidence and severity. A decrease in fetal weight, an increase in fetal malformation, and an increase in fetal ossification delay were found at a dose level of 1500mg/kg per day in a dose-dependent manner. On the contrary, there were no adverse effects on body weight, body weight gain, gravid uterine weight, food consumption, gross finding at any dose tested. In addition, no treatment-related effects on the number of corpora lutea, implantations, resorptions, dead fetuses, live fetuses, and sex ratio of live fetuses were observed. These findings suggest that 2-BP was embryotoxic and teratogenic at a minimally maternally toxic dose (i.e., 1500mg/kg per day) in ICR mice. In the present experimental conditions, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of 2-BP is considered to be 500mg/kg per day for dams and 1000mg/kg per day for fetuses, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jong C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Dong H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Jeong D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Choong Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Moon K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyeon Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Seung C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Hyo I", "Initials": "HI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Mu K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21782686", "10.1016/j.etap.2003.11.003", "S1382-6689(03)00108-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
