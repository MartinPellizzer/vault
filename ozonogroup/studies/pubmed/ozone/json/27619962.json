The synthesized MnO<sub>2</sub> PHMSs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The results showed that PHMSs exhibit the excellent adsorption ability and catalytic activity owning to their hollow spherical structure, mesoporous shell and well-defined interior voids, leading to the strong adsorption for bisphenol A (BPA) and the retention of O<sub>3</sub> molecules on catalyst. Moreover, the catalytic performance of \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> PHMSs was better than that of \u03b4-MnO<sub>2</sub> PHMSs which was attributed to the richer lattice oxygen of \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> PHMSs to accelerate O<sub>3</sub> decomposition by producing more reactive oxidative species. The degradation efficiency of BPA using 3D \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> PHMSs was more than 90% in the presence of ozone within 30min reaction time. The probe tests for reactive oxidative species (ROSs) displayed that BPA degradation by catalytic ozonation is dominated by O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and OH in our present study. Furthermore, the organic compounds as intermediates of the degradation process were identified by LC/MS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
