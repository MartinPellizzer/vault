During the quarantine period (from January 24 to February 7, 2020), the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants decreased significantly relative to the period before controls were imposed (from January 15 to 23, 2020). Specifically, except for an increase in the concentration of O<sub>3</sub>, concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO decreased for 72.6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (45.86%), 47.4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>(41.24%), 25.6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (58.00%), 3.0 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (17.71%), and 0.5 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (31.40%), respectively. RAMS-CMAQ simulation showed that meteorological diffusion had an essential role in improving air quality. Influenced by meteorological factors, emissions of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2,</sub> and CO were reduced 26.04%, 33.03%, 28.35%, 43.27%, and 23.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO were reduced by 19.82%, 8.21%, 29.65%, -25.56%, and 8.12%, respectively, due to pollution emissions reductions during the quarantine period. O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased by 20.51% during quarantine, caused by both meteorological factors (10.47%) and human activities (10.04%). These results indicate that primary pollutants were more sensitive to emissions reductions; however, secondary pollutants demonstrated a lagged response the emissions reduction and were significantly affected by meteorological factors. The linear relationship between ozone and the emissions reduction was not significant, and was inverse overall. Further investigation are now required on the impact of emissions reduction on ozone pollution control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environment, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology and Policy Research Center, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hou-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environment, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Groundwater and Earth Sciences, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environment, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology and Policy Research Center, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environment, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology and Policy Research Center, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Sui", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environment, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technology and Policy Research Center, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Peng-Ju", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environment, Shandong Normal University, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ming-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mei-Gen", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33742919", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202007246"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
