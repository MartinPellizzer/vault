Ozonated naphthoresorcinol was mutagenic in TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA104 without S9 mix. By the addition of S9 mix, the mutagenic activity of ozonated naphthoresorcinol was markedly suppressed in TA98 and TA100, but became positive in TA102. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after derivatization to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones demonstrated the formation of glyoxal as an ozonation product of naphthoresorcinol. Ion chromatographic technique also demonstrated the formation of o-phthalic acid, muconic acid, maleic acid, mesoxalic acid, glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid as ozonation products. The mutagenicity assays of these identified products with five Salmonella showed that glyoxal and glyoxylic acid were directly mutagenic; the former in TA100, TA102 and TA104, the latter in TA97, TA100 and TA104. In the presence of S9 mix, glyoxylic acid gave a positive response of mutagenicity for TA102. The experimental evidence supported that glyoxal and glyoxylic acid may contribute to the mutagenicity of ozonated naphthoresorcinol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Setsunan University, Osaka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sayato", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamuro", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ueno", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50NP6JJ975", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyoxal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5X457YEW8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "naphthoresorcinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glyoxal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2959862", "10.1016/0165-1218(87)90055-3", "0165-1218(87)90055-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
