Ozone was adopted for the first time as a post-treatment method to remove the ARGs in composting product in this study. Ozone treatment significantly removed the total ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) once ozonation process finished. After 10-day storage stage, although the amount of total intracellular ARGs and MGEs increased, the total extracellular ARGs and MGEs decreased in the ozone-treated compost product. Correlation analysis revealed that the reduction in intracellular 16S rRNA contributed to intracellular tetQ and tetW removal, while the variations of other ARGs after ozonation related to MGEs abundance. Network analysis suggested that the reduction of potential host bacteria, as well as the decline in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and TOC after the ozonation, contributed to the intracellular ARGs removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
