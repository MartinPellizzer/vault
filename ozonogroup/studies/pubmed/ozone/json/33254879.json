The model captures the observed spatial distribution of summertime O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China (R\u00a0=\u00a00.78) and reproduces the observed increasing trends in two most populated city clusters: North China Plain (NCP) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Trend of simulated maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentration is 0.58 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup> in NCP and 1.74 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup> in YRD in JJA 2012-2017. Sensitivity studies show that both changes in anthropogenic emissions and meteorology favored the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> increases in these two regions with respective contributions of 39% and 49% in NCP, and 13% and 84% in YRD. In NCP, the 49% meteorology impact includes a considerable contribution from natural emissions (19%). Changes in biogenic VOCs, soil NO<sub>x</sub>, and lightning NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are estimated to enhance MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in NCP with a rate of 0.14, 0.10, and 0.14 ppbv yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In YRD, natural emissions made small contributions to the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> trend. Statistical analysis shows that higher temperatures and anomalous southerlies at 850\u00a0hPa in 2017 relative to 2012 are the two major meteorological drivers in NCP that favored the O<sub>3</sub> increases, while weaker wind speed and lower relative humidity are those for YRD. We further examined the trend of fourth highest daily maximum 8-h average (4MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> among a specific month that linked with extreme pollution episodes. Trends of simulated 4MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in NCP and YRD are 34-46% higher than those of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> and are found more meteorology-induced. Our results suggest an important role of meteorology in driving summertime O<sub>3</sub> increases in China in recent years."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
