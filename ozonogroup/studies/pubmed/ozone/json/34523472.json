In this work, CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/titanium nanotubes (TNTs) catalyst was successfully prepared by an impregnation-calcination method. Characterization results revealed that the crystal form of CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was bound to the surface of TNTs, the particle size is much smaller than the pure CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> crystal particle, which could weaken the influence of the internal diffusion process on its catalytic efficiency. The experimental results showed that the removal ratio of COD<sub>Cr</sub> in the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TNTs/O<sub>3</sub> system was approximately 14% higher than that of the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system. The dissolution of metal elements decreased to one-third that of the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system. The inhibition ratio of PW on the growth of E. coli K12 decreased 68% after the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TNTs catalytic oxidation process. Experimental results of complete capture experiments illustrated that the yield of HO\u2022 of the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TNTs/O<sub>3</sub> system was 10-19% higher than that of the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system. The elemental valence analysis revealed that the transition of Cu(II)-Cu(III) and Fe(II)-Fe(III) coexisted in the catalytic system. Besides, the surface hydroxyl groups promoted the electron transfer process and enhanced the ozone adsorption affinity. The proposed catalytic mechanisms of the CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TNTs/O<sub>3</sub> system were proposed via the above analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
