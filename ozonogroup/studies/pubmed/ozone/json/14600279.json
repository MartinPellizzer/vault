To determine its dermal, oral, and inhalation kinetics, 14 volunteers were exposed to 51.3 microg/ml MTBE dermally in tap water for 1 h, drank 2.8 mg MTBE in 250 ml Gatorade(R), and inhaled 3.1 ppm. MTBE for 1 h. Blood and exhaled breath samples were then obtained. Blood MTBE peaked between 15 and 30 min following oral exposure, at the end of inhalation exposure, and ~5 min after dermal exposure. Elimination by each route was described well by a three-compartment model (Rsq >0.9). The Akaike Information Criterion for the three-compartment model was smaller than the two-compartment model, supporting it over the two-compartment model. One metabolite, tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), measured in blood slowly increased and plateaued, but it did not return to the pre-exposure baseline at the 24-h follow-up. TBA is very water-soluble and has a blood:air partition ratio of 462, reducing elimination by exhalation. Oral exposure resulted in a significantly greater MTBE metabolism into TBA than by other routes based on a greater blood TBA:MTBE AUC ratio, implying significant first-pass metabolism. The slower TBA elimination may make it a better biomarker of MTBE exposure, though one must consider the exposure route when estimating MTBE exposure from TBA because of first-pass metabolism. Most subjects had a baseline blood TBA of 1-3 ppb. Because TBA is found in consumer products and can be used as a fuel additive, it is not a definitive marker of MTBE exposure. These data provide the risk assessment process of pharmacokinetic information relevant to the media through which most exposures occur-air and drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Caroline 27711, USA. prah.james@epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prah", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashley", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blount", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Case", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leavens", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pleil", "ForeName": "Joachim", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cardinali", "ForeName": "Frederick", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29I4YB3S89", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl tert-butyl ether"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Ethers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14600279", "10.1093/toxsci/kfh009", "kfh009"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
