In a parallel greenhouse experiment, plants were exposed for four months to either zero UV-B radiation or UV-B radiation equivalent to that of the supplemented outdoor treatment. In the field, the only significant changes in response to supplemental UV-B radiation were an increase in adaxial epidermal thickness and a decrease in total protein concentration. In the greenhouse-grown plants, UV-B radiation caused significant increases in abaxial cuticle thickness and trichome UV-B absorbing compounds. We conclude that Olea europaea exhibits high UV-B tolerance and will not be affected by the predicted increases in UV-B radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, Iera Odos 75, 11855 Botanikos, Athens, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liakoura", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V", "Suffix": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stavrianakou", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liakopoulos", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karabourniotis", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manetas", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10562409", "10.1093/treephys/19.13.905"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
