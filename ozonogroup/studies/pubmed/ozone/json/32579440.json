Meteorological conditions were the primary factor determining variations in daily average pollutant concentrations. The influence of urban infrastructure on meteorology is an important prediction on air quality. Understanding of the seasonal and diurnal secondary pollutant concentrations as a function of local meteorological conditions is necessary for urban air quality management. Micro-scale models for analyzing the surface layer interactions with the surrounding environment have recently gained attention. An attempt has been made to understand the effect of meteorology on air quality. This comprehensive study aims to assess the influence of local meteorology on urban air quality. The correlation was established between the change in meteorological parameters and mixing height on air quality at selected locations in a tropical urban environment. Results indicated the significant impact of land use patterns on the dispersion of air quality at study locations. Seasonal variations of ambient air temperatures at study locations were found to be more than 3\u00b0C in summer. Average mixing height variation among the study locations was observed to be more than 200 meters in summer. Results indicated the importance of wind velocity on the mixing height at study locations. The average concentrations of air quality parameters showed significant variation among the study locations. The maximum ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration was recorded at the Central Business District (CBD) during the afternoon, i.e., around 38.3\u00a0ppb, whereas it was 26.8 and 14.6\u00a0ppb at the Residential Area (RA) and Urban Baseline (UBL), respectively. A strong correlation was observed between ambient temperature and O<sub>3</sub> concentration during summer. In the winter, the average O<sub>3</sub> concentration in all three-study locations increased to 45.3\u00a0ppb, 45.8\u00a0ppb, and 58.5\u00a0ppb at UBL, RA, and CBD sites, respectively. The study reveals the impact of microenvironments on air quality. <i>Implications</i>: An attempt has been made to study the seasonal and diurnal variation of air quality levels in selected study regions with land cover change. This article focuses mainly on the surface temperature intensity variations with respect to the percentage of land use pattern change in Chennai city, India, and the subsequent effect on meteorology of dispersion conditions and air quality parameters has been studied. The relationship between local meteorology and air quality has been established."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8178-932X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Water Resource Engineering Division, IIT Madras , Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Swamy", "ForeName": "G S N V K S N", "Initials": "GSNVKSN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2575-4063"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Water Resource Engineering Division, IIT Madras , Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Nagendra", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3109-9459"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department Urban and Environmental Sociology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ , Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schlink", "ForeName": "Uwe", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Built Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32579440", "10.1080/10962247.2020.1783390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
