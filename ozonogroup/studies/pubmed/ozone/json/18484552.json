During the first period, patients were administered the placebo on the first night, followed by either zolpidem or the placebo on the second night (treatment night). The second crossover period was conducted after a minimum 3-day observation. Improvement in the overnight CAP rate was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the CAP variables, conventional sleep variables, EEG arousals, subjective evaluation of sleep quality (measured by means of a visual analogue scale and the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire), and drug safety.", "Zolpidem significantly decreased the overnight CAP rate values (57.6 vs. 39.0%, p=0.009) and improved \"sleep depth\" (p=0.044) and \"sleep quality\" (p=0.023) subjective questionnaire scores. Zolpidem also significantly improved VAS (p=0.036). The amount of time spent in sleep stages 3+4 was significantly increased by zolpidem without affecting the amounts of stage 2 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Significant negative correlations were found when the sleep quality score was matched to the CAP rate (p=0.022). No serious adverse events occurred during the study.", "In Japanese patients with psychophysiological insomnia, zolpidem increased sleep stability by significantly improving the overnight CAP rate.
