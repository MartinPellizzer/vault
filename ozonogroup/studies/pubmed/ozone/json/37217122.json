In our previously published work, the synthetic dye effluents were degraded using an ozonolysis-based Advanced Oxidation Process. In the present study, the degraded products of the three dyes were analysed using GC-MS at endpoint strategy and further subjected to in silico toxicity analysis using Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (TEST), Prediction Of TOXicity of chemicals (ProTox-II), and Estimation Programs Interface Suite (EPI Suite). Several physiological toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, cellular and molecular interactions, were considered to assess the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) and adverse outcome pathways. The environmental fate of the by-products in terms of their biodegradability and possible bioaccumulation was also assessed. Results of ProTox-II suggested that the azo dye degradation products are carcinogenic, immunotoxic, and cytotoxic and displayed toxicity towards Androgen Receptor and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential. TEST results predicted LC50 and IGC50 values for three organisms Tetrahymena pyriformis, Daphnia magna, and Pimephales promelas. EPISUITE software via the BCFBAF module surmises that the degradation products' bioaccumulation (BAF) and bioconcentration factors (BCF) are high. The cumulative inference of the results suggests that most degradation by-products are toxic and need further remediation strategies. The study aims to complement existing tests to predict toxicity and prioritise the elimination/reduction of harmful degradation products of primary treatment procedures. The novelty of this study is that it streamlines in silico approaches to predict the nature of toxicity of degradation by-products of toxic industrial affluents like azo dyes. These approaches can assist the first phase of toxicology assessments for any pollutant for regulatory decision-making bodies to chalk out appropriate action plans for their remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
