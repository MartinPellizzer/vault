Based on each case's home address, exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide, and ozone on each of the case and control days was assessed as the inverse distance-weighted average concentration at neighboring air quality monitoring stations. Conditional logistic regression models were implemented to quantify exposure-response associations.", "Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> (mean exposure on the same day of death and 1\u00a0day prior) was significantly associated with increased odds of MI mortality. The odds associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> exposures increased steeply before a breakpoint (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 33.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>; PM<sub>10</sub>, 57.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and flattened out at higher exposure levels, while the association for NO<sub>2</sub> exposure was almost linear.
