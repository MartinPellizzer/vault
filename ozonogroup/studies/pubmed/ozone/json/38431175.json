As ozonation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q) exhibited higher toxicity to coho salmon. However, studies on their environmental behaviors are still limited. Road dust is the major medium PPDs exist, which significantly affects the levels of PPDs in other mediums, especially surface water and particulate matter. In this study, road dust samples were collected in 55 major cities of China to explore the distribution characteristics of PPDs and 6PPD-Q. The concentrations of total PPDs (\u03a3PPDs) and 6PPD-Q in urban trunk road dust samples were in the ranges of 7.90-727 and 3.00-349\u00a0ng/g, with median concentrations of 68 and 49\u00a0ng/g, respectively. 6PPD and 6PPD-Q are the dominant components in most road dusts. The functional region-dependent pollution characteristics of PPDs and 6PPD-Q give the first finding that urban tunnel road was the highly polluted region, followed by urban trunk roads. Suburban road dusts had a lower pollution level. Moreover, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of PPDs and 6PPD-Q for children was much higher than adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
