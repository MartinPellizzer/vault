This study examined the impact on reproductive development of exposing Brassica campestris (Wisconsin Fast Plants) to ozone during vegetative growth. Plants were exposed to 70 ppb ozone for 2 d during late vegetative growth or 10 d spanning most of the vegetative phase. Effects on gas exchange, vegetative growth, reproductive development and seed yield were determined. Impacts on gas exchange and foliar injury were related to pre-exposure stomatal conductance. Exposure for 2 d had no effect on growth or reproductive characteristics, whereas 10-d exposure reduced vegetative growth and reproductive site number on the terminal raceme. Mature seed number and weight per pod and per plant were unaffected because seed abortion was reduced. The observation that mature seed yield per plant was unaffected by exposure during the vegetative phase, despite adverse effects on physiological, vegetative and reproductive processes, shows that indeterminate species such as B. campestris possess sufficient compensatory flexibility to avoid reductions in seed production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Black", "ForeName": "V J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Sciences Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roberts", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Sciences Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Black", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Andersen CP. 2003.
