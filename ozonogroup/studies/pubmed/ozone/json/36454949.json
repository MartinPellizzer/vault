However, the underlying mechanism of polar moieties on the hydrophobicity remains unclear. Here, we tailor the surface polar moieties of epoxy resin (EP) by ozone modification and assess their wetting properties. Our results show that, for the modified EP with more (60.54%) polar moieties, the polar effect on hydrophobicity cannot be empirically observed. To reveal the underlying mechanism, the absorption parameters, including equilibrium distance, adsorption radius, and effective adsorption sites for water on EP before and after ozone treatment, are calculated on the basis of molecular simulations. After ozone modification, the equilibrium distance (from 1.95 to 1.70 \u00c5), adsorption radius (from 3.80 to 4.50 \u00c5), and effective adsorption sites (from 1 to 2) change slightly and the EP surface remains hydrophobic, although the polar groups significantly increase. Therefore, it is concluded that the wetting properties of solid surfaces are dominated by the equilibrium distance, adsorption radius, and effective adsorption sites for water on solids, and the nonlinear relationship between polar groups and hydrophilicity is clarified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8245-2702"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mingru", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yafang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bingnan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Liuhao", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhonghua", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xinyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shihang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1014-8004"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710049, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shengtao", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36454949", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c02571"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
