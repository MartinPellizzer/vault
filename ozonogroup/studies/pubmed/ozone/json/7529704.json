A substantial data base was developed on the composition of diesel emissions; the fate of these emissions in the atmosphere; and the effects of whole particles and their chemical constituents on microorganisms, cells, and animals. Since that time, a number of significant developments have been made in diesel engine technology that require a new look at the future acceptability of introducing significant numbers of light-duty diesel automobiles into the European and American markets. Significant engineering improvements have been made in engine design, catalysts, and traps. As a result, particle emissions and particle associated organic emissions have been reduced by about 10 and 30 times, respectively, during the past 10 years. Research studies to help assess the environmental acceptability of these fuel-efficient engines include the development of an emissions data base for current and advanced diesel engines, the effect of diesel emissions on urban ozone formation and atmospheric particle concentrations, the effect of fuel composition, e.g., lower sulfur and additives on emissions, animal inhalation toxicology studies, and fundamental molecular biology studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ford Motor Company, Research Laboratory, Dearborn, MI 48121."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hammerle", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schuetzle", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1985 Jun 30;79(2):179-92", "ArticleIdList": ["4002222"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1986 Oct;41(1):144-67", "ArticleIdList": ["3757966"]}, {"Citation": "J Appl Toxicol. 1986 Dec;6(6):383-95", "ArticleIdList": ["2433325"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Ind Med. 1988;13(3):395-404", "ArticleIdList": ["3281456"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1988 Apr;137(4):820-5", "ArticleIdList": ["3354987"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Ind Med. 1988;13(3):381-94", "ArticleIdList": ["3354586"]}, {"Citation": "Postgrad Med. 1994 Aug;96(2):56-9, 63-6, 69-70 passim", "ArticleIdList": ["8041685"]}, {"Citation": "AMA Arch Ind Hyg Occup Med. 1954 Feb;9(2):164-77", "ArticleIdList": ["13113749"]}, {"Citation": "AMA Arch Ind Health. 1955 Feb;11(2):113-20", "ArticleIdList": ["13227636"]}, {"Citation": "Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1962 Aug;9:17-57", "ArticleIdList": ["13866550"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1990 Aug 31;249(4972):970-1", "ArticleIdList": ["2136249"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7529704", "PMC1566943", "10.1289/ehp.94102s425"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
