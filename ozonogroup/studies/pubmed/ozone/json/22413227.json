The device with ITO treated by ultraviolet-ozone (UV-ozone) was fabricated in the same run for comparison. It was found that the V2O5 solution-treated devices have much higher current efficiency compared to the device with bare ITO and UV-ozone-treated ITO as the anode. The turn-on voltages were reduced by around 2.5 V, and the luminances were about 1.69 times greater than that of the conventional device at 16 V driving voltage. Series resistances were determined by the slope of the current-voltage curve and the ac impedance spectroscopy technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Luminescence and Optical Information, Beijing Jiaotong University, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Suling", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fujun", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Qinjun", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22413227", "10.1166/jnn.2011.5205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
