In this study, rhodamine 6G (Rh6G)-labeled surface nanobubbles nucleated by the ethanol-water exchange were studied on differently cleaned borosilicate glass, silanized glass as well as self-assembled monolayers on transparent gold by combined AFM-FLIM. While the AFM data confirmed earlier reports on surface nanobubble nucleation, size, and apparent contact angles in dependence of the underlying substrate, the colocalization of these elevated features with highly fluorescent features observed in confocal intensity images added new information. By analyzing the characteristic contributions to the excited state lifetime of Rh6G in decay curves obtained from time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments, the characteristic short-lived (<600 ps) component of could be associated with an emission at the gas-water interface. Its colocalization with nanobubble-like features in the AFM height images provides evidence for the observation of gas-filled surface nanobubbles. While piranha-cleaned glass supported nanobubbles, milder UV-ozone or oxygen plasma treatment afforded glass-water interfaces, where no nanobubbles were observed by combined AFM-FLIM. Finally, the number density of nanobubbles scaled inversely with increasing surface hydrophobicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Chemistry I, Department of Chemistry and Biology & Research Center of Micro and Nanochemistry and Engineering (C\u03bc), University of Siegen , Adolf-Reichwein-Strasse 2, 57076 Siegen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hain", "ForeName": "Nicole", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Chemistry I, Department of Chemistry and Biology & Research Center of Micro and Nanochemistry and Engineering (C\u03bc), University of Siegen , Adolf-Reichwein-Strasse 2, 57076 Siegen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Wesner", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Chemistry I, Department of Chemistry and Biology & Research Center of Micro and Nanochemistry and Engineering (C\u03bc), University of Siegen , Adolf-Reichwein-Strasse 2, 57076 Siegen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Druzhinin", "ForeName": "Sergey I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Chemistry I, Department of Chemistry and Biology & Research Center of Micro and Nanochemistry and Engineering (C\u03bc), University of Siegen , Adolf-Reichwein-Strasse 2, 57076 Siegen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6nherr", "ForeName": "Holger", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "279202", "Agency": "European Research Council", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27268423", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01662"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
