However, ozone is highly toxic to the human body when the air concentration exceeds about 1 ppm. Therefore, there is increasing demand for simple, sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective techniques for sensing ozone gas. This article describes the features, advantages, and disadvantages of the available, practical techniques for sensing ozone gas in ambient air. The advantages of optical gas sensors as next-generation sensors is specifically introduced. The features of photoluminescent, semiconductor nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) as bright phosphors with the potential for various applications is further explored. Lastly, recent research results demonstrating the ozone sensitivity of photoluminescent CdSe-based core-shell quantum dots are presented. These results strongly suggest that optical ozone sensing using photoluminescent quantum dots is a promising technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ando", "ForeName": "Masanori", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Electronic Science and Graduate School of Environmental Science, Hokkaido University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Biju", "ForeName": "Vasudevanpillai", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shigeri", "ForeName": "Yasushi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Anal Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8511078", "ISSNLinking": "0910-6340"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29526892", "10.2116/analsci.34.263"]}}]}
