In contrast to other hydrazine reagents, MDNPH is oxidized by both ozone and nitrogen dioxide quantitatively to N-methyl-2,4-dinitroaniline (MDNA), which can be separated from the hydrazones of the lower aldehydes by means of HPLC. Unexpected elution orders are observed for the 1-methyl-1-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydrazones compared to those of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. Dual-wavelength detection is employed as a means for identification of different groups of the hydrazones and MDNA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abteilung Analytische Chemie, Anorganisch-Chemisches Institut, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster, Wilhelm-Klemm-Strasse 8, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcldt", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karst", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21639286", "10.1021/ac970146p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
