Real-time VOC and O<sub>3</sub> measurements were integrated with a building sensing platform to evaluate the influence of mechanical ventilation modes and human occupancy on the dynamics of skin oil ozonolysis products (SOOPs) in an office in a LEED-certified building during the winter. The ventilation system operated under variable recirculation ratios (RRs) from RR = 0 (100% outdoor air) to RR = 1 (100% recirculation air). Time-resolved source rates for 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA), and decanal were highly dynamic and changed throughout the day with RR and occupancy. Total SOOP source rates during high-occupancy periods (10:00-18:00) varied from 2500-3000 \u03bcg h<sup>-1</sup> when RR = 0.1 to 6300-6700 \u03bcg h<sup>-1</sup> when RR = 1. Source rates for gas-phase reactions, outdoor air, and occupant-associated emissions generally decreased with increasing RR. The recirculation air source rate increased with RR and typically became the dominant source for RR > 0.5. SOOP emissions from surface reservoirs were also a prominent source, contributing 10-50% to total source rates. Elevated per person SOOP emission factors were observed, potentially due to multiple layers of soiled clothing worn during winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9214-3719"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ray W.
