First, we identified a collection of observed pollutant combinations, which we define as multipollutant day types (MDTs), by applying a self-organizing map (SOM) to daily measures of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and particulate matter \u2264 2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Then, overdispersed Poisson time-series models were used to estimate associations between MDTs and each outcome using a 'clean' MDT referent and controlling for long-term, seasonal, and day-of-the-week trends and meteorology. Outcomes included daily emergency department visits for asthma and upper respiratory infection (URI), and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure (CHF) and ischemic heart disease (IHD).", "We found that a number of MDTs were significantly and positively associated (point estimates ranged from~2-5%) with cardiorespiratory outcomes in Columbia when compared to days with low pollution. Estimated associations revealed that outcomes for asthma, URIs, and IHD increased 2-4% on warm, dry days experiencing elevated levels of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. We also found that cooler days with higher NO<sub>2</sub> pollution associated with increased asthma, CHF, and IHD outcomes (2-5%).", "Our analysis continues support for using self-organizing maps to develop multipollutant exposure metrics and further illustrates how such metrics can be applied to explore associations between pertinent pollutant combinations and health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pearce", "ForeName": "John L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neelon", "ForeName": "Brian", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bozigar", "ForeName": "Matthew", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hunt", "ForeName": "Kelly J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Commodore", "ForeName": "Adwoa", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vena", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K99 ES023475", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R00 ES023475", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101719527", "ISSNLinking": "2474-7882"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of Interest: The authors\u2019 state no conflicts of interest for this research study."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Dominici F, Peng RD, Barr CD, and Bell ML, Protecting human health from air pollution: shifting from a single-pollutant to a multi-pollutant approach.
