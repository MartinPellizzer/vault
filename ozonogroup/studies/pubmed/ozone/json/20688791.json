Recent studies have demonstrated that a forward shift of deaths may only explain a very limited quantity of the excess mortality observed (up to 15%) during major heat waves. Moreover, the results seem to exclude that ozone acts as a confounding variable, whilst it remains a potential effect modifier.", "Future research needs to explore the consistency of results in new settings, to quantify the burden of heat-related morbidity and in particular to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented preventive measures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. martiello@unisi.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martiello", "ForeName": "Michele Arcangelo", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giacchi", "ForeName": "Mariano Vincenzo", "Initials": "MV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "100883503", "ISSNLinking": "1403-4948"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Heat Stress Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Outcome Assessment, Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20688791", "10.1177/1403494810377685", "1403494810377685"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
