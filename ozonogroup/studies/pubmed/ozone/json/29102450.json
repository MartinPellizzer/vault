Several studies have demonstrated that SR-B1 is also implicated in other physiological processes, such as bacteria and apoptotic cells recognition and regulation of intracellular tocopherol and carotenoids levels. Among the tissues where it is localized, SR-B1 has been shown to be significantly expressed in human epidermis. Our group has demonstrated that SR-B1 levels are down-regulated in human cultured keratinocytes by environmental stressors, such as cigarette smoke, via cellular redox imbalance. Our present study aimed to investigate whether such down-regulation was confirmed in a 3D skin model and under other environmental challengers such as particulate matter and ozone. We also investigated the association between oxidation-induced SR-B1 modulation and impaired wound closure. The data obtained showed that not only cigarette, but also the other environmental stressors reduced SR-B1 expression in epidermal cutaneous tissues and that this effect might be involved in impaired wound healing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Muresan", "ForeName": "Ximena Maria", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Sticozzi", "ForeName": "Claudia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Belmonte", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical, Surgery and Neurosciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."}], "LastName": "Savelli", "ForeName": "Vinno", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine (IBIMOL-UBA-CONICET), Pharmacy and Biochemistry School, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Evelson", "ForeName": "Pablo", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy; Plants for Human Health Institute, Animal Sciences Dept., NC Research Campus, NC State University, NC, USA.
