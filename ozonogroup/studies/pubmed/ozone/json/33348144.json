The pups aged 2-4 weeks were treated with ovalbumin (OVA) to establish a model of early life asthma. Asthma characteristics such as pulmonary inflammation, goblet cell proliferation, airway remodeling, OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E secretion and cytokines were examined.", "OVA sensitization and challenge successfully induced asthma in offspring. Compared with the air control, pulmonary inflammation infiltration, mucous secretion, the concentration of OVA-specific IgE, the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and T helper (Th) 2-skewed response were significantly exacerbated when O<sub>3</sub> exposure at GD13-18 following inhaling OVA, while pulmonary inflammatory infiltration, mucus secretion, and Th2-skewed response were not significantly changed when O<sub>3</sub> exposure at both GD1-6 and GD7-12. What's more, the above indicators in asthmatic offspring due to O<sub>3</sub> exposure at GD13-18 were more severe than at GD1-6 and GD7-12. Interestingly, the signs of asthma only appeared in the offspring after OVA inhalation. When offspring were not treated with OVA, the prenatal O<sub>3</sub> exposure alone did not lead to asthmatic reactions in offspring. In addition, O<sub>3</sub> exposure at GD13-18 markedly increased the number of neutrophils and macrophages in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) of asthmatic offspring, and significantly exacerbated Th2 immune imbalance in asthmatic offspring, but had no effect on Th17 immune imbalance.", "Exposure to O<sub>3</sub> during pregnancy aggravated asthma in offspring, in which the third trimester is the most sensitive window."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
