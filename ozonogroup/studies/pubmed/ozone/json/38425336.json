Exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS), which are analogous to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), are increasingly being used to elucidate links between the exposome and disease. Despite increased interest in the exposome, tools and publications that characterize exposure correlations and their relationships with human disease are limited, and there is a lack of data and results sharing in resources like the GWAS catalog. To address these gaps, we developed the PEGS Explorer web application to explore exposure correlations in data from the diverse North Carolina-based Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS) that were rigorously calculated to account for differing data types and previously published results from ExWAS. Through globe visualizations, PEGS Explorer allows users to explore correlations between exposures found to be associated with complex diseases. The exposome data used for analysis includes not only standard environmental exposures such as point source pollution and ozone levels but also exposures from diet, medication, lifestyle factors, stress, and occupation. The web application addresses the lack of accessible data and results sharing, a major challenge in the field, and enables users to put results in context, generate hypotheses, and, importantly, replicate findings in other cohorts. PEGS Explorer will be updated with additional results as they become available, ensuring it is an up-to-date resource in exposome science."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Oxford University Press 2024."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Lloyd", "ForeName": "Dillon", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8447-7871"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "House", "ForeName": "John S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Akhtari", "ForeName": "Farida S", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3148-2263"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Translational Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Schmitt", "ForeName": "Charles P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of the Director, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Fargo", "ForeName": "David C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sciome LLC, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Scholl", "ForeName": "Elizabeth H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sciome LLC, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Jason", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sciome LLC, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Choksi", "ForeName": "Shail", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sciome LLC, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Ruchir", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "Janet E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1346-2493"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Motsinger-Reif", "ForeName": "Alison A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exposome", "NlmUniqueID": "9918317685206676", "ISSNLinking": "2635-2265"}, "CoiStatement": "None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "\nWild CP.\nThe exposome: from concept to utility.
