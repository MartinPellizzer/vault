A 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model incorporating both multiphase flow and reaction kinetics describing ozone decay, hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) generation, and organic oxidation was developed to simulate the performance of continuous flow ozonation reactors. Formate was selected as the target organic in this study due to its well-understood oxidation pathway. Simulation results revealed that the dissolved ozone concentration in the reactor is controlled by rates of O<sub>3</sub>(g) interphase transfer and ozone self-decay. Simulations of the effect of various operating conditions showed that the reaction stoichiometric constraints between formate and ozone were reached; however, complete utilization of gas phase ozone was hard to achieve due to the low ozone interphase mass transfer rate. Increasing the O<sub>3</sub>(g) concentration leads to an increase in the formate removal rate by \u223c5% due to an enhancement in the rate of O<sub>3</sub>(g) interphase mass transfer. The CFD model adequately describes the mass transfer occurring in the two-phase flow system and confirms that O<sub>3</sub>(g) interphase mass transfer is the rate-limiting step in contaminant degradation. The model can be used to optimize the ozone reactor design for improved contaminant degradation and ozonation efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Boyue", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Shikha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Research Centre, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UNSW Centre for Transformational Environmental Technologies, Yixing, Jiangsu 214200, P.R.
