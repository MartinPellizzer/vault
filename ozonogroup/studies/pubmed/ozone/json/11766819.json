THM precursors could be divided into a fast and a slowly reacting fraction. Long term chlorine demand and the formation of THM could be described by second order kinetics. Rate constants were between 0.01 and 0.03 M(-1) s(-1) in the pH range 7-9 for surface waters and humic materials extracted from surface waters. A groundwater gave a higher rate constant of 0.124 M(-1) s(-1). Resorcinol-type structures were tested with respect to kinetics and yield of THM formation. They could possibly be responsible for the fast reacting THM precursors. which represent 15-30% of the THM precursors of natural waters. Additional classes of compounds that might contribute to the initial THM formation include readily enolizable compounds such as beta-diketones and beta-ketoacids. Experiments with phenol showed that slowly reacting THM precursors may consist of phenolic compounds. The influence of pretreatments (UV/visible irradiation, ozone and chlorine dioxide) on chlorine demand and THM formation from NOM was also studied: UV/visible irradiation does not alter THM formation but leads to a higher chlorine demand. Preoxidation with ozone leads to a lower THM formation with an unaltered chlorine demand and preoxidation with chlorine dioxide reduces THM formation and the chlorine demand."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technolocy (EAWAG), D\u00fcbendorf."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallard", "ForeName": "Herv\u00e9", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von", "ForeName": "Gunten Urs", "Initials": "GU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11766819", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00187-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
