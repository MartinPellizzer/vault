The 4 ozone treatments were (1) charcoal-filtered air, (2) unfiltered ambient air, (3) twice ambient and (4) three times ambient ozone, with treatments applied 12 h per day, 11 months per year for 28 months. Seedlings were irrigated weekly with one of three rain acidities: pH 33, 4.3 or 5.3 at a total rainfall equivalent of 133 cm per year. Photosynthetic rates were measured approximately every 10 weeks, on the most recently emerged branches each year. In 1988 the 3rd flush was measured, and in 1989 and 1990 the 1st flush of each year was measured. Elevated ozone concentrations generally reduced photosynthetic rates, especially during the summer months, but there was no evidence of either a threshold dose or a simple linear relationship between photosynthesis and ozone exposure. There was a seasonal drop in photosynthetic rates from March to September each year. An ontogenetic decrease in photosynthesis was also evident as trees matured. Stomatal conductance also decreased as the needles aged. Seedlings irrigated with pH 3.3 solution typically exhibited the highest photosynthetic rates, presumably due to a fertilizer effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, University of Florida, 118 Newins-Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Byres", "ForeName": "David P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, University of Florida, 118 Newins-Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Jon D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dean", "ForeName": "Thomas J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Byres, D.
