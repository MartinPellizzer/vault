We used data on atmospheric pollutants and meteorology from 2019 to 2021 to build an interpretable random forest (RF) model, applying this model to predict O<sub>3</sub> concentration in 2022 in five cities in the Southwest North China Plain. The model was also used to identify and explain the influence of various factors on O<sub>3</sub> formation. The correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> between the predicted O<sub>3</sub> concentration and observed O<sub>3</sub> concentration was 0.82, the MAE was 15.15\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and the RMSE was 20.29\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, indicating that the model can effectively predict O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the studying area. The results of correlation analysis, feature importance, and the driving factor analysis from SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model indicated that temperature (T), NO<sub>2</sub>, and relative humidity (RH) are the top three features affecting O<sub>3</sub> prediction, while the weights of wind speed and wind direction were relatively low. Thus, O<sub>3</sub> in the southwestern North China Plain may mainly come from the formation of local photochemical activities. The dominant factors behind O<sub>3</sub> also varied in different seasons. In spring and autumn, O<sub>3</sub> pollution is more likely to occur under high NO<sub>2</sub> concentration and high-temperature conditions, while in summer, it is more likely to occur under high-temperature and precipitation-free weather. In winter, NO<sub>2</sub> is the dominant factor in O<sub>3</sub> formation. Finally, the interpretable RF model is used to predict future O<sub>3</sub> concentration based on features provided by Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Weather Research & Forecast (WRF) model, and the simulation performance of CMAQ on O<sub>3</sub> concentration is enhanced to a certain extent, improving the prediction of future O<sub>3</sub> pollution situations and guiding pollution control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
