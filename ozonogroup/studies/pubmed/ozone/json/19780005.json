Detailed searches for English and German articles published between 2003 and 2008 were performed in a number of electronic databases. Further publications were identified by manual search. For summarizing the evidence, we considered only systematic reviews and controlled studies. The internal validity of reviews and studies was judged by two authors independently. Data extraction was performed by one author, and the extracted data was checked for completeness and correctness by a second author. The evidence of the efficacy of chemonucleolysis using chymopapain or collagenase is summarized in two recent, high-quality systematic reviews. We found 5 controlled studies evaluating nucleolysis using an oxygen-ozone mixture (O (2)O (3)-nucleolysis). Some of those studies were of limited methodological quality, but all showed the efficacy of O (2)O (3)-nucleolysis in comparison to microdiscectomy or the use of alternative substances. There is hardly any data regarding O (2)O (3)-nucleolysis complications. Regarding IDET, the authors of the 6 identified systematic reviews come to different conclusions about the efficacy of the procedure. The results of the 3 included controlled IDET studies, of which 2 are of high methodological quality, are also conflicting. The complication rates range from 0 to 15 %. In summary, the evidence of efficacy is presently more compelling for chemonucleolysis than for IDET. This may also be because indications for chemonucleolysis are more firmly established. However, safety aspects should be better evaluated and presented in the literature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ludwig-Boltzmann-Institut f\u00fcr Health Technology Assessment, Wien, Osterreich. rosemarie.felder-puig@lbihpr.lbg.ac.at"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Felder-Puig", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gyimesi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mittermayr", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geiger-Gritsch", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis"], "VernacularTitle": "Chemonukleolyse und intradiskale Elektrotherapie: was ist die gegenw\u00e4rtige Evidenz?"}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rofo", "NlmUniqueID": "7507497", "ISSNLinking": "1438-9010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymopapain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chymopapain"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Collagenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diskectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperthermia, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Chemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microsurgery"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19780005", "10.1055/s-0028-1109573"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
