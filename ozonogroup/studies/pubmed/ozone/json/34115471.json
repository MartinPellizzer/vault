In this work, we report the occurrence of secondary ion chemistry from interactions between a strong oxygen donor (such as O<sub>3</sub> and peracids) and acidic OVOCs (such as carboxylic acids and organic hydroperoxides) in the ion-molecule reaction (IMR) region of I-CIMS. Such interactions can lead to acidic organic molecules (HA or HB) clustering with [IO]<sup>-</sup> (e.g., [HA + IO]<sup>-</sup>) and dimer adducts ([A + B + I]<sup>-</sup>), in addition to the well-known iodide clusters ([HA + I]<sup>-</sup>). This ion chemistry was probed using common chemical standards as well as the gas-phase oxidation products of \u03b1-pinene and isoprene in a flowtube reactor. The results show that secondary ion chemistry can lead to misinterpretations of molecular compositions and distributions of the gas-phase products and an overestimation of the elemental O/C ratio overall. Nevertheless, the varying degrees of signal change in response to the secondary ion chemistry might be a clue to inform OVOCs' functionalities. Specifically, in the \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis system, the extents of ion signal reduction in the presence of additional acids in the IMR suggest that C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>4</sub> produced in the gas phase is a peracid, rather than the often-assumed pinic acid. Thus, we suggest that the potential application of the secondary ion chemistry to inform organic functionalities is promising, which could help better understand the molecular compositions of gas-phase OVOCs and the reaction mechanisms therein."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7936-4493"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California 92521, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Haofei", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34115471", "10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01486"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
