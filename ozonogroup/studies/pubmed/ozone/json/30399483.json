Using personal identification numbers, OHCA were linked to all previous hospitalizations in Sweden since 1987 to create susceptible groups based on the principal diagnosis code at discharge. Susceptibility was based on hospitalization for i) acute myocardial infarction; ii) heart failure; iii) arrhythmias; iv) diabetes; v) hypertension; and vi) stroke. Moving 2 and 24-h averages for O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> were constructed from hourly averages.", "A 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> higher 2-h average O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with a 2% higher risk of OHCA (95% CI, 0% 3%). Associations were similar for 24-h average O<sub>3</sub> and in individuals with or without hospitalizations for AMI, heart failure, diabetes, hypertension or stroke. Individuals with previous hospitalizations for arrhythmias had a lower risk of OHCA with higher O<sub>3</sub>.
