We addressed this knowledge gap by exposing seedlings of hybrid poplar clone '107' (Populous euramericana cv. '74/76') to elevated O3 (E-O3) and N availability variation in a factorial experiment. E-O3 decreased light-saturated net photosynthesis (Asat), mesophyll conductance (gm) and apparent maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax, based on intercellular CO2 concentration) but not actual Vcmax (based on chloroplast CO2 concentration) and increased respiration in light (Rd) at 25 \u00b0C. Nitrogen fertilization increased Asat, gm, Vcmax and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) and reduced Rd at 25 \u00b0C and the activation energy of actual Vcmax. No E-O3 or E-O3 x N interaction effects on the temperature response parameters were detected, simplifying the inclusion of O3 impacts on photosynthesis in vegetation models. gm peaked at 30 \u00b0C, apparent Vcmax and Jmax at 32-33 \u00b0C, while the optimum temperatures of actual Vcmax and Jmax exceeded the measured temperature range (15-35 \u00b0C). Ignoring gm would, thus, have resulted in mistakenly attributing the decrease in Asat at high temperatures to reduced biochemical capacity rather than to greater diffusion limitation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.
