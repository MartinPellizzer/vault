Deleterious effects of O<sub>3</sub> have been found in the respiratory system. Here, we examine whether O<sub>3</sub> alters olfactory behavior and cellular properties in the olfactory system. For this purpose, mice were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> at a concentration found in highly polluted city air [0.8\u202fppm], and the behavior elicited by social and non-social odors in habituation/dishabituation tests was assessed. In addition, the electrical responses of dopaminergic olfactory bulb (OB) neurons were also evaluated. O<sub>3</sub> differentially compromises olfactory perception to odors: it reduces responses to social and non-social odors in Swiss Webster mice, while this effect was observed in C57BL/6\u202fJ mice only for some non-social odors. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub> reduced the rate of spontaneous spike firing in periglomerular dopaminergic cells (PG-DA) of the OB. Because this effect could reflect changes in excitability and/or synaptic inputs, the ability of O<sub>3</sub> to alter PG-DA spontaneous activity was also tested together with cell membrane resistance, membrane potential, rheobase and chronaxie. Taken together, our data suggest the ability of O<sub>3</sub> to affect olfactory perception."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
