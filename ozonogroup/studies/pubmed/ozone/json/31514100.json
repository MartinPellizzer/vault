Additionally, the reduction of toxic halogenated by-products in (catalytic) ozonation was reported, which was not focused on previous researches before. Results showed that LCO catalytic ozonation improved the removal efficiency of BZA, UV<sub>254</sub> and SUVA via enhanced HO\u00b7 formation. Interestingly, LCO catalytic ozonation showed the ability on the reduction of aldehydes and toxic halogenated organic by-products. Moreover, the formed [trichloromethane (TCM)], [bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN)] and [dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm)] decreased significantly in catalytic ozonation. Catalytic ozonation was also able to remove DBPs precursors to decline the formation of DBPs, such as TCM, bromodichloromethane (BDCM), trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM). This process was involved in the transformation of EfOM in catalytic ozonation, which was confirmed by multi-spectrum methods, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) and hetero-spectral 2D-COS. In summary, LCO was shown to be an effective catalyst to improve the performance of the sole ozonation on the removal of emerging contaminants and DBPs precursors, as well as toxic by-products reduction. Additionally, the strategy of toxic by-products reduction in catalytic ozonation was proposed. Results indicated this technology was an important contribution on removal of refractory organics and formation of toxic by-products in water supply and wastewater treatment industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
