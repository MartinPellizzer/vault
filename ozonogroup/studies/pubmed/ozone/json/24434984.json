Synthesized magnetic Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2)-MIP composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and magnetic property measurement. The preferential catalytic ozonation of p-nitrophenol was evaluated in comparison with the competitive reaction in the presence of coexistent phenol. The results showed that the prepared Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2)-MIP composites exhibit strong adsorption ability due to the strong bonding between p-NP and the molecularly imprinted layer. The Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2)-MIP demonstrated a preferential catalytic ozonation of p-NP by the recognition ability of the molecularly imprinted layer to the target p-NP. The enhanced catalytic activity using Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2)-MIP composites could be attributed to the excellent recognition absorption of the MIP layer on the surface of Fe(3)O(4)/SiO(2)-MIP to p-NP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jiannan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shuzhen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yibin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou, 510275, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Technology on Electrochemical Energy Storage and Power Generation in Guangdong Universities, School of Chemistry and Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jinqing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Weichen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Technology on Electrochemical Energy Storage and Power Generation in Guangdong Universities, School of Chemistry and Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China E-mail: hechun@mail.sysu.edu.cn; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou, 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Shuanghong", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnetite Nanoparticles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XM0M87F357", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferrosoferric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y92ZL45L4R", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferrosoferric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetite Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24434984", "10.2166/wst.2013.629"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
