Using barometric whole-body plethysmography and increase in enhanced pause (Penh) as an index of airway obstruction, we measured the response of BALB/c mice to acute ozone inhalation to study the time course change of pulmonary function after ozone exposure.", "Penh was measured before and after exposure to filtered air or 0.12, 0.5, 1, or 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr (n = 6/group). In addition, Penh was measured 24, 48 and 72 hr after ozone exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histopathologic examinations were performed.", "The increase in Penh after ozone exposure was significantly higher in the 0.12, 0.5, 1 and 2 ppm groups compared with the control group (all p < 0.01). Increases in Penh 24 hr after ozone exposure were significantly lower than those immediately after acute ozone exposure; however, increases in Penh 72 hr after ozone exposure were significantly higher than those in the control group (each p < 0.01). The proportion of neutrophils in BAL fluid was significantly higher in the group exposed to 2 ppm ozone than in the groups exposed to filtered air or 0.12 ppm ozone (both p < 0.01).", "These results indicate that airway obstruction is induced following ozone exposure in a concentration-dependent manner and persists for at least 72 hr."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Cheju National University College of Medicine, 154, Samdo-2-dong, Jeju-si, Jeju-do 690-716, Korea. jas877@chollian.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "An Soo", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Inseon S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sun Wook", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Byung Cheol", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeum", "ForeName": "Chung Ho", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Joo Young", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Korean J Intern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8712418", "ISSNLinking": "1226-3303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HL6A2XXU5D", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium peroxymonosulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Obstruction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography, Whole Body"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Committee of the Environmental and Occupational Health Assembly of the American Thoracic Society Health effects of outdoor air pollution.
