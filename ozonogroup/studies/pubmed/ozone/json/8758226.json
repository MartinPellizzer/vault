The daily mean concentration was 13-25 micrograms/m3 for SO2, 33-41 micrograms/m3 for NO2, 19-41 micrograms/m3 for O3, and 58-109 micrograms/m3 for TSP during the different seasons. Values are means for various stations. The daily mean temperature during the three year period was +5.4 degrees C (range -37-27 degrees C).", "Positive associations with admissions were observed for O3 levels in all children under 14 years, and for SO2 levels in 15-64 year olds and among those older than 64. Significant associations were also seen between admissions for digestive tract diseases (the control) and O3 levels. This suggests that the modelling, which proved to be problematic, was unsatisfactory, or it may be a statistical coincidence. A rise in temperature was associated with a low number of admissions for asthma among 0-14 year olds and among 15-64 year olds, whereas humidity did not have a significant effect on the number of admissions.", "It is possible than even low level pollution may increase hospital admissions for asthma. However, definitive conclusions will be justified only after meta-analysis comprising several studies. The methodology was seen to have a strong effect on the results and standardised methods, possibly differing from those for the study concerning mortality, are needed to investigate the association between morbidity and ambient air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Helsinki City of the Environment."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00f6nk\u00e4", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Virtanen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Epidemiol Community Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7909766", "ISSNLinking": "0143-005X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Emergencies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Res. 1987 Aug;43(2):317-31", "ArticleIdList": ["3608935"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1990 Feb;51(1):51-70", "ArticleIdList": ["2298182"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1991 Mar-Apr;46(2):90-7", "ArticleIdList": ["2006899"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1991 Jan;90:181-7", "ArticleIdList": ["2050059"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1991 Aug 1;134(3):277-86; discussion 287-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1877586"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1991 Sep-Oct;46(5):262-70", "ArticleIdList": ["1953033"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1986 Aug;40(2):332-45", "ArticleIdList": ["3732204"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1993 Apr;147(4):826-31", "ArticleIdList": ["8466116"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1994 May;65(2):207-17", "ArticleIdList": ["8187737"]}, {"Citation": "Eur Respir J. 1995 Jun;8(6):1030-8", "ArticleIdList": ["7589368"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 1953 Feb 14;1(6755):336-8", "ArticleIdList": ["13012086"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1972 Sep;62(9):1181-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5056515"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Public Health. 1980 Jul;70(7):687-96", "ArticleIdList": ["7386702"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1992 Dec;59(2):362-73", "ArticleIdList": ["1464289"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8758226", "PMC1060890", "10.1136/jech.50.suppl_1.s59"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
