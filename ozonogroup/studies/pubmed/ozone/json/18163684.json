It is shown that the rate constant ratio between the two competing channels XYZ-->X+YZ and XYZ-->XY+Z is mainly determined by the difference of the zero-point energies of diatomic molecules YZ and XY and by the efficiency of the deactivation of the newly formed excited ozone molecules, whereas the mass-independent fractionation depends on a \"nonstatistical\" symmetry factor eta and the collisional deactivation efficiency. Formulas for the pressure effects on the enrichment and on the rate constant ratios are obtained, and the calculated results are compared with experiments and more exact calculations. In all cases, ratios of isotope rates and the pressure dependence of enrichments, the agreement is good. While the initial focus was on isotope effects in the formation of O(3), predictions are made for isotope effects on ratios of rate constants in other reactions such as O+CO-->CO(2), O+NO-->NO(2), and O+SO-->SO(2)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843, USA. yiqin@mail.chem.tamu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yi Qin", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marcus", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18163684", "10.1063/1.2806189"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
