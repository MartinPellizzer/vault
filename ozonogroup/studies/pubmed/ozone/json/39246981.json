Integrative oncology, combining conventional and complementary therapies, may offer additional benefits in managing these complex cases. We present a 68-year-old male farmer diagnosed with high-grade glioma in the left medial temporal lobe. The patient presented with severe headache, disturbed sleep, and anxiety, and experienced an episode of fever and seizure. He refused conventional radiation therapy due to concerns about side effects and opted for an integrative medicine protocol. This protocol included oncothermia, high-dose vitamin C therapy, hydrogen inhalation, ozone therapy, magnet therapy, fasting, acupuncture, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, yoga therapy, hydrotherapy, biologicals, and dietary modifications. The patient underwent 12 sessions of oncothermia over 24 days, combined with other integrative therapies. MRI scans before and after treatment showed a reduction in tumor size from 3.6 x 2.9 x 2.5 cm to 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm, corresponding to a 12% decrease in volume. Hematological parameters (complete blood count, liver function test, kidney function test, C-reactive protein), cancer markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, lactate dehydrogenase), and mental health indices (quality of life, survival rate) also showed significant improvement. The patient experienced no adverse events and reported enhanced quality of life. This case report suggests that an integrative oncology approach, combining oncothermia and various complementary therapies, may be an effective treatment option for high-grade gliomas, particularly for patients intolerant to conventional therapies. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is necessary to validate these findings and determine the specific contributions of each therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Nair et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Oncology, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Pradeep Mk", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Oncology, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Ramalakshmi", "ForeName": "Renganathan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Oncology, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Devibala", "ForeName": "Muniappan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Oncology, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Saranya", "ForeName": "Maruthanayagam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Oncology, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Sivaranjini", "ForeName": "Sekar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Modern Medicine, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Thangavelu", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Oncology, Mirakle Integrated Health Centre, Pollachi, IND."}], "LastName": "Mahalingam", "ForeName": "Manickam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
