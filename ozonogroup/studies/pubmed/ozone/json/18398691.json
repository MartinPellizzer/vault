The levels and variations of surface ozone were studied and the influences of meteorological parameters on ozone were analyzed. Annual and diurnal ozone variation patterns in Jinan both show a typical pattern for polluted urban areas. Daytime ozone concentrations in summer were the highest in the four seasons. However, during nighttime from 2100 to 0600 hours ozone concentrations in spring was higher than that in summer. Daily averaged ozone showed negative correlation with pressure and relative humidity and positive correlation with temperature, total solar radiation, sunshine duration and wind speed during the study period. Further studies show that, solar radiation is a primary influence factor for the daytime variations of ozone concentrations at this site; transport of pollutants by wind could enhance the pollution at this site; precipitation has a significant influence on decreasing surface ozone. A multi-day ozone episode from 16 to 21 June 2003 was observed at this site. Surface meteorological data analysis and backward trajectory computation show that the episode is associated with the influence of typhoon Soudelor, attributing to both local photochemical processes and transport of air pollutants from southeastern coastal region, especially Yangtze River Delta region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Science, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, People's Republic of China. wpshan@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wenpo", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yongquan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianda", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Xingyan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Huan Jing Ke Xue. 2006 Nov;27(11):2299-302", "ArticleIdList": ["17326444"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2007 Jun;147(3):489-506", "ArticleIdList": ["17084004"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Int. 2002 Dec;28(6):503-12", "ArticleIdList": ["12503916"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 2004 Feb;94(2):113-9", "ArticleIdList": ["14757374"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Int. 2001 Apr;26(4):213-22", "ArticleIdList": ["11341288"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2007 May;147(2):394-400", "ArticleIdList": ["16973249"]}, {"Citation": "Huan Jing Ke Xue. 2006 Jul;27(7):1276-81", "ArticleIdList": ["16881294"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2001;113(1):59-69", "ArticleIdList": ["11351762"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18398691", "10.1007/s10661-008-0255-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
