This may damage plants. Using physiological, proteomic and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods, we systematically studied the response of 16-day-old rice seedlings to UV [0.67 W m(-2) biologically effective UVB (UVB(BE)) and 0.28 W m(-2) UVA] exposure for 6, 12 and 24 h. UV exposure resulted in the appearance of light brown patches on leaves, a decrease in the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), lipid peroxidation, accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds (including flavonoids and other phenolic pigments) and differential expression of 22 proteins. Both physiological and molecular responses became stronger with increasing UV exposure time, indicating the effects of UV accumulation on plants. UV-induced responses included (i) phytohormone-regulative responses (up-regulation of proteins related to phytohormone synthesis such as IAA and ethylene); (ii) injurious responses (photosynthesis suppression, lipid peroxidation and visible injury); and (iii) protective responses (accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds and differential expression of proteins involved in detoxification/antioxidation, defense, protein processing, RNA processing, carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolism). The identification of UV-responsive proteins provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of plant responses to UV stress. Proteomic and qPCR analysis identified one up-regulated and two induced proteins with important functions: tryptophan synthase \u03b1 chain (production of radical oxygen species), glyoxalase I (detoxification/antioxidation) and a Bet v I family protein (defense). These results will contribute to future research into their roles in UV stress responses in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20 Nanxincun, Xiangshan, Haidian District, Beijing 100093, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Hongmei", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Kequan", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Keping", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteome"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proteome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21172955", "10.1093/pcp/pcq186", "pcq186"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
