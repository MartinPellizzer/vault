Despite a wealth of experimental research indicating that ozone's influence on agricultural production exhibits marked fluctuations and differs significantly across various geographical locations, previous studies using global statistical models often failed to capture this spatial-temporal variability, leading to uncertainties in ozone impact estimation. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the spatial-temporal variability of ozone impacts on maize and soybean yields in the United States (1981-2021) using a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model. Our results revealed that over the past four decades, ozone pollution has led to average yield losses of -3.5% for maize and -6.1% for soybean, translating into an annual economic loss of approximately $2.6 billion. Interestingly, despite an overall downward trend in ozone impacts on crop yields following the implementation of stringent ozone emission control measures in 1997, our study identified distinct peaks of abnormally high yield reduction rates in drought years. Significant spatial heterogeneity was detected in ozone impacts across the study area, with ozone damage hotspots located in the Southeast Region and the Mississippi River Basin for maize and soybean, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that hydrothermal factors modulate crop responses to ozone, with maize showing an inverted U-shaped yield loss trend with temperature increases, while soybean demonstrated an upward trend. Both crops experienced amplified ozone-induced yield losses with rising precipitation. Overall, our study highlights the necessity of incorporating spatiotemporal variability into assessments of crop yield losses attributable to ozone pollution. The insights garnered from our findings can contribute to the formulation of region-specific pollutant emission policies, based on the distinct profiles of ozone-induced agricultural damage across different regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
