N<sub>2</sub>O is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) and the primary stratospheric ozone depleting substance. The major anthropogenic source that contributes to N<sub>2</sub>O generation in aquifers is agriculture because the use of fertilizers has led to the widespread groundwater contamination by inorganic nitrogen (N) (mainly nitrate, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Once in the aquifer, this inorganic N is transported and affected by several geochemical processes that produce and consume N<sub>2</sub>O. An inventory of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations is presented and the highest concentration is about 18.000 times higher than air-equilibrated water (up to 4004\u03bcg N L<sup>-1</sup>). The accumulation of N<sub>2</sub>O in groundwater is mainly due to denitrification and to lesser extent to nitrification. Their occurrence depend on the geochemical (e.g., NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, dissolved oxygen, ammonium and dissolved organic carbon) as well as hydrogeological parameters (e.g., groundwater table fluctuations and aquifer permeability). The coupled understanding of both parameters is necessary to gain insight on the dynamics and the emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O in groundwater. Overall, groundwater indirect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions seem to be a minor component of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions to the atmosphere. Further research might be devoted to evaluate the groundwater contribution to the indirect emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O because this will help to better constraint the N<sub>2</sub>O global budget and, consequently, the N budget."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
