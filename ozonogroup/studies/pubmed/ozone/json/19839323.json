The present paper focuses on the effect of spectral range on the detected characteristic absorption structure of O3, and the variation of differential cross section of O3 with the change in spectral range and the source of interference in different spectral range. The effect of practical atmospheric light extinction on the light intensities of different spectral ranges was deduced; the effect of spectral range on the accuracy was determined by detecting the standard gases at different concentration and different spectral resolution. The optimized spectral range was determined for O3, which can yield high sensitivity, good selectivity and a reasonable time resolution for the accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Optical & Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics & Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Fu-Min", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-Qing", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Pin-Hua", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Fu-Qi", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Su-Wen", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19839323"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
