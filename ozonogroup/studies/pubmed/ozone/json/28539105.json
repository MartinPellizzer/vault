The presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was investigated in the ozonation of these two compounds. Experiments were carried out with both using distilled water and secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with pharmaceuticals. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) abatement rate improved when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added at the beginning of the ozonation process and when the ozone inlet concentration increased, attaining a maximum value of 91% and simultaneously a lower ozone waste for a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> initial concentration of 5\u2005mM and an ozone inlet concentration of 20\u2005g\u2005Nm<sup>-3</sup>. For these operation conditions, the water matrix has no significant impact on SMX and DCF removal, which were totally degraded in 45 and 60\u2005min, respectively. Nevertheless, lower COD degradation and ozone usage were obtained when the secondary effluent was used. Inorganic ions such as chloride, sulphate and nitrate and short-chain organic compounds were detected as by-products of the SMX and DCF oxidation. Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition tests revealed that simultaneous use of ozone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduced acute toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a CIEPQPF - Chemical Engineering Processes and Forest Products Research Center, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology , University of Coimbra , Coimbra , Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomes", "ForeName": "Daniela S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a CIEPQPF - Chemical Engineering Processes and Forest Products Research Center, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology , University of Coimbra , Coimbra , Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gando-Ferreira", "ForeName": "Lic\u00ednio M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a CIEPQPF - Chemical Engineering Processes and Forest Products Research Center, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology , University of Coimbra , Coimbra , Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quinta-Ferreira", "ForeName": "Rosa M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a CIEPQPF - Chemical Engineering Processes and Forest Products Research Center, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology , University of Coimbra , Coimbra , Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Rui C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "144O8QL0L1", "NameOfSubstance": "Diclofenac"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diclofenac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28539105", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1335351"]}}]}
