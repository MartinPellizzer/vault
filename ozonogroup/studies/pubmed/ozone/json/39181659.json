From July to October 2020, online monitoring was conducted in the main urban area of Shijiazhuang to collect data on VOCs and analyze their concentrations and reactivity. Additionally, the PMF (positive matrix factorization) method was utilized to identify the VOCs sources. Results indicated that the TVOCs (total VOCs) concentration was (96.7 \u00b1 63.4 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), with alkanes exhibiting the highest concentration of (36.1 \u00b1 26.4 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>), followed by OVOCs (16.4 \u00b1 14.4 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). The key active components were alkenes and aromatics, among which xylene, propylene, toluene, propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde, ethylene, and styrene played crucial roles as reactive species. The sources derived from PMF analysis encompassed vehicle emissions, solvent and coating sources, combustion sources, industrial emissions sources, as well as plant sources, the contribution of which were 37.80%, 27.93%, 16.57%, 15.24%, and 2.46%, respectively. Hence, reducing vehicular exhaust emissions and encouraging neighboring industries to adopt low-volatile organic solvents and coatings should be prioritized to mitigate VOCs levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
