The concentrations of six OPFRs in raw waters were at levels of 16.8-100.0\u00a0ng/L, and three OPFRs were below the detection limits. The traditional treatment processes could not effectively remove the OPFRs (the removal efficiency was\u2009-\u200912.0-15.4%). The advanced oxidation with ozone and GAC (the removal efficiency was 35.6-60.3%) or UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and GAC processes (the removal efficiency was 68.0-86.7%) were more effective than the traditional water treatment processes. The removal efficiencies of ultrafiltration process for the OPFRs was 11.2-69.8% which were positively correlated with the logKow values of OPFRs. The nanofiltration membrane process with ultrafiltration membrane process as the pretreatment was the most effective process (the removal efficiencies were almost to 100%). These results imply that the combination of ultrafiltration membrane and nanofiltration membrane is an effective measure in the treatment of OPFRs in municipal drinking water plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
