The total fatty acid content and ultrastructure of the current year needles were subsequently analysed. In acute, high concentration exposures, significant reductions in the levels of linolenic acid were detected. Increases in myristic or palmitic acid were common in needles exposed to lower concentrations of ozone. Ultrastructural studies revealed reductions in chloroplast size and a darkening of stroma at low ozone exposures while at high concentrations disruption of the chloroplast membranes was also identified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Ecological Laboratory, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, SF-70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anttonen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herranen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peura", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00e4renlampi", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091598", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)p2611-c", "0269-7491(94)P2611-C"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
