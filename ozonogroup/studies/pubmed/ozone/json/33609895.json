However, the conventional industrial method inevitably results in the generation of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O, etc.), which is the main cause of the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. Herein, we engineered five kinds of carbon dots (CDs) with different oxygen-containing functional groups on their surfaces, which were directly used as catalysts over the selective catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane. Among the five CDs, the hydroxyl-terminated CDs show the best catalytic activity with the conversion of cyclohexane\u00a0~\u00a029.43% and selectivity to AA\u00a0~\u00a095.89% under 130\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0atm with oxygen as oxidant. With the CDs directly as catalyst, the one-step efficient catalytic oxidation reaction for cyclohexane to AA was realized to replace the two-step routes. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) computational results were performed to further prove that the more quantity of hydroxyl on CDs and the higher O<sub>2</sub> pressure can boost the higher catalytic activity of CDs over oxidation of cyclohexane."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
