Synthetic PW was prepared adding toluene, xylene, naphthalene, phenol, acetic and malonic acids to a seawater matrix. Despite that in all AOPs studied in this work BTEX and naphthalene were removed, the efficiency (in terms of TOC removal) of each treatment varied largely. Among these techniques, photocatalysis was found to be the less effective for the treatment of PW, as TOC removals lower than 20% were obtained for the best scenario after 4\u202fh treatment. In the contrary, best results were obtained by ozonation combined with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, where all the organic components were removed, including a high percentage of acetic acid, which was not abated by the rest of the AOPs studied. The optimum conditions for ozonation were 4\u202fg\u202fh<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> and 1500\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH\u202f10, where after 2\u202fh a 74% of TOC removal was achieved and the acetic acid elimination was 78%. This condition enabled that ozonation process accounted for the lowest electric energy consumption per order of target compound destruction regarding total organic carbon (TOC)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
