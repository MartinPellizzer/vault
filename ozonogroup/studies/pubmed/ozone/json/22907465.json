Of particular concern is fugitive odours emitted from the handling and use of refinery condensate streams, particularly the digestion condensate. This study evaluated the application of using catalytic ozonation to treat alumina refinery condensate in order to remove the potential emission of odourous compounds from the industrial wastewater. The technical challenges in treating the alumina refinery condensate are the high pH and temperatures of the wastewater effluent (over 80 \u00b0C and pH above 10) due the industrial process. The odour removal efficiencies for different catalysts (FeCl(3), MnO, and MnSO(4)) under experimental conditions in terms of controlled pH, temperature and ozone dosage were determined before and after ozone treatment using dynamic olfactometry. The result demonstrated that the addition of both FeCl(3) and MnO catalysts improved odour removal efficiencies during the ozonation of alumina condensates at similar pH and temperature conditions. FeCl(3) and MnO had similar enhancement for odour removal, however MnO was determined to be more appropriate than MnSO(4) for odour removal due to the colouration of the treated condensate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xinguang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stuetz", "ForeName": "Richard M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22907465", "10.2166/wst.2012.391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
