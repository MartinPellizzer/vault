Rivers contain many biopersistent organic compounds such as humic acid, lignin, and gum arabic. Free radicals generated by self-decomposition of ozone were used as powerful oxidants to split organic compounds. Ozonysis of the samples was carried out by 42.4 gN(-1)m(-3) ozone for 3 min at pH 7.0. Artificial wastewater (AWW) solutions were employed as standard solutions for the calibrations of the BOD sensor. At a BOD of 1 mgl(-1), the sensor response after ozonation was 1.6-fold higher than that before ozonation. The response time of the BOD sensor was only 5min, being independent of the concentrations, and the lower detection limit was 0.5 mgl(-1) BOD. The degradations of lignin and tannic acid by ozonation were 54.1 and 42.3%, respectively. In the biosensor responses by ozonation, lignin, gum arabic, and surfactant increased by double or more compared with previous responses. BOD in rivers was estimated using the stopped-flow system. Environmental samples pretreated with ozone gave high responses to the biosensor that were similar to those of the conventional BOD(5) method. Accordingly, a good correlation between the sensor and the conventional BOD(5) was obtained (r=0.989). The system has to evolve the highly sensitive BOD determination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Extremobiosphere Research Center, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, 2-15 Natsushima Yokosuka 237-0061, Japan. cheegj@jamstec.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chee", "ForeName": "Gab-Joo", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nomura", "ForeName": "Yoko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikebukuro", "ForeName": "Kazunori", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karube", "ForeName": "Isao", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosens Bioelectron", "NlmUniqueID": "9001289", "ISSNLinking": "0956-5663"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biosensing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17320372", "10.1016/j.bios.2007.01.014", "S0956-5663(07)00034-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
