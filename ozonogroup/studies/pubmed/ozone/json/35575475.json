Herein, we demonstrate a self-aligned fabrication process based on self-terminated p-doping and layer-by-layer chemical etching to achieve low contact resistance as well as a high on/off current ratio in ultrathin tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) field-effect transistors (FETs). Damage-free layer-by-layer thinning of the WSe<sub>2</sub> channel is repeated up to a thickness of approximately 1.4 nm, while maintaining the selectively p-doped source/drain regions. The device characteristics of the recessed-channel WSe<sub>2</sub> FET are systematically monitored during this layer-by-layer recess-channel process. The WSe<sub>2</sub> etching rate is estimated to be 2-3 layers per cycle of oxidation and subsequent chemical etching. The self-terminated tungsten oxide (WO<sub>X</sub>) layer grown through ultraviolet-ozone treatment induces robust p-doping in the neighboring (or underlying) WSe<sub>2</sub> through the electron withdrawal mechanism, which remains in the source/drain regions after channel oxide removal. The adopted self-terminated and self-aligned recess-channel process for ultrathin WSe<sub>2</sub> FETs enables the realization of a high on/off output current ratio (>10<sup>8</sup>) and field-effect mobility (\u223c190 cm<sup>2</sup>/V\u00b7s), while maintaining low contact resistance (0.9-6.1 k\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm) without a postannealing process. The proposed facile and reproducible doping and atomic-layer-etching method for the fabrication of a recessed-channel FET with an ultrathin body can be helpful for high-performance two-dimensional semiconductor devices and is applicable to post-Si complementary metal-oxide semiconductor devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dongryul", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yongha", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Junghun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5634-8394"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jihyun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35575475", "10.1021/acsnano.2c03402"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
