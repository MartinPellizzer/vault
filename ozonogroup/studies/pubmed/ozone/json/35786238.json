This review narrates the possible use of novel cell disruption techniques, including use of ionic liquid, deep eutectic solvent, surfactant, switchable solvents, high voltage electrical discharge, explosive decompression, compressional-puffing, plasma, and ozonation, which can enable the recovery of value added substances from macro-microalgae, complying with the principles of green chemistry and sustainability. The above-mentioned innovative techniques are reviewed with respect to their working principles, benefits, and possible applications for macro-microalgae bioactive compound recovery and biofuel. The benefits of these techniques compared to conventional extraction methods include shorter extraction time, improved yield, and reduced cost. Furthermore, various combinations of these innovative technologies are used for the extraction of thermolabile bioactive compounds. The challenges and prospects of the innovative extraction processes for the forthcoming improvement of environmentally and cost-effective macro-microalgal biorefineries are also explained in this review."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5019-8348"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Chemistry and Technology, Teagasc Food Research Centre, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Saravana", "ForeName": "Periaswamy Sivagnanam", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Chemistry and Technology, Teagasc Food Research Centre, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Ummat", "ForeName": "Viruja", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Bourke", "ForeName": "Paula", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Chemistry and Technology, Teagasc Food Research Centre, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Brijesh K", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Microalgae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35786238", "10.1080/07388551.2022.2089869"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
