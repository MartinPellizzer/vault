The concentration levels of target pesticides in raw waters ranged from below the limit of quantification (<LOQ) to 2391.3\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, whereas in finished waters significantly decreased to a range of <LOQ to 269\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. The application of the advanced treatment process could effectively remove target pesticides. For example, the highest removal of isocarbophos after the advanced treatment process reached 94.6%, whereas its removal after the conventional treatment process was just 42.6%. The estimated daily intake level of target pesticides in finished water, which were pretty lower than acceptable daily intake levels in finished water, could be reduced by 67% if combining the conventional and advanced treatment processes. Although the multiple pesticides in raw waters were effectively removed by advanced treatment process, their synergistic toxic effects induced by the residual pesticides and their degradation by-products on human health deserve further attentions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
