Jarvis-type multiplicative model has been recommended for estimating stomatal ozone flux in forest trees. Ozone can change stomatal conductance by both stomatal closure and less efficient stomatal control (stomatal sluggishness). However, current Jarvis-type models do not account for these ozone effects on stomatal conductance in forest trees. We examined seasonal course of stomatal conductance in two common deciduous tree species native to northern Japan (white birch: Betula platyphylla var. japonica; deciduous oak: Quercus mongolica var. crispula) grown under free-air ozone exposure. We innovatively considered stomatal sluggishness in the Jarvis-type model using a simple parameter, s, relating to cumulative ozone uptake (defined as POD: phytotoxic ozone dose). We found that ozone decreased stomatal conductance of white birch leaves after full expansion (-28%). However, such a reduction of stomatal conductance by ozone fell in late summer (-10%). At the same time, ozone reduced stomatal sensitivity of white birch to VPD and increased stomatal conductance under low light conditions. In contrast, in deciduous oak, ozone did not clearly change the model parameters. The consideration of both ozone-induced stomatal closure and stomatal sluggishness improved the model performance to estimate stomatal conductance and to explain the dose-response relationship on ozone-induced decline of photosynthesis of white birch. Our results indicate that ozone effects on stomatal conductance (i.e. stomatal closure and stomatal sluggishness) are crucial for modelling studies to determine stomatal response in deciduous trees, especially in species sensitive to ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sustainable Plant Protection, National Research Council of Italy, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5263-2945"], "LastName": "Hoshika", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sustainable Plant Protection, National Research Council of Italy, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carrari", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sustainable Plant Protection, National Research Council of Italy, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paoletti", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Silviculture and Forest Ecological Studies, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28941031", "10.1111/plb.12632"]}}]}
