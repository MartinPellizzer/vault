Hypospadias not only impairs the sexual function of infants but also causes major social and psychological problems during their growth period, therefore, the prevention and treatment of hypospadias infant carry substantial public health importance. However, the association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and hypospadias remains controversial. The study reviews the epidemiological research progress and potential biological mechanisms of prenatal maternal exposure to air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and the risk of hypospadias in offspring. The study also summarizes the limitations of previous research and looks forward to future research directions, to provide scientific evidence for creating a healthy living environment for pregnant women, and reducing the risk of hypospadias in offspring."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Women's Hospital, School of Medicine Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Z C", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "X M", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China Women's Hospital, School of Medicine Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2020-18", "Agency": "Zhejiang Province Health Innovation Talent Training Programme", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypospadias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "49"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39034795", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20240126-00095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
