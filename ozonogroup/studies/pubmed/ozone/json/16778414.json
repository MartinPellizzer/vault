R(L) increased significantly after histamine inhalation both in the control and the ozone-exposed groups. The threshold of histamine (PC(200)) in the ozone-exposed group was significantly lower than that in the control group. A significant swelling of the epithelial cells after histamine inhalation was observed both in the control and the ozone-exposed groups, with a greater increase in the ozone-exposed group compared with the control group. However, no change in wall thickness was observed in the histamine/antihistamine or the ozone/histamine/antihistamine group.", "Our results suggest the possibility that the airway epithelial cell swelling plays a role in the increase in R(L) after histamine inhalation, especially in the presence of airway inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muramatsu", "ForeName": "Reiko", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mochizuki", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arakawa", "ForeName": "Hirokazu", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokuyama", "ForeName": "Kenichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morikawa", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Respiration", "NlmUniqueID": "0137356", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7931"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16778414", "10.1159/000093932", "93932"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
