Therefore, in this work, simulated UV-B radiation was used to study the effects of elevated UV-B radiation on root growth of soybean seedlings and changes in the content of signaling molecules in roots. The results showed that compared with the control, the 2.63\u202fkJ\u202fm<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and 6.17\u202fkJ\u202fm<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> elevated UV-B radiation treatments inhibited root growth, and root growth parameters (total root length, root surface area, root volume, average diameter, root tip number, and root dry weight) all decreased. For root signaling molecules, the content of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid increased, and the content of auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin decreased. The above indices changed more significantly under the 6.17\u202fkJ\u202fm<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> treatment. After withdrawal of the exposure, the above indices could be restored to a certain extent. These data indicated that UV-B radiation interfered with root growth by affecting the content of signaling molecules in roots, and the degree of the effects was related to the intensity of UV-B radiation. The results from this study provide a theoretical basis for studying the preliminary mechanism of elevated UV-B radiation on root growth and possible pathways that can mitigate UV-B radiation damage for root growth. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: The effects of elevated UV-B on root growth of soybean seedlings were regulated by signaling molecules, and the degree of the effects was related to the intensity of UV-B radiation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
