Not only marine organisms but also marine ecosystems can be affected by enhanced UV-B radiation. The effects of UV-B radiation on interaction of macro-algae and micro-algae were investigated using Ulva pertusa Kjellman and Alexandrium tamarense as the materials in this study. The results demonstrated that UV-B radiation could inhibit the growth of Ulva pertusa and Alexandrium tamarense when they were both mono-cultured, and the growth inhibition of algae was more significant with increasing doses of UV-B radiation. Alexandrium tamarense could inhibit the growth of Ulva pertusa in mixed culture, and the growth inhibition was more significant when increasing the initial cell density. However, Ulva pertusa could inhibit the growth of Alexandrium tamarense in early phase and stimulate the growth in latter phase when they were grown in mixed culture. Lower initial cell density (10(2) cell/ml) of Alexandrium tamarense could inhibit the growth of Ulva pertusa under UV-B radiation treatment, however, with the initial cell density increasing (10(3) and 10(4) cell/ml), the growth of Ulva pertusa was stimulated under lower dose of UV-B radiation and inhibited under higher dose of UV-B radiation by Alexandrium tamarense. Compared with that in mixed culture, Ulva pertusa showed more positive inhibition to the growth of Alexandrium tamarense under UV-B radiation treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine Ecology Laboratory, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "C ai", "ForeName": "Heng-Jiang", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xue-Xi", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pei-Yu", "Initials": "PY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoflagellida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ulva"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16158588"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
