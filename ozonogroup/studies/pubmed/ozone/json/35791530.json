Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which accounts for 15%-20% of particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Here, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, VOCs, and trace gases were monitored by using online instruments in Jiyuan from December 1<sup>st</sup> to 31<sup>st</sup>. The characteristics, sources, and secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP) of VOCs were analyzed. The mean concentrations of TVOC were (54.3\u00b127.5)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Alkanes, halocarbons, and alkynes were the predominant VOCs. The positive matrix factorization model was used to identify and apportion VOCs sources. Eight major sources of VOCs were identified, which included liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (NG), the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) industry, vehicular exhaust, the coking industry, solvent usage, industry, technological process, and fuel evaporation. The SOAP of aromatics was the largest. Among them, BTEXs were the dominant contributors to SOAP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Jiyuan Ecological Environment Testing Center, Jiyuan 459000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Jiyuan Ecological Environment Testing Center, Jiyuan 459000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Xia", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Jiyuan Ecological Environment Testing Center, Jiyuan 459000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Guo", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Jiyuan Ecological Environment Testing Center, Jiyuan 459000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zong-Sheng", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Jiyuan Ecological Environment Testing Center, Jiyuan 459000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35791530", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202109153"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
