To achieve this, this study proposed an LCA method specifically applicable to the Korean concrete industry by adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations. The proposed LCA method involves a system that performs environmental impact assessment on the basis of input information on concrete mix design, transport distance, and energy consumption in a batch plant. The Concrete Lifecycle Assessment System (CLAS) thus developed provides user-friendly support for environmental impact assessment with specialized database for concrete mix materials and energy sources. In the case analysis using the CLAS, among the substances discharged from the production of 24 MPa concrete, those contributing to GWP, AP, EP, ADP, ODP, and POCP were assessed to amount to 309 kg-CO\u2082 eq/m\u00b3, 28.7 kg-SO\u2082 eq/m\u00b3, 5.21 kg-PO\u2084<sup>3-</sup> eq/m\u00b3, 0.000049 kg-CFC<sub>11</sub> eq/m\u00b3, 34 kg/m\u00b3, and 21 kg-Ethylene eq/m\u00b3, respectively. Of these six environmental impact categories selected for the LCA in this study, ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was found to contribute most intensely to GWP and POCP, and aggregates, to AP, EP, ODP, and ADP. It was also found that the mix design with increased prop proportion of recycled aggregate was found to contribute to reducing the impact in all other categories."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Building and Urban Research Institute, Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, Daehwa-dong 283, Goyandae-Ro, ILsanseo-Gu, Goyang-Si 10223, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea. kimtaehyoung@kict.re.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Tae Hyoung", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture & Architectural Engineering, Hanyang University, 1271 Sa 3-dong, Sangrok-Gu, Ansan-Si 15588, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea. jnb55@hanyang.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Tae", "ForeName": "Sung Ho", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101238455", "ISSNLinking": "1660-4601"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Construction Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Construction Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Building Research Establishment .
