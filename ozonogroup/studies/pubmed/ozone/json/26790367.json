We show that adsorption of oxygen and ozone under ambient conditions results in subtantial doping and corresponding enhancement in the hole conductivity of the devices. Ozone-induced doping is found to be rapid and efficient, saturating within minutes of exposure whereas oxygen-induced doping occurs over a period of days to reach the equivalent level of doping. Our observations reveal that the water adlayer on the material surface plays a crucial role in solubilizing oxygen and ozone and in forming a redox couple with a large chemical potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore 117542. g.eda@nus.edu.sg."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shunfeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore 117542. g.eda@nus.edu.sg."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Weijie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore 117542. g.eda@nus.edu.sg."}], "LastName": "Giustiniano", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore 117542. g.eda@nus.edu.sg and Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, Singapore 117543 and Centre for Advanced 2D Materials, National University of Singapore, 6 Science Drive 2, Singapore 117546."}], "LastName": "Eda", "ForeName": "Goki", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26790367", "10.1039/c5cp07194a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
