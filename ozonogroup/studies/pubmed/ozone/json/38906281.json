However, managing the reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) characterized by high salinity and increased concentrations of organic matter is challenging. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the enhancement effects and mechanisms of pre-ozonation on organic matter removal efficacy in ROC using a biological activated carbon (BAC) system. Our findings revealed that during the stable operation phase, the ozonation (O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/granular activated carbon)-BAC system removes 43.6-72.2\u00a0% of dissolved organic carbon, achieving a 4-7 fold increase in efficiency compared with that in the BAC system alone. Through dynamic analysis of influent and effluent water quality, biofilm performance, and microbial community structure, succession, and function prediction, we elucidated the following primary enhancement mechanisms: 1) pre-ozonation significantly enhances the biodegradability of ROC by 4.5-6 times and diminishes the organic load on the BAC system; 2) pre-ozonation facilitates the selective enrichment of microbes capable of degrading organic compounds in the BAC system, thereby enhancing the biodegradation capacity and stability of the microbial community; and 3) pre-ozonation accelerates the regeneration rate of the granular activated carbon adsorption sites. Collectively, our findings provide valuable insights into treating ROC through pre-oxidation combined with biotreatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
