Chemical additions ranged from individual compounds (<i>e.g.</i>, gaseous ammonia or ozone) to more complex mixtures (<i>e.g.</i>, a wildfire smoke proxy and a commercial pesticide). Physical perturbations included varying temperature, ventilation rates, and relative humidity. The objectives for CASA included understanding (i) how outdoor air pollution impacts indoor air chemistry, (ii) how wildfire smoke transports and transforms indoors, (iii) how gases and particles interact with building surfaces, and (iv) how indoor environmental conditions impact indoor chemistry. Further, the combined measurements under unperturbed and experimental conditions enable investigation of mitigation strategies following outdoor and indoor air pollution events. A comprehensive suite of instruments measured different chemical components in the gas, particle, and surface phases throughout the study. We provide an overview of the test house, instrumentation, experimental design, and initial observations - including the role of humidity in controlling the air concentrations of many semi-volatile organic compounds, the potential for ozone to generate indoor nitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), the differences in microbial composition between the test house and other occupied buildings, and the complexity of deposited particles and gases on different indoor surfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6470-9970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.
