The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the health risks of VOCs emitted by the carbon industry. The results showed that the concentration of VOCs in the production areas of the three research enterprises was between 89.77-964.60 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the management area was between 51.46-121.59 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Naphthalene and carbon disulfide were at the highest concentrations in the carbon plants. The ozone formation potential of VOCs in the production area was between 75.42-1416.73 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and in the management area was between 65.32-202.42 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, mainly from the contribution of aromatic hydrocarbons and olefins. The carcinogenic health risk (Risk) of VOCs in the production area was 3.5\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>-2.8\u00d710<sup>-3</sup>, and in the management area was 2.0\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>-9.4\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>, which was higher than the maximum acceptable level recommended by the EPA (10<sup>-6</sup>). The non-carcinogenic health risk index (HI) of the VOCs in the production area was 3.2-1.4\u00d710<sup>2</sup>, and in the management area was 4.3\u00d710<sup>-1</sup>-3.8, except for the management area of the first enterprise, which was greater than 1, which may expose the workers. These health factors cause cancer and non-carcinogenic hazards."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi-Shun", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Rui-Dong", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yong-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Meng-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qing-Yan", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Qi-She", "Initials": "QS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854550", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201905048"]}}]}
