These lipid regulators could be effectively removed by solar/chlorine treatment, and their corresponding pseudo-first-order rate constants (k') increased with increasing chlorine dosage. The degradation of GFRZ and BZF was primarily ascribed to reactive chlorine species (RCS) and ozone, while that of CA was mainly attributable to hydroxyl radical (HO) and ozone. As pH rose from 5.0 to 8.4, k<sub>ozone</sub>' of GFRZ and BZF increased, while k<sub>HO</sub>' decreased. However, k<sub>RCS</sub>' of GFRZ increased by 130%, while that of BZF decreased by 43.3%. These changes resulted in slight changes in the overall k's with increasing pH. k's of GFRZ, BZF, and CA by solar/chorine treatment were inhibited by natural organic matter (NOM) while the presence of bromide enhanced the degradation of GFRZ by solar/chlorine process. The degradation of lipid regulators was still effective in a secondary wastewater effluent sample and a sand-filtered water sample, although that was inhibited due to the dissolve organic matter (DOM) contained in real waters. The acute toxicity during the degradation of GFRZ by solar/chlorine treatment was comparable to that by treatment with chlorine alone. This study demonstrated that RCS played an important role in the degradation of micropollutants by the solar/chlorine treatment and the feasibility of solar/chlorine process in the application for the degradation of organic compounds in real waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
