In order to understand whether factors that lead to susceptibility to ozone are also important in silicosis or not, we examined ozone-sensitive C57BL/6J mice and ozone-resistant C3H/HeJ mice as models of silicosis. We also analyzed the production of proinflammatory cytokines in both the acute and the chronic phases. On Day 2 after silica injection, the ozone-resistant C3H/HeJ mice showed significantly higher cellular responses as recognized by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts than did the C57BL/6J mice. In the chronic phase (Day 28 after silica injection), the ozone-sensitive C57BL/6J mice showed significantly greater responses to instilled silica judged by total protein and cell number in BAL fluid, hydroxyproline content, and histology than the ozone-resistant C3H/HeJ mice. TNF-alpha production by BAL cells after silica exposure was significantly higher in C57BL/6J mice than in C3H/HeJ mice in the chronic phase, whereas there was no significant difference in IL-1 alpha production between both strains of silica-injected mice. Also, the control C57BL/6J mice had significantly higher secretions of TNF-alpha than did the control C3H/HeJ mice in the acute phase. These results suggest that ozone-sensitive C57BL/6J mice are also more susceptible to silicosis than are ozone-resistant C3H/HeJ mice, and that the initial lower cellular responses and increase in TNF-alpha production may be related to the higher level of inflammatory and fibrotic response in the C57BL/6J mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Medicine and Medical Center, School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohtsuka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Munakata", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ukita", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satoh", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawakami", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Susceptibility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Silicosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8520788", "10.1164/ajrccm.152.6.8520788"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
