It is an effective bactericide in its gaseous as well as aqueous form.", "The objective of this study was to determine the in-situ antimicrobial effect of 0.1 ppm ozonated water on plaque and salivary microorganisms.", "24 h old supragingival plaque (SP) was collected from the two most posterior teeth in the contralateral quadrants before and after a 30 s rinse with either distilled water (control group) or 0.1 ppm ozonated water (test group). Simultaneously stimulated whole saliva (SWS) was collected for both groups. The SP and SWS were stained with LIVE/DEAD Baclight Bacteria Viability fluorescent kit to visualize live and dead microbes. The salivary flow rate, calcium and protein level were also determined in the pre- and post-rinsed samples. The data obtained was subjected to One Way ANOVA test using Minitab 14 statistical software (PA, USA).", "0.1 ppm ozonated water was found effective in reducing the bacterial load in both the 24 h plaque and SWS samples, but it did not eliminate them completely. In addition, there was no statistically significant effect of the ozonated water rinse on the salivary flow rate, salivary calcium and protein concentration.", "0.1 ppm ozonated water rinse can be an effective adjunct to tooth brushing and flossing to maintain plaque and salivary bacterial load."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maxillofacial Surgery and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Dentistry, King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Sadatullah", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Practice, Faculty of Dentistry, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Nh", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Biology, Faculty of Dentistry, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Razak", "ForeName": "Fa", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Ann Med Health Sci Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101585351", "ISSNLinking": "2141-9248"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sbordone L, Bortolaia C.
