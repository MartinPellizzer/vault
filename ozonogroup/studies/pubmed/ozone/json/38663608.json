However, the characteristics of VOC emissions from vehicles with strict emission limits are poorly understood. This study investigated the VOC emission characteristics from vehicles under the latest standards based on tunnel measurements, and identified future control strategies for vehicle emissions. The results showed that the highest percentage of VOCs from vehicle consisted of alkanes (80.9\u00a0%), followed by aromatics (15.8\u00a0%) and alkenes (3.1\u00a0%). Alkanes had the most significant ozone formation potential due to their high concentrations, in contrast to the aromatics that have been dominant in previous studies. The measured fleet-average VOC emission factor was 71.3\u00a0mg\u00b7km<sup>-1</sup>, including tailpipe emissions of 39.6\u00a0mg\u00b7km<sup>-1</sup> and evaporative emissions of 31.7\u00a0mg\u00b7km<sup>-1</sup>. The VOC emission factors of the subgroups were obtained. The emission of evaporated VOCs accounted for 44.5\u00a0% of the total vehicle VOC emissions, which have increased substantially from previous studies. In addition, the emission characteristics of vehicles that are under the latest emission threshold values have changed significantly, and the mixing ratio of toluene/benzene (T/B) has been updated to 3:1. This study updates the VOCs emission factors of vehicles under clean air actions and highlights the future mitigation policies should focus on reducing evaporative VOC emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
