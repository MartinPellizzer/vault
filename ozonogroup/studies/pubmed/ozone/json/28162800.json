To accomplish this objective, we analyzed the response of photosynthetic parameters such as maximum carboxylation rate (V<sub>cmax</sub>) to cumulative stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake (\u03a3F<sub>st</sub>) and reduction rate of V<sub>cmax</sub> per unit \u03a3F<sub>st</sub> as an index of detoxification capacity for O<sub>3</sub>. The seedlings of Fagus crenata were grown for two growing seasons (2014-2015) in nine treatments comprised of a combination of three levels of gas treatments (charcoal-filtered air or 1.0- or 1.5-times ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration) and three levels of soil nutrient treatments (non-fertilized or a supply of relatively low or high concentrations of compound fertilizer). The nutrient supply significantly increased the degree of O<sub>3</sub>-induced reduction in V<sub>cmax</sub> in September. However, nutrient supply did not significantly increase \u03a3F<sub>st</sub> and reduce the detoxification capacity for O<sub>3</sub>. On the other hand, the degree of O<sub>3</sub>-induced reduction in V<sub>cmax</sub> of upper canopy leaves was higher as compared with that of lower canopy leaves in August due to the higher \u03a3F<sub>st</sub>. However, the reduction rate of V<sub>cmax</sub> per unit \u03a3F<sub>st</sub> in lower canopy leaves was higher than that in upper canopy leaves, indicating lower detoxification capacity for O<sub>3</sub> in lower canopy leaves. Reduction rate of V<sub>cmax</sub> per unit \u03a3F<sub>st</sub> over the threshold, which is assumed to be proportional to gross photosynthetic rate, was similar between upper and lower canopy leaves. Therefore, capacity of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation is likely to be associated with detoxification capacity for O<sub>3</sub> in upper and lower canopy leaves of F. crenata seedlings grown under different soil nutrient conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
