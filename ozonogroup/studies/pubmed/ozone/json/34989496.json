Composition characteristics, diurnal variation, and atmospheric chemical reactivity of VOCs were analyzed. The results showed that <i>\u03c6</i>(total VOCs) were the highest before the COVID-19 pandemic in different sites and the lowest during the first response period. The <i>\u03c6</i>(total VOCs) at night was higher than that during the day. The daily variation in Wolongqiao <i>\u03c6</i>(total VOCs) was less than that in Xiasha. The daily variation in <i>\u03c6</i>(total VOCs) during the first level response period was less than that during the other three periods. The diurnal variation in the <i>\u03c6</i> (total VOCs) in Xiasha showed a \"V\" shape, and that in Wolongqiao showed a typical bimodal structure. The OFP in Xiasha was higher than that in Wolongqiao. The OFP were the highest at the two sites before the COVID-19 pandemic. The OFP was the lowest during the first response period in Xiasha and the lowest during the second response period in Wolongqiao. The OFP of aromatics and olefins was higher, and the OFP of alkynes was the lowest in Xiasha. The OFP of olefin in Wolongqiao was much higher than that of the other three components, followed by alkane and alkyne."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ren-Chang", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Jia-Jia", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Kai-Er", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Ji-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34989496", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202103202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
