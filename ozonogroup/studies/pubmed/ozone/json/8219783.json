The animals had been immunized intraperitoneally with a mixture of Ascaris suum extract and silica gel, and exposed to ozone. They were then challenged with an oral dose of A. suum extract (6 mg/kg), and respiratory resistance (Rrs) was measured up to 7 h. After oral administration of the allergen, an increase in Rrs was observed. The mean values at 1, 3, 5 and 7 h after oral allergen challenge were 150 +/- 21, 149 +/- 11, 151 +/- 12 and 134 +/- 10% of the baseline value, respectively. When saline instead of the allergen was orally administered, almost no significant increase in Rrs was observed up to 7 h. Moreover, in nonsensitized guinea pigs, oral administration of allergen produced no significant increase in Rrs for up to 7 h. When atropine was administered as an aerosol, the increase in Rrs induced by an oral allergen challenge was attenuated. Three of the five atropine-treated guinea pigs showed temporary increases in Rrs immediately after the oral allergen challenge. The mean values of Rrs in the atropine-treated animals challenged with oral allergen at 1, 3, 5 and 7 h were 106 +/- 3, 106 +/- 5, 115 +/- 5 and 102 +/- 4% of baseline value, respectively. In the animals which received oral allergen, the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) significantly increased 2.0-fold (p < 0.05), while no significant increase in the number of eosinophils, macrophages, or lymphocytes in BALF was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aratani", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichinose", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takishima", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int Arch Allergy Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9211652", "ISSNLinking": "1018-2438"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascaris suum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstriction"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8219783", "10.1159/000236540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
