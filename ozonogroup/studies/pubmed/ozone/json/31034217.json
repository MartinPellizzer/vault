This study estimates the impacts of the leak on transient weather, climate, air quality, and health in California and the Los Angeles Basin using a nested global-through-local weather-climate-air quality computer model. Results suggest that the Aliso Canyon leak may have increased the mixing ratios of multiple emitted hydrocarbon gases throughout California. Subsequent gas-phase photochemistry increased the mixing ratios of additional byproducts, including carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and ozone. Increases in air temperatures aloft and lesser increases at the surface due to thermal-infrared radiation absorption by methane stabilized the air over much of California, slightly reducing clouds, precipitation, and near-surface wind speed with greater reductions in Los Angeles than in California. The reduction in precipitation, in particular, increased PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration, with a greater increase in Los Angeles than in California. The higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased estimated premature mortality in California by +32 (9-54) to +43 (15-66), depending on the set of relative risks used. Despite higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Los Angeles due to the leak, premature mortalities there were more ambiguous, ranging from a mean decrease of -7 to a mean increase of +15, for 2 simulations with different resolution and boundary conditions. The remaining mortalities occurred in the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay Area. Ozone premature mortalities away from the leak increased by <1. The study did not evaluate potential health impacts, including cancers, immediately near the leak. As such, the Aliso Canyon leak affected temperatures, pollution, and health throughout California. Future leaks will also likely have impacts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Stanford University , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacobson", "ForeName": "Mark Z", "Initials": "MZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Natural Gas"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Natural Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "San Francisco"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31034217", "10.1021/acs.est.9b01495"]}}]}
