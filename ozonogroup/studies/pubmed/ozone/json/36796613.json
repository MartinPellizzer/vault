This work studied the changes and internal influencing mechanisms of ecotoxicity and the capacity for inducing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) shown by the tetracycline (TC) degradation products generated in AOPs with differential free radicals. Under the action of superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen in the ozone system, and sulfate and hydroxyl radicals in the thermally activated potassium persulfate system, TC exhibited differential degradation pathways and resulted in the differential growth inhibition trends on the determined strains. Microcosm experiments combined with metagenomics were also performed to analyze the remarkable changes in the TC resistance genes tetA (60), tetT, and otr(B) induced by the degradation products and ARG hosts in the natural water environment. Microcosm experiments exhibited that the microbial community in actual water have changed significantly with the addition of TC and degradation intermediates. Furthermore, the richness of genes related to oxidative stress was investigated to discuss the effect on reactive oxygen species production and SOS response caused by TC and its intermediates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
