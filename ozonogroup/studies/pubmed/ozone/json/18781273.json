In this paper, an enrichment experiment with open-top chamber was conducted to examine the effects of elevated CO(2), O(3), and their combination on the contents of total phenolic compounds and flavone in the leaves of spring wheat (C(3) crop) and maize (C(4) crop). The results showed for spring wheat, the total phenolic contents in its leaves at jointing stage was significantly higher under elevated CO(2) and/or O(3), with the sequence of CO(2) plus O(3) > O(3) > CO(2) > ambient, while at grain-filling stage, the total phenolic content was lower under CO(2) plus O(3) than under CO(2), O(3), and ambient. The total phenolic content in maize leaves at jointing stage had the similar variation trend with that for wheat, but at grain-filling stage, the total phenolic content was slightly affected by elevated CO(2) and/or O(3). The flavone content in spring wheat leaves was significantly lower under CO(2) and/or O(3) stress at jointing stage, but had lesser difference at grain-filling stage under the stress. The same variation trend was observed in the flavone content in maize leaves at jointing and grainfilling stages, i.e., CO(2) plus O(3) > CO(2) > ambient > O(3). C(3) plant was more sensitive than C(4) plant to the CO(2) and/or O(3) stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Ecological Process, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guomei", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18781273", "10.1007/s00128-008-9516-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
