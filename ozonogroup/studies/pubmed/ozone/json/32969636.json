It is empirically known that the nitrification activity of BAC filters depends on water temperature, potentially resulting in the leakage of ammonium from BAC filters when the water temperature decreases. However, the ammonium removal capacity of BAC filters and factors governing the capacity remain unknown. This study employed a bench-scale column assay to determine the volumetric ammonium removal rate (VARR) of BAC collected from a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. VARR was determined at a fixed loading rate under different conditions. Seasonal variations of the VARR as well as impacts of the water matrix and water temperature on ammonium removal were quantitatively analyzed. While the VARR in an inorganic medium at 25 \u00b0C was maintained even during low water temperature periods and during breakpoint chlorination periods, the water matrix factor reduced the VARR in ozonated water at 25 \u00b0C by 33% on average. The VARR in ozonated water was dependent on water temperature, indicating that the microbial activity of BAC did not adapt to low water temperature. The Arrhenius equation was applied to reveal the relationship between VARR and water temperature. The actual ammonium removal performance of a full-scale BAC filter was predicted. VARR is useful for water engineers to reexamine the loading and filter depth of BAC filters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan."}], "LastName": "Jantarakasem", "ForeName": "Chotiwat", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4392-3756"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kasuga", "ForeName": "Ikuro", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1567-4852"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kurisu", "ForeName": "Futoshi", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Water Environment Technology, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan."}], "LastName": "Furumai", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32969636", "10.1021/acs.est.0c02502"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
