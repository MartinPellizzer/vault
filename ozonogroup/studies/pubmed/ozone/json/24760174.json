The drain-source current of these transistors initially increases with ozone exposure and then it progressively decreases with increasing exposure beyond 3 min. This non-monotonic dependence of the drain-source current can be ascribed to two competing processes. At short ozone exposure, p-doping of carbon nanotubes dominates; the drain-source current thus increases as a result of increasing hole concentration. This effect is most evidenced in a progressive threshold voltage shift towards positive voltages with increasing exposure to ozone. At extended ozone exposure, chemical oxidation of carbon nanotubes instead dominates. The drain-source current decreases as a result of decreasing hole mobility. This effect manifests itself in a monotonic decrease in the mobility of these devices as a function of ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA. lloo@princeton.edu."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Loo", "ForeName": "Yueh-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24760174", "10.1039/c4cp00665h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
