They mainly include ferrous salts, zero-valent iron, iron-metal composites, iron sulfides, iron oxyhydroxides, iron oxides, and supported iron-based catalysts, which have been widely applied in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, there is lack of a comprehensive review systematically reporting their synthesis, characterization, and applications. It is imperative to evaluate the catalytic performances of various Fe-based catalysts in diverse AOPs systems and reveal the activation mechanisms of different oxidants by Fe-based catalysts. This work detailedly summarizes the synthesis methods and characterization technologies of Fe-based catalysts. This paper critically evaluates the catalytic performances of Fe-based catalysts in diverse AOPs systems. The effects of solution pH, reaction temperature, coexisting ions, oxidant concentration, catalyst dosage, and external energy on the degradation of organic contaminants in the Fe-based catalyst/oxidant systems and the stability of Fe-based catalysts are also discussed. The activation mechanisms of various oxidants and the degradation pathways of organic contaminants in the Fe-based catalyst/oxidant systems are revealed by a series of novel detection methods and characterization technologies. Future research prospects on the potential preparation means of Fe-based catalysts, practical applications, assistive technologies, and impact in AOPs are proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
