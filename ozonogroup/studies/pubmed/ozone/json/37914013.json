The emergence of an effective, realistic, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable technique to treat wastewater generated from different sectors is critical for reducing pollutant accumulation in the environment. The electrochemical advanced oxidation method is a productive technology for treating hazardous effluents because of its potential benefits such as lack of secondary pollutant and high oxidation efficiency. Recent researches on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in the period of 2018-2022 are highlighted in this paper. This review emphasizes on recent advances in electro-oxidation (EO), ozone oxidation, sonolysis, radiation, electro-Fenton (EF), photolysis and photocatalysis targeted at treating pharmaceuticals, dyes and pesticides polluted effluents. In the first half of the review, the concept of the AOPs are discussed briefly. Later, the influence of increasing current density, pH, electrode, electrolyte and initial concentration of effluents on degradation are discussed. Lastly, previously reported designs of electrochemical reactors, as well as data on intermediates generated and energy consumption during the electro oxidation and Fenton processes are discussed. According to the literature study, the electro-oxidation technique is more appropriate for organic compounds, whilst the electro-Fenton technique appear to be more appropriate for more complex molecules."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
