RA was induced by administration of collagenase plus complete Freud's adjuvant in the knee joint region. The animals were treated with ozone therapy (1\u00a0ml O<sub>3</sub> injection in the knee i.a.) according to group assignment: T12, 2\u00a0h; T48, 2 and 24\u00a0h; and T72, 2, 24, and 48\u00a0h post-RA induction. The different animal groups were euthanized 12, 24, or 72\u00a0h post-RA induction, respectively. Synovial exudate levels of IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, and MCP-1 were assessed by flow cytometry, and histopathological analysis of the knee cartilage was conducted. Ozone therapy effectively decreases inflammation, reducing IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1, and increasing IL10. O<sub>3</sub> did not statistically affect INF-\u03b3 or MCP-1 levels. More expressive results were obtained with group T72, i.e., treated 2, 24, and 48\u00a0h post-RA induction, which indicates that longer-term ozone treatment is more effective than a single acute application. Ozone therapy effectively reduced inflammation with effects, at least in part, mediated through reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology, State University of the Central West of Paran\u00e1-Unicentro, Guarapuava, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Tartari", "ForeName": "Ana Paula Santos", "Initials": "APS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6625-4084"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology, State University of the Central West of Paran\u00e1-Unicentro, Guarapuava, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Felipe Figueiredo", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology, State University of the Central West of Paran\u00e1-Unicentro, Guarapuava, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "M\u00e1rio C\u00e9sar Da Silva", "Initials": "MCDS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Molecular Biology, State University of the Central West of Paran\u00e1-Unicentro, Guarapuava, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Carraro", "ForeName": "Emerson", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Experimental Neuroscience Laboratory (LaNEx), University of Southern Santa Catarina, Palho\u00e7a, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Palho\u00e7a, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Cidral-Filho", "ForeName": "Francisco Jos\u00e9", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Experimental Neuroscience Laboratory (LaNEx), University of Southern Santa Catarina, Palho\u00e7a, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Palho\u00e7a, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Salgado", "ForeName": "Afonso Inoue", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology, State University of the Central West of Paran\u00e1-Unicentro, Guarapuava, Brazil. ikerppers@hotmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": ", Guarapuava, Brazil. ikerppers@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kerppers", "ForeName": "Ivo Ilvan", "Initials": "II"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inflammation", "NlmUniqueID": "7600105", "ISSNLinking": "0360-3997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-81-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Freund's Adjuvant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Freund's Adjuvant"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32382842", "10.1007/s10753-020-01184-2", "10.1007/s10753-020-01184-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
