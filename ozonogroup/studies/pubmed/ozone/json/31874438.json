For the first time, yield and economic losses of wheat between 2014 and 2017 were estimated for the North China Plain (NCP) using observational hourly O<sub>3</sub> data from 312 monitoring stations and exposure-response functions based on AOT40 index (accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration above 40\u00a0ppb) from a Chinese study. AOT40 values from 2014 to 2017 during the wheat growing seasons (75-days, 44 before and 30 after mid-anthesis) ranged from 3.1 to 14.9\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 4.9-17.5\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 7.3-17.6\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, and 0.5-18.6\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, respectively. The highest AOT40 values were observed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The values of relative yield losses from 2014 to 2017 were in the ranges of 6.4-30.5%, 10.0-35.8%, 14.9-34.1%, and 21.6-38.2%, respectively. The total wheat production losses in NCP for 2014-2017 accounted for 18.5%, 22.7%, 26.2% and 30.8% in the whole production, while the economic losses amounted to 6,292 million USD, 8,524 million USD, 10,068 million USD, and 12,404 million USD, respectively. The important impact of O<sub>3</sub> in this area, which is of global importance, should be considered when assessing wheat yield production. Our results also show an increasing trend in AOT40, relative yield loss, total crop production loss and economic loss in the four consecutive years."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
