Although both skylight phenomena have prompted decades of scientific research, surprisingly few measurements exist of their spectral, colorimetric, and photometric structure. Hyperspectral imaging of several clear twilights supplies these missing radiometric details and reveals some common spectral features of the antisolar sky at twilight: (1)\u00a0color differences between the dark segment and the sunlit sky above the antitwilight arch are small or nil; (2)\u00a0antisolar color and luminance extremes usually occur at different elevation angles; and (3)\u00a0the two twilight phenomena are most vivid for modest aerosol optical depths. A second-order scattering model that includes extinction by aerosols and ozone provides some preliminary radiative transfer explanations of these twilight features' color and brightness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Raymond L", "Initials": "RL", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25967826", "10.1364/AO.54.00B194", "307649"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
