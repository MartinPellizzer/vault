For this purpose, grains with a moisture content of 23.2 % of the \"Tauras\" variety were selected and ventilated daily for 8 hours until grain wetness was reduced to 14.0 %. The effect of ventilation duration and ozone impact was evaluated according to the changes in grain contamination with micromycetes propagules (cfu x g (-1)), and alternation of micromycetes species on the grain surface. At drying grains by active ventilation with an ozone--air mixture, at O (3) concentration of 700 ppb, the drying period was reduced by about 20 %, and mycological contamination depends on initial grain moisture content (w): when w=15.2 %, contamination was reduced by up to 2.2 times, and when w=22.0 %--up to 3 times. At the same time, the composition of micromycetes species on the grain surface changed significantly: in non-ventilated grain there were detected micromycetes of 26 species, and in ventilated grain--of 11 species. Efficient ozone impact was established only when the mound of wet (w>18.0 %) grains was exposed to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lithuanian University of Agriculture, Department of Heat and Biotechnological Engineering, Studentu 15A, LT-53362 Kaunas, Lithuania. algirdas.raila@lzuu.lt"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raila", "ForeName": "Algirdas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lugauskas", "ForeName": "Albinas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steponavicius", "ForeName": "Dainius", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Railiene", "ForeName": "Marija", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steponaviciene", "ForeName": "Ausra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zvicevicius", "ForeName": "Egidijus", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ann Agric Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9500166", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1966"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mycological Typing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17196003", "13287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
