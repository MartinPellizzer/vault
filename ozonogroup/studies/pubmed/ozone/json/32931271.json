Understanding the reactivity of such methoxyphenols at the air-water interface is a matter of major atmospheric interest. Online electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (OESI-MS) is used here to study the oxidation of two methoxyphenols among three phenolic aldehydes, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde, on the surface of water. The OESI-MS results together with cyclic voltammetry measurements at variable pH are integrated into a mechanism describing the heterogeneous oxidative processing of methoxyphenols by gaseous ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and hydroxyl radicals (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>). For a low molar ratio of O<sub>3</sub> \u2264 66 ppbv, the OESI-MS spectra show that the oxidation is dominated by in situ produced HO<sup>\u2022</sup> and results in the production of polyhydroxymethoxyphenols. When the level of O<sub>3</sub> increases (i.e., \u226578 times), the ion count of polyhydroxymethoxyphenols increases, while new ring fragmentation products are generated, including conjugated aldehydes and double bonds as well as additional carboxylic acid groups. The interfacial reactivity of methoxyphenols with O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sup>\u2022</sup> is enhanced as the number of methoxy (-OCH<sub>3</sub>) groups increases (4-hydroxybenzaldehyde < vanillin < syringaldehyde). The experimental observations are summarized in two reaction pathways, leading to the formation of (1) hydroxylated methoxyphenols and (2) multifunctional carboxylic acids from fragmentation of the aromatic ring. The new highly oxygenated products with low volatility are excellent precursors for aqueous SOA formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40506, United States."}], "LastName": "Rana", "ForeName": "Md Sohel", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6730-7766"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40506, United States."}], "LastName": "Guzman", "ForeName": "Marcelo I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32931271", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c05944"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
