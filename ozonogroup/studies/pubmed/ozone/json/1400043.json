Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either 0.98 ppm ozone 8 h/day for 90 days or to filtered air only. En bloc microdissection was used to identify and isolate in longitudinal profile the bronchiole-alveolar duct junction, first pair of alveolar duct generations, and intervening bifurcation ridge. The first alveolar outpocketing along the bronchiolar wall of each isolation was used to identify the center of a series of concentric arcs radiating outward at 100-microns intervals across each ventilatory unit. The intercept lengths of each arc with the tissue of alveolar septal tips (edges) and alveolar walls were measured and expressed as a function of distance into the ventilatory unit. Relative ozone dose across the ventilatory unit was estimated using the geometry of the tracheobronchial tree and the volume and surface area distribution within individual ventilatory units. This mathematical model of ozone dose demonstrated a high degree of correlation to this measured tissue injury response. The findings of this study demonstrate that microdosimetry and microtoxicology can be used to determine dose-response relationships within the ventilatory unit and to assess questions of tissue sensitivity in ozone-induced lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinkerton", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mercer", "ForeName": "R R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crapo", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-04338", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1400043", "10.1152/jappl.1992.73.3.817"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
