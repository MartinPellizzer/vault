The study was designed to compare the effect of L-4F and scramble-4F (SC-4F) in preventing low density lipoprotein (LDL) induced endothelial cell dysfunction. L-4F and SC-4F has the same amino acids but different nucleotide sequence.", "Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were incubated with single L-4F 10 microg/ml or SC-4F 10 microg/ml, or LDL 6.2 mmol/L in the absence or presence of L-4F 10 microg/ml or SC-4F 10 microg/ml for 24 h and assayed for (1) changes of superoxide anion (O2-*) generation in BAEC by superoxide dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable ferricytochrome C reduction, and (2) the production of nitric oxide (NO) in BAEC by ozone chemiluminescence with VCL3.", "(1) L-4F and SC-4F themselves had no affect on BAEC O2-* generation. (2) LDL significantly increased O2-* generation in BAEC and LDL-induced O2-* generation was inhibited by pretreatment of LDL with L-4F. However, pretreatment of LDL with SC-4F had no effect on inhibition of LDL-induced O2-* generation. (3) LDL significantly inhibited NO generation in BAEC and pretreatment of LDL with L-4F could inhibit LDL-induced decrease of NO generation, but pretreatment of LDL with SC-4F still inhibited NO generation in BAEC.", "L-4F can prevent LDL induced endothelial cell dysfunction by maintaining the balance of NO and O2-*, but SC-4F doesn't. It suggests that the specific structure of L-4F may play a crucial role in preventing atherosclerosis and it may provide a new clue for searching a novel approach on prevention and therapeutics of atherosclerosis in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou 510120, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Zhi-jun", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Jing-song", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Cheng-jian", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pritchard", "ForeName": "Kirkwood A", "Initials": "KA", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 HL 61417", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL71214", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7910682", "ISSNLinking": "0253-3758"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "L-4F peptide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi. 2006 Feb;34(2):163", "Note": "Kirkwood A [corrected to Pritchard, Kirkwood A Jr];Pritchard Jr [corrected to Pritchard, Kirkwood A Jr]"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15932696"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
