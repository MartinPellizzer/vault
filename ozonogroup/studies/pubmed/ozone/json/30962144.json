Not much is known regarding the influence of non-smoking-related risk factors on COPD in Taiwan. We examined the relationship between exposure to particulate matter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and COPD among nonsmokers in Taiwan.", "This population-based study involved 3941 nonsmoking Taiwanese adults who were recruited in the Taiwan Biobank project between 2008 and 2015. Air pollution data between 2006 and 2011 were obtained from the air quality monitoring database (AQMD). COPD was the outcome of interest and was identified using the National health insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression models.", "Compared with the lowest quartile (PM<sub>2.5</sub>\u202f=\u202f29.38), exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the highest quartile (>38.98\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) was significantly associated with COPD (OR, 1.29; CI 1.01-1.65) after multivariate adjustments. However, exposures to concentrations of 32.07-38.98\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (OR, 1.12 CI 0.88-1.44) and 29.38-32.07\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (OR, 1.09 CI 0.84-1.41) showed positive but non-significant associations. However, the test for trend was significant (Ptrend\u202f=\u202f0.043). The ORs for exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and NOx (nitrogen monoxide (NO were not significant.", "Based on our data, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> at concentrations greater than 38.98\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increased susceptibility to COPD among Taiwanese nonsmokers.
