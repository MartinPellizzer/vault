Herein, we first established a systematic methodology to identify the ligands of Ni(II)-complexes in an electroless nickel (EN) plating effluent. The presence of N-containing groups in the ligands of most Ni(II)-complexes was verified by time-aligned ICP-MS and ESI-HRMS, implying the suitability of autocatalytic ozonation for efficient decomplexation. Thereby, a combined process was proposed on the basis of ozonation to achieve over 83% decomplexation of Ni(II) (initially at 0.36\u202fmg/L), followed by selective Ni(II) sequestration for resource recovery. Combinational LC-MS systems revealed the ozonation-induced fragmentation or elimination of most Ni(II)-complexes as well as the structural change of the residual complexed molecules. The released free Ni(II) was further sequestrated by a nanocomposite of hydrated Zr(IV) oxide confined in a polymeric cation exchanger (nHZO@PCE). The fixed-bed working capacity of nHZO@PCE (\u223c550 BV) for the ozonated EN plating effluent was over 18 times that of the cation exchanger host (\u223c30 BV) at the breakthrough point of 0.10\u202fmg Ni/L. More attractively, five adsorption-regeneration cycles demonstrated the great potential of the hybrid adsorbent for sustainable utilization. This study is believed to shed new light on how to design rational processes for advanced treatment of real wastewater based on molecular identification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
