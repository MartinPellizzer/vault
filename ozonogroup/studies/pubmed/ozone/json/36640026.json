In this study, influential parameters affecting the removal rate of polyethylene microplastics (PEMPs) were optimized through response surface methodology (RSM). In Box Behnken Design (BBD), independent parameters were pH, PEMP size, coagulant dosage and polyacrylamide dosage. Two experimental sets were conducted, one with ferric chloride and the second with poly aluminum chloride as two commonly applied coagulants in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Comparing the results of optimized parameters, PAC was a better coagulant with the predicted removal rate of 58.19%, while the removal rate with ferric chloride as a coagulant was predicted to be 56.37%. Moreover, some experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of ozone gas and sodium hypochlorite as disinfectants on removal rate. The highest removal rate was observed when 2 ppm of O<sub>3</sub> was added to the solution coagulated with optimal dosage of PAC, reaching the removal rate of 76.8%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Islamic Azad University, West Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran E-mail: r.mafigholami@wtiau.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Tabatabaei", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Islamic Azad University, West Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran E-mail: r.mafigholami@wtiau.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Mafigholami", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghimi", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Islamic Azad University, West Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran E-mail: r.mafigholami@wtiau.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Khoramipoor", "ForeName": "Sanaz", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "U38V3ZVV3V", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microplastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microplastics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36640026", "10.2166/wst.2022.393"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
