Common examples are the top and bottom sides of the butterfly wing or lotus leaf, onion shells, and the inside versus outside of the stem of a flower. Inspired by nature, we create dual (top and bottom) channel patterned polymer films. To this end, we first develop a novel fabrication method to create ceramic line channel relief structures by converting the oligomeric residue of stamped poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) nanopatterns on silicon substrates to glass (SiOx, silica) by ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) exposure. These silica patterned substrates are flow coated with polystyrene (PS) films and confined within an identically patterned top confining soft PDMS elastomer film. Annealing of the sandwich structures drives the PS to rapidly mold fill the top PDMS pattern in conjunction with a dewetting tendency of the PS on the silica pattern. Varying the film thickness h, from less than to greater than the pattern height, and varying the relative angle between the top-down and bottom-up patterned confinement surfaces create interesting uniform and nonuniform digitized defects in PS channel patterns, as also a defect-free channel regime. Our dual patterned polymer channels provide a novel fabrication route to topographically imprinted Moir\u00e9 patterns (whose applications range from security encrypting holograms to sensitive strain gauges), and their basic laser light diffractions properties are illustrated and compared to graphical simulations and 2D-FFT of real-space AFM channel patterns. While traditional \"geometrical\" and \"fringe\" Moir\u00e9 patterns function by superposition of two misaligned optical patterned transmittance gratings, our topographic pattern gratings are quite distinct and may allow for more unique holographic optical characteristics with further development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Polymer Engineering, University of Akron , Akron, Ohio 44325, United States."}], "LastName": "Grolman", "ForeName": "Danielle", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Polymer Engineering, University of Akron , Akron, Ohio 44325, United States."}], "LastName": "Bandyopadhyay", "ForeName": "Diya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Saud University , PO Box 2455, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Enizi", "ForeName": "Abdullah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Technology Program, College of Arts and Sciences, Qatar University , PO Box 2713, Doha, Qatar."}], "LastName": "Elzatahry", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1302-9374"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Polymer Engineering, University of Akron , Akron, Ohio 44325, United States."}], "LastName": "Karim", "ForeName": "Alamgir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28562002", "10.1021/acsami.7b00779"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
