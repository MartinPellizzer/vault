The results showed that these 'emerging contaminants' were completely degraded, when the removal rate of organic matter reached 30.6% and 49.1% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. Likewise, the aromaticity removal rates were 63.4% and 77.9% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. The experimental design showed that pH was the variable which had the greatest effect on the Fe2+/ozonation. The kinetic constants of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol degradation by direct ozonation complied with pseudo-first-order conditions, while Fe2+/ozonation was suited to a biphasic degradation model. The k obs tended to rise when the pH increases; propranolol showed high k obs, which can be attributed to the naphthalene group (an electron-rich moiety). The identification of degradation products was carried out in aqueous solution using HPLC-MS2, followed by a suggestion of degradation pathways by means of ozonation. The degradation products proved to be dependent on the initial pH, and followed pathways that are based on direct ozonolysis and free radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wilde", "ForeName": "Marcelo L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Montip\u00f3", "ForeName": "Sheila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Ayrton F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24436986", "10.1016/j.watres.2013.09.039"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
