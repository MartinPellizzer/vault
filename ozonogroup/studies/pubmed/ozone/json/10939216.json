State-of-the-art sampling methodologies were used to obtain continuous PM2.5 concentration and size distribution particulate data for both indoor and outdoor air. Study homes, five of which were sampled during two seasons, were monitored over week-long periods. Among other data collected during the extensive monitoring efforts were 24-hr elemental/organic carbon (EC/OC) particulate data as well as semi-continuous air exchange rates and time-activity information. This rich data set shows that indoor particle events tend to be brief, intermittent, and highly variable, thus requiring the use of continuous instrumentation for their characterization. In addition to dramatically increasing indoor PM2.5 concentrations, these data demonstrate that indoor particle events can significantly alter the size distribution and composition of indoor particles. Source event data demonstrate that the impacts of indoor activities are especially pronounced in the ultrafine (da < or = 0.1 micron) and coarse (2.5 < or = da < or = 10 microns) modes. Among the sources of ultrafine particles characterized in this study are indoor ozone/terpene reactions. Furthermore, EC/OC data suggest that organic carbon is a major constituent of particles emitted during indoor source events. Whether exposures to indoor-generated particles, particularly from large short-term peak events, may be associated with adverse health effects will become clearer when biological mechanisms are better known."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. clong@hsph.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koutrakis", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Housing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10939216", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464154"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
