The data were fit to the original model and to a version of the model that contains a threshold below which no response occurs using a statistical program for fitting nonlinear mixed models.", "Mean predicted FEV\u2081 responses and the predicted proportions of individuals experiencing FEV\u2081 responses greater than 10, 15, and 20% were found to be in agreement with observed responses across a wide range of exposure conditions for both models. The threshold model, however, provided a better fit to the data than the original, particularly at the lowest levels of exposure.", "The models identified in this manuscript predict population FEV\u2081 response characteristics for 18-35-year-old individuals exposed to ozone over a wide range of conditions and represent a substantial improvement over earlier E-R models. Because of its better fit to the data, particularly at low levels of exposure, the threshold model is likely to provide more accurate estimates of risk in future risk assessments of ozone-induced FEV\u2081 effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "William F McDonnell Consulting, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.
