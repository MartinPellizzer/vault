It includes emission estimation and photochemical box modeling in support of investigating the underlying nature of O3 formation over the city and the roles of precursors emitted from sources. The year 2006 was considered and two single-day episodes (January 29 and February 14) were chosen for simulations. It was found that, in the city, the industrial sector is the largest emissions contributor for every O3 precursor (i.e., NO(x), non-methane volatile organic compounds or NMVOC, and CO), followed by on-road mobile group. Fugitive NMVOC is relatively large, emitted mainly from oil refineries and tank farms. Simulated results acceptably agree with observations for daily maximum O3 level in both episodes and evidently indicate the VOC-sensitive regime for O3 formation. This regime is also substantiated by morning NMVOC/NO(x) ratios observed in the city. The corresponding O3 isopleth diagrams suggest NMVOC control alone to lower elevated O3. In seeking a potential O3 control strategy for the city, a combination of brute-force sensitivity tests, an experimental design, statistical modeling, and cost optimization was employed. A number of emission subgroups were found to significantly contribute to O3 formation, based on the February 14 episode, for example, oil refinery (fugitive), tank farm (fugitive), passenger car (gasoline), and motorcycle (gasoline). But the cost-effective strategy suggests control only on the first two subgroups to meet the standard. The cost of implementing the strategy was estimated and found to be small (only 0.2%) compared to the gross provincial product generated by the entire province where the city is located within. These findings could be useful as a needed guideline to support O3 management for the city.", "Elevated O3 in the urban and industrial city of Chon Buri needs better understanding of the problem and technical guidelines for its management. With a city-specific emission inventory and air quality modeling, O3 formation was found to be VOC sensitive, and a cost-effective control strategy developed highlights fugitive emissions from the industrial sector to be controlled."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Graduate School of Energy and Environment, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, 126 Prachauthit Rd., Bangmod, Tungkru, Bangkok 10140, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Prabamroong", "ForeName": "Thayukorn", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Manomaiphiboon", "ForeName": "Kasemsan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Limpaseni", "ForeName": "Wongpun", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sukhapan", "ForeName": "Jariya", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bonnet", "ForeName": "Sebastien", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cost-Benefit Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23362760", "10.1080/10962247.2012.716385"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
