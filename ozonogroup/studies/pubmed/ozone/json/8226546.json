Acetylcholine-induced airway responses were measured before and after inhalation of O3 (3 ppm, 30 min) or dry air. In vitro experiments were performed with intact ring segments of third- to fifth-order bronchi. Bronchial responses to carbachol (CCh) were evaluated in Krebs solution (2.5 mM Ca2+) and in Ca(2+)-free [0.1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)] Krebs solution with or without indomethacin (IDM, 10(-5) M) and were expressed as percentage of the maximal KCl response (60 mM). Inhalation of O3, but not dry air, caused airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine in vivo. Responses to 50% effective concentrations of CCh were similar in bronchial preparations from O3 and control animals (with or without IDM) in normal Krebs solution. In Ca(2+)-free solution, CCh induced a sustained (20-min) bronchial contraction. These contractions relaxed immediately when nifedipine or a high EGTA concentration was added to the organ bath. The sustained contraction was abolished when the tissues had been incubated with cyclopiazonic acid (10(-5) M), a novel inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump. After O3 exposure, responses of the bronchial smooth muscle (in Ca(2+)-free medium without IDM) were increased (P < 0.05) compared with controls during the first and second CCh stimulations. This O3-induced increase in response to CCh in Ca(2+)-free solution was abolished when the tissues were incubated with IDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monta\u00f1o", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Byrne", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daniel", "ForeName": "E E", "Initials": "EE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8Y164V895Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbachol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X9TLY4580Z", "NameOfSubstance": "cyclopiazonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstriction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbachol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Space"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8226546", "10.1152/jappl.1993.75.3.1315"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
