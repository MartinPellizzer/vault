To prevent aerosol infections, ozone and chlorine dioxide gases are practical methods in room air. However, ozone requires relatively high concentrations for this purpose, which might be toxic to humans present in the room. On the other hand, the low concentration of chlorine dioxide gas and aqueous solution are sufficiently effective against aerosol infection for the causative microorganism, and it is expected that when it is used in combination with a high-efficiency particulate air filter, it will be highly safe with high prevention effect and cost effectiveness."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Juntendo Medical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Obinata", "ForeName": "Kaoru", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Juntendo Iji Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "9918713988906676", "ISSNLinking": "2187-9737"}, "CoiStatement": "The author declares that there are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Tsang HF, Chan LWC, Cho WCS, et al. : An update on COVID-19 pandemic: the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment strategies.
