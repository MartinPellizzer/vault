Irradiation of freshly deposited matrices with near-infrared light (\u03bb = 880 nm) from an LED resulted in new peaks in their infrared spectra that were assigned to three new ruthenocene oxide structures (<b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>) calculated by the density functional theory. It is proposed that the near-infrared light caused photodissociation of some ozone molecules and subsequent reactions of the atomic oxygen produced with adjacent ruthenocene molecules in the matrix. Structures <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> contain a Ru=O oxo group resulting from the attack of atomic oxygen on the ruthenium atom, and structure <b>6</b> contains a C=O aldehyde group resulting from the attack of atomic oxygen on a ring carbon atom. Subsequent irradiation of the matrix with red light (\u03bb = 625 nm) from an LED resulted in a fourth new structure (<b>7</b>), and it also initiated a reversible photochemical conversion <b>4</b> \u21c4 <b>5</b> + O<sub>2</sub>, with the forward direction promoted by red light (\u03bb = 625 nm) and the reverse direction promoted by near-infrared light (\u03bb = 880 nm). Structure <b>7</b>, which contains ruthenium-coordinated cyclopentadienyl, cyclopentadienone, and hydride ion, is the most stable of the four new structures as shown by the calculated energies relative to ruthenocene plus O(<sup>3</sup>P). Structure <b>7</b> is proposed as an intermediate in the chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition of the Ru/RuO<sub>2</sub> film forming reactions on substrates at elevated temperatures reported in the literature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio 45221 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kugel", "ForeName": "Roger W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio 45221 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3355-1960"], "LastName": "Ault", "ForeName": "Bruce S", "Initials": "BS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31150227", "10.1021/acs.jpca.9b02374"]}}]}
