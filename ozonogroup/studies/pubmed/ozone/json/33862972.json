Ambient levels were relatively low and accumulated to an AOT40 (accumulated exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb) of 4055 ppb h (for the period 23 Apr-30 Sept). The NF + chambers received an AOT40 of 8880 ppb h. Throughout the growing season we measured growth and photosynthetic properties. The treatments did not cause strong effects: measurements of gas exchange (light-saturated assimilation rate, CO<sub>2</sub> and light-response curves) and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slight and mostly non-significant reductions of several parameters. No significant differences were found for growth, though in the NF + treatment (AOT40 8880 ppb h) the relative growth rate for diameter increment was at times reduced by 12% compared with the control treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 University of Antwerp (UIA), Department of Biology, Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bortier", "ForeName": "Katrien", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 University of Antwerp (UIA), Department of Biology, Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ceulemans", "ForeName": "Reinhart", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 University of Antwerp (UIA), Department of Biology, Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DE Temmerman", "ForeName": "Ludwig", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33862972", "10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00633.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
