Water and larvae samples were collected from three different aquaculture systems; stagnant, flow-through and a flow- through system with seawater treated with ozone. Samples were also collected from different algal cultures, inlet tanks and water pipes leading to the different aquaculture systems. Clear differences were seen between the bacterial community associated with the larvae and in the water from the different aquaculture systems. However, there were high similarities in the community composition between different water samples and between larvae samples collected at different time periods, indicating a high stability in the bacterial communities. Fifty three percent of the sequences from these samples were similar to 16S rRNA gene sequences of members of the gamma-subclass of the Proteobacteria. The different algal cultures had different bacterial communities, however 73 percent of the sequences were similar to 16S rRNA gene sequences of members of the alpha-subclass of the Proteobacteria. Differences in the DGGE profiles were also seen between the samples taken from the inlet tanks and water pipes, indicating a change in the bacterial community composition as the water passed through the pipes. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating bacterial communities associated with Great Scallop larvae in different aquaculture systems including noncultured components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway. ruth.sandaa@im.uib.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandaa", "ForeName": "Ruth-Anne", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magnesen", "ForeName": "Thorolf", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torkildsen", "ForeName": "Lise", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergh", "ForeName": "Oivind", "Initials": "O"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AY117756", "AY117757", "AY117758", "AY117759", "AY117760", "AY117761", "AY117762", "AY117763", "AY117764", "AY117765", "AY117766", "AY117767", "AY117768", "AY117769", "AY117770"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Syst Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8306133", "ISSNLinking": "0723-2020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alphaproteobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aquaculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Typing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Gammaproteobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mollusca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Denaturation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribotyping"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12866858", "10.1078/072320203322346164", "S0723-2020(04)70192-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
