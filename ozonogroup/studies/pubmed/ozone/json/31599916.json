According to thermodynamic research, the process of H-abstraction on the -CH- group adjacent to the hydroxyl group is the most dominant pathway with the lowest activation energy. The analysis of Mulliken charge charts and molecular electrostatic potential maps illustrate that C-H bonds are the active sites of the reaction, and the calculated C-H bond dissociation energy of the CH3CH2C(O)CH(OH)CH2CH3 molecule further confirms that \u03b1-CH is the most easily activated. Individual rate constants for five H-abstraction pathways are calculated by canonical variational theory coupled with small curvature tunneling method over the temperature range of 260-330 K, and the branching ratios are also evaluated. A total rate constant of 1.18 \u00d7 10-15 cm3 per molecule per s is obtained at 298 K, which is in good agreement with the reported experimental value. A negative temperature dependence is observed in the titular reaction. The subsequent degradation processes of the advantageous product alkyl radical (CH3CH2C\u02d9(OH)COCH2CH3) are carried out in a NO-rich environment, and propionic acid, NO2 and ozone are obtained as the major final products. The nighttime atmospheric lifetime of 4-hydroxy-3-hexanone is estimated to be around 19 days, indicating that it has impact at night. The titular reaction rate constants are fitted to a three-parameter Arrhenius formula."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Material Chemistry, National & Local United Engineering Lab for Power Battery, Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130024, People's Republic of China. panxm460@nenu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Fengyang", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": ""}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Xiumei", "Initials": "X", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propionates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "propioin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JHU490RVYR", "NameOfSubstance": "propionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hexanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Propionates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31599916", "10.1039/c9em00358d"]}}]}
