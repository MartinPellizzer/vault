Common log reduction requirements have been modeled after California Department of Drinking Water's 12-10-10 log reduction value (LRV) for enteric virus, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia, respectively. The objective of this research was to investigate appropriate LRVs of pathogens that can be achieved in ozone-BAC-based treatment systems and to assess the applicability of employing drinking water pathogen guidelines for potable reuse applications. A pilot scale ozone-BAC-based treatment train was operated at two water reclamation facilities in Reno, Nevada, USA. Virus, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and bacterial indicators were monitored across individual and combined treatment processes. Pathogen barriers investigated include conventional filtration, ozonation, and ultraviolet disinfection. Based on sampling and treatment validation strategies, the three pathogen barriers can provide minimum LRVs of 13-9-9.5 for virus, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. Secondary biological treatment can provide additional pathogen LRVs with site-specific sampling. The present study addresses regulatory uncertainties associated with ozone-BAC pathogen reduction. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Ozone-biological activated carbon-based advanced treatment can meet pathogen LRV requirements with a minimum of three pathogen barriers. Successfully applied drinking water pathogen reduction guidelines for potable reuse applications verified by operational criteria. Low presence of pathogens requires surrogates and indicator analyses and variety of monitoring techniques to verify pathogen log reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Water Environment Federation."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8625-7207"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Truckee Meadows Water Authority, Reno, Nevada, USA."}], "LastName": "Teel", "ForeName": "Lydia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3207-2431"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA."}], "LastName": "Pagilla", "ForeName": "Krishna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AECOM, Sacramento, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Sundaram", "ForeName": "Vijay", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3880-4579"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8475-6638"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA."}], "LastName": "Guarin", "ForeName": "Tatiana", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental, Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA."}], "LastName": "Haak", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Giardia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Amoueyan, E., Ahmad, S., Eisenberg, J.
