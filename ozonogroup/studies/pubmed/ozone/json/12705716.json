The purpose of this study was to investigate ventilatory parameters in relation to the antioxidant status measured as total antioxidant status (TAS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CT). The study group consisted of 94 welders, aged 41.2 +/- 10.0 years, employed in the Steel Mill in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, and exposed to nitric oxides and ozone in concentrations exceeding the threshold limit values. The control group consisted of 115 unexposed healthy workers aged 40.8 +/- 10.2 years. All the subjects under study were smokers. Determination of ventilatory efficiency was based on a \"flow-volume\" curve and spirometry. TAS was measured using reagents from the Randox Laboratories Ltd, SOD according to Fridovich and CT with Aebi's method. It was found that in the group of welders, the concentrations of TAS, CT and SOD were lower compared to controls (TAS-1.15/1.33 mmol/ml; CT-18.1/28.4 m/gHb, SOD-767.6/855.6 U/gHb). The incidence of extreme obstructive pulmonary disease and small airway disease in the welder group was more frequent than in controls. Changes in the concentration (or activity) of antioxidant parameters cannot be used as early markers of ventilatory dysfunction, although the values in the lowest class of TAS, SOD and CT showed a significantly larger number of welders than controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radioligand Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stepnewski", "ForeName": "Marek", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kolarzyk", "ForeName": "Emilia", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietrzycka", "ForeName": "Agata", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitlinski", "ForeName": "Mariusz", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Helbin", "ForeName": "Jadwiga", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brzyszczan", "ForeName": "Klaudyna", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Occup Med Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9437093", "ISSNLinking": "1232-1087"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Control Groups"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Threshold Limit Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workforce"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12705716"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
