This study aimed to investigate changes in serum metabolites associated with immediate, short- and medium-term exposures to ambient air pollution.", "We used data from the German population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 survey (1999-2001) and two follow-up examinations (F4: 2006-08 and FF4: 2013-14). Mass-spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics was used to quantify metabolites among serum samples. Only participants with repeated metabolites measurements were included in this analysis. We collected daily averages of fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), coarse particles (PM<sub>coarse</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at urban background monitors located in Augsburg, Germany. Covariate-adjusted generalized additive mixed-effects models were used to examine the associations between immediate (2-day average of same day and previous day as individual's blood withdrawal), short- (2-week moving average), and medium-term exposures (8-week moving average) to air pollution and metabolites. We further performed pathway analysis for the metabolites significantly associated with air pollutants in each exposure window.", "Of 9,620 observations from 4,261 study participants, we included 5,772 (60.0%) observations from 2,583 (60.6%) participants in this analysis. Out of 108 metabolites that passed quality control, multiple significant associations between metabolites and air pollutants with several exposure windows were identified at a Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold (p\u00a0<\u00a03.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup>). We found the highest number of associations for NO<sub>2</sub>, particularly at the medium-term exposure windows. Among the identified metabolic pathways based on the metabolites significantly associated with air pollutants, the glycerophospholipid metabolism was the most robust pathway in different air pollutants exposures.", "Our study suggested that short- and medium-term exposure to air pollution might induce alterations of serum metabolites, particularly in metabolites involved in metabolic pathways related to inflammatory response and oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
