The authors studied Indian patients with RHD and preoperative PAH, who undergo cardiac surgery with a hypothesis that they have poor short and long-term outcomes.", "This was a retrospective observational study of 407 patients. The patients were divided in three groups based on PAH estimated on echocardiograph as; no or mild PAH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) <30 mm of Hg); moderate PAH (PASP 31-55 mm of Hg) and severe PAH (PASP >55 mm of Hg). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and major morbidities; while secondary endpoint was long-term survival.", "In-hospital mortality was 24 (5.9%); and was not different in patients with severe, (9.1%), moderate (4.5%) or mild PAH (2.8%) (<i>P</i> = 0.09). Patients with severe PAH had higher incidence of prolonged ventilation (<i>P</i> = 0.007). Factors independently associated with mortality were; >2-packed cell transfusion, prolonged ventilation and acute kidney injury but not moderate and severe PAH. Patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and severe PAH had significantly higher mortality as compared to no or mild PAH (<i>P</i> = 0.03) on long-term follow-up [81.37% (mean duration 19.40 \u00b1 14.10 months)], mortality was 8% and not statistically different (<i>P</i> = 0.25) across PAH categories.", "Moderate and severe PAH does not affect short and long term outcomes of patients undergoing valve surgery for RHD.
