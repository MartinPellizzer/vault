While ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure also raises the probability of depressive behavior during the preceding DIDP-induced process. In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to DIDP and O<sub>3</sub> on the development of depressive-like behavior in offspring mice. The study found that prenatal exposure to both DIDP and O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased depressive-like behavior in the offspring mice compared to either DIDP or O<sub>3</sub> alone. Prenatal exposure to DIDP and O<sub>3</sub> obviously increased the levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, and decreased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the brain tissues of offspring mice. Transcriptome analysis further revealed significant alterations in genes related to oxidative stress and TWIST1 (a helix-loop-helix transcription factor) in response to the combined exposure to DIDP and O<sub>3</sub>. HPA axis activation, dysregulation of neurodevelopmental factors, oxidative stress and TWIST1 involvement, collectively contributed to the development of depression-like behaviors in offspring mice following prenatal exposure to DIDP and O<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, the study also verified the potential role of oxidative stress using vitamin E as an antioxidant. The findings provide valuable evidence for the relationship between co-exposure to DIDP and O<sub>3</sub> and depression, highlighting the importance of considering the combined effects of multiple environmental pollutants in assessing their impact on mental health outcomes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
