A comparison among ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), ultrasonic (US), ozone/ultrasonic (O<sub>3</sub>/US) for degradation of reactive red X-3B has been performed. Results show that O<sub>3</sub>/US system was the most effective and the optimally synergetic factor reaches to 1.42 in O<sub>3</sub>/US system. The cavitation of ultrasound plays an important role during the degradation process. It is found that 99.2% of dye is degraded within 6min of reaction at the initial concentration of 100mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, pH of 6.52, ozone flux of 40L\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup> and ultrasonic intensity of 200W\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. Ozonation reactions in conjunction with sonolysis indicate that the decomposition followed pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics but the degradation efficiencies are affected by operating conditions, particularly initial pH and ultrasonic intensity. A kinetic model is established based on the reaction corresponding to operational parameters. In addition, the main reaction intermediates, such as p-benzoquinone, catechol, hydroquinone, phthalic anhydride and phthalic acid, are separated and identified using GC/MS and a possible degradation pathway is proposed during the O<sub>3</sub>/US process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
