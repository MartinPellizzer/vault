Fifty extracted caries-free permanent incisors were used in this study. Thirty-eight percent hydrogen peroxidegel was applied to sound, flattened labial enamel surfaces and activated by different sources. Enamel surfaces that had received no treatment were used as control samples. Bonding agent was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions and the adhesion test was performed according to ISO/TS 11405. Statistical analysis showed significant influence of the different activation technique of hydrogen peroxide on shear bond strength to enamel (ANOVA, LSD, P < 0.05). The data in this vitro explorative study suggest the activation of hydrogen peroxide by different sources may further affect the shear bond strength of subsequent composite resin restoration to enamel. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, further studies examining the structural changes of activated hydrogen peroxide-treated enamel are needed. Due to the different activation methods; duration of light irradiation effects, longer time periods may be needed before application of adhesive restorations to enamel, compared with non-activated bleaching."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Operative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Near East University, Mersin, Turkey. cdenizcank@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Can-Karabulut", "ForeName": "Deniz C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karabulut", "ForeName": "Baris", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Esthet Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101285292", "ISSNLinking": "1862-0612"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Clearfil SE Bond"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resin Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "clearfil majesty"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adhesiveness"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Stress Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Semiconductor"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phototherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resin Cements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shear Strength"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Mechanical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21069109", "852052"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
