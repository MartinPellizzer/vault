Evidence exists from a limited set of past observations that isoprene emission rate (I<sub>s</sub> ) decreases as a function of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and that increased temperature suppresses the CO<sub>2</sub> effect. We studied interactions between intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (C<sub>i</sub> ) and temperature as they affect I<sub>s</sub> in field-grown hybrid poplar trees in one of the warmest climates on earth - the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States. We observed an unexpected midsummer downregulation of I<sub>s</sub> despite the persistence of relatively high temperatures. High temperature suppression of the I<sub>s</sub> :C<sub>i</sub> relation occurred at all times during the growing season, but sensitivity of I<sub>s</sub> to increased C<sub>i</sub> was greatest during the midsummer period when I<sub>s</sub> was lowest. We interpret the seasonal downregulation of I<sub>s</sub> and increased sensitivity of I<sub>s</sub> to C<sub>i</sub> as being caused by weather changes associated with the onset of a regional monsoon system. Our observations on the temperature suppression of the I<sub>s</sub> :C<sub>i</sub> relation are best explained by the existence of a small pool of chloroplastic inorganic phosphate, balanced by several large, connected metabolic fluxes, which together, determine the C<sub>i</sub> and temperature dependencies of phosphoenolpyruvate import into the chloroplast."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA. russmonson@email.arizona.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Tree Ring Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA. russmonson@email.arizona.edu."}], "LastName": "Monson", "ForeName": "Russell K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Hiram College, Hiram, Ohio, 44234, USA."}], "LastName": "Neice", "ForeName": "Amberly A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA."}], "LastName": "Trahan", "ForeName": "Nicole A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA."}], "LastName": "Shiach", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biospheric Sciences Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, 20771, USA."}], "LastName": "McCorkel", "ForeName": "Joel T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA."}], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "David J P", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0A62964IBU", "NameOfSubstance": "isoprene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heat-Shock Response"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27352095", "10.1111/pce.12787"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
