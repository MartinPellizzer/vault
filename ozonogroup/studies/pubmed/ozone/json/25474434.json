High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is the most widely used inflammatory marker in clinical medicine and is correlated with mortality in PD patients. Air pollution is associated with systemic inflammation. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the role of air pollutants and other clinical variables on hs-CRP values in PD patients.We recruited a total of 175 patients who had been undergoing continuous ambulatory PD or automated PD for at least 4 months and regularly followed up. Air pollution levels were recorded by a network of 27 monitoring stations near or in the patients' living areas throughout Taiwan. The 12-month average concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 and <2.5\u200a\u03bcm (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) were included.In stepwise linear regression, after adjustment for related factors, white blood cell count (\u03b2: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.71, 2.11]) and CO level (\u03b2: 0.17, 95% CI [2.5, 21.32]) were positively associated with hs-CRP and serum albumin levels (\u03b2: -0.25, 95% CI [-13.69, -3.96]) and normalized protein nitrogen appearance (\u03b2: -0.18, 95% CI [-17.7, -2.51]) was negatively associated with hs-CRP. However, serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate levels were not significantly associated with hs-CRP (P > 0.05).In PD patients, the environmental CO level was positively correlated with hs-CRP level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the Department of Nephrology and Division of Clinical Toxicology (W-HH, T-HY); Department of Internal Medicine (M-JC, Y-JS), Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou; and Chang Gung University College of Medicine (W-HH, T-HY), Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wen-Hung", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yen", "ForeName": "Tzung-Hai", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Ming-Jen", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yi-Jiun", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Medicine (Baltimore)", "NlmUniqueID": "2985248R", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7974"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Reactive Protein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Failure, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneal Dialysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Wang AY.
