The concentration levels of VOCs from solvent-based coating (63.90-149.67 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) are much higher than that from water-based, electrophoretic, and powder coating (2.99-21.93 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). With respect to the VOC composition, aromatics are the main VOC group of solvent-based coating emission, ranging from 52.32%-71.55%. Typical species include toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and ethyl acetate. The VOCs emitted from water-based coating are mainly oxygenated VOCs, such as ethyl acetate (48.59%) and tetrahydrofuran (8.43%), while the percentage of aromatics (11.32%) is lower than that of solvent-based coating. Isopropanol is the most abundant species of electrophoretic coating emissions, accounting for up to 81.19% of the VOCs. The major VOC compounds of powder coating processes are acetone (30.25%), propane (15.48%), ethylene (12.15%), ethane (9.35%), and <i>n</i>-butane (5.16%). The calculation of the ozone formation potential (OFP) shows that the solvent-based coating has the highest OFP (3.89 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>), followed by powder coating (2.53 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>), while water-based and electrophoretic coating have lower OFPs (1.31 and 0.85 g\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). The most important contributor to OFP of solvent-based coating are aromatics, especially C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> aromatics. The major contributors of water-based coating are ethyl acetate, <i>m/p</i>-xylenes, and toluene, with contributions of 23.24%, 21.76%, and 17.07%, respectively. The key reactive components of powder coating are ethylene, propene, and 1-butene; the sum of alkenes accounts for 71.11% of the OFP. With respect to the contribution of VOCs emitted from electrophoretic coating to the OFP, the percentage of isopropanol (65.08%) is significantly larger than that of other species (<6%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technological Center of Nanhai District in Foshan City, Foshan 528200, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technological Center of Nanhai District in Foshan City, Foshan 528200, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Wei-Jian", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technological Center of Nanhai District in Foshan City, Foshan 528200, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bi-Xia", "Initials": "BX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Technological Center of Nanhai District in Foshan City, Foshan 528200, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changsha Center for Mineral Resources Exploration, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Chengyuan Testing Co., Ltd., Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yue-Gang", "Initials": "YG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-Peng", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628376", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201803224"]}}]}
