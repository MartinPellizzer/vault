In this study, as an initial effort to understand the therapeutic mechanisms of O3-AHT, we aim to examine the effect of O3-AHT on serum inflammatory cytokine levels in gouty patients.", "Three groups of patients and healthy subjects were recruited, including the gouty (n=10), hyperuricemia (n=10), and healthy control (n=11) groups. Cytometric bead array was applied to examine 12 cytokines before (T0), during (T1), and after (T2) therapies.", "Three cytokines, IL-8, IL-12, and MCP-1, were detectable in all participants. Before O3-AHT, the average serum levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 were higher in the gout group than in the hyperuricemia and healthy control groups, confirming the inflammation status in gouty patients. After the 5th course of O3-AHT (T1), IL-8 level was significantly increased compared to that at T0. IL-12 level was also raised at T1, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. After completing the therapy, both IL-8 and IL-12 levels decreased to levels lower than those at T0. MCP-1 level remained essentially unchanged during and after treatment.", "Our results indicate that O3-AHT induces a significant change in serum cytokine levels, suggesting that modulating the inflammatory process is one of the therapeutic mechanisms underlying O3-AHT. In addition, the sensitive response of serum IL-8 and IL-12 levels to O3-AHT suggests that these cytokines may be developed as biomarkers to evaluate the therapeutic effect of O3-AHT in gouty patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Dongfang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain, Beijing Electric Power Hospital."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lian-Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ruo-Lan", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Liqin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "An-Shi", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "New Zealand", "MedlineTA": "Open Access Rheumatol", "NlmUniqueID": "101688698", "ISSNLinking": "1179-156X"}, "CoiStatement": "Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Busso N, So A.
