The removals were evaluated as single components and in binary systems at different oxidant dosages. Chlorination showed insignificant removal for both pharmaceuticals, while ozonation and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> achieved significant removals for both ibuprofen and gemfibrozil. The highest removal efficiency of ibuprofen achieved with ozonation and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in TSE was 80% at 1.5\u202fmg/L ozone dosage (0.27\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC) within 5\u202fmin contact time and was not increased at extended times as the ozone residual approached zero in 5\u202fmin. For gemfibrozil, complete removals were achieved at ozone dosages of 1 and 1.5\u202fmg/L by both ozonation and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within 30\u202fs. The rate constants obtained from the second order kinetics study were almost similar for the binary and single component tests, however, the degradation of ibuprofen was around four times faster by O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with a rate constant of 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>\u202fs<sup>-1</sup> in comparison to ozone alone. The results in the single component and binary systems were almost similar for gemfibrozil, but noticeably lower removals of ibuprofen were obtained in the binary system showing the higher selectivity and oxidation demand of gemfibrozil. Although O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has a higher operation cost, but its capability for faster degradation makes it preferable over ozonation only, as more water can be treated on a daily basis or a smaller treatment plant can be used with lower capital cost, which practically becomes more cost efficient."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
