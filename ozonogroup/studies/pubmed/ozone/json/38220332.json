This work aimed at using greener processes combining mild alkali (A), ozone (O) and enzymatic (engineered xylanase) (E) treatments to extract cellulose and other value-added compounds from rice straw and to evaluate the effects of the order of the treatments. Solid (S) and liquid (L) fractions from the process were collected for physicochemical characterization. AOE treatment showed the best capacity to extract high purity cellulose and other valuable compounds. The lignin content was significantly decreased independently of the order of the treatments and, its content in the extract obtained after the AOE process was lower than the one obtained after the OAE process. Moreover, thermal stability of the samples increased after the enzymatic process, being higher in SAOE. The alkaline treatment increased the hemicellulose and polyphenol content (antioxidant activity) in the liquid fractions (LA and LOA). In contrast, the ozonized liquid fractions had lower polyphenol content. Therefore, alkali was fundamental in the process. In conclusion, the AOE strategy could be a more environmentally friendly method for extracting cellulose and other valuable compounds, which could be used to develop active materials in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
