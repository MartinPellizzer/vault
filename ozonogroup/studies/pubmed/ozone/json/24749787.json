Monolayer G is obtained by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and transferred via poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to microfabricated Au electrodes, glass, and silicon. Post-synthesis treatments of G with PMMA and ozone (O3) showed 1 and 6 orders of magnitude decrease in film conductivity, respectively. The heterojunction formation with Au NPs had no major effect on G conductivity. In this work is demonstrated that G quenches more than 90% of the combined photoluminescence and fluorescence of Au NPs and Rhodamine B (RhB), respectively. Signal quenching permitted quantitative analysis of SERS of RhB on various substrates including as-transferred graphene, oxidized graphene (OG), and the heterojunction. While G is mainly responsible for quenching photoluminescence and fluorescence, \u223c3 orders of magnitude increase SERS activity for RhB was accomplished by the heterojunction. Finally, we wanted to correlate changes in film current during UV light sensing experiments. We found striking differences in the sensing profiles at different UV energies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicoqu\u00edmicas, Te\u00f3ricas y Aplicadas (INIFTA), Universidad Nacional de La Plata, CONICET , Sucursal 4 Casilla de Correo 16, 1900 La Plata, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Dalfovo", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lacconi", "ForeName": "Gabriela I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moreno", "ForeName": "M\u00f3nica", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yappert", "ForeName": "Marta C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sumanasekera", "ForeName": "Gamini U", "Initials": "GU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salvarezza", "ForeName": "Roberto C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iba\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "Francisco J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24749787", "10.1021/am405753t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
