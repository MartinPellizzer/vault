Experiments demonstrated that, as the control group developed grave endophthalmitis and the clinical picture deteriorated by the end of experiment, eventuating in melting of tissues both in the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, in experimental animals, to which ozonized normal saline was administered directly after infection, endophthalmitis either did not develop at all or was less severe. The anterior segment of the eyeball was not involved in the infectious process, and the changes in the vitreous body were not so grave as in the controls, and by the end of experiment the inflammation ceased completely. By the end of the infectious process in the experimental group the majority of tissue structures of the posterior pole of the eyeball, including the retina, were retained. After administration of ozonized normal saline to animals with full-blood endophthalmitis the symptoms of the inflammatory process abated and the disease took a more favorable course than in control. Hence, experiments demonstrated that even a single intravitreal instillation of ozonized solution during an infectious process brings about a high prophylactic and therapeutic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gundarova", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khoroshilova-Maslova", "ForeName": "I P", "Initials": "IP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bordiugova", "ForeName": "G G", "Initials": "GG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ilatovskaia", "ForeName": "L V", "Initials": "LV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lapina", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Eksperimental'noe obosnovanie tselesoobraznosti primeneniia ozonirovannykh fiziologicheskikh rastvorov pri vnutriglazno\u012d infektsii."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vestn Oftalmol", "NlmUniqueID": "0415216", "ISSNLinking": "0042-465X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Endophthalmitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitreous Body"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9148568"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
