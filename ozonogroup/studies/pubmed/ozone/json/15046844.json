During the period 1997-2001, forests in the Carpathian Mountains were severely affected by air pollution and natural stresses with 29.7-34.9% of the trees included in defoliation classes 2-4. The broadleaves were slightly healthier than the conifers, and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) was the least affected species. Norway spruce (Picea abies) has poor health status, with 42.9-46.6% of the trees damaged (2-4% defoliation classes). Silver fir (Abies alba) damage was also high, with 46.0-50.9% in defoliation classes 2-4. Pines (primarily Pinus sylvestris) were the least affected of the conifers, with 24.9-33.8% in defoliation classes 2-4. The results from the transnational networks (16 x 16 km) show that the Carpathian forests are slightly more damaged than the average for the entire Europe. The correlative studies performed in individual European countries show the relationships between air pollution stressors with trends in defoliation and a possible effect of natural stresses at each site. More specific, effects of tree age, drought, ozone and acid deposition critical level exceedances were demonstrated to affect crown condition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forest Research and Management Institute, Bucharest, Romania. biometrie@icas.ro"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Badea", "ForeName": "Ovidiu", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanase", "ForeName": "Mihai", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Georgeta", "ForeName": "Jianu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anisoara", "ForeName": "Lazar", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peiov", "ForeName": "Agata", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uhlirova", "ForeName": "Hana", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pajtik", "ForeName": "Josef", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wawrzoniak", "ForeName": "Jerzy", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shparyk", "ForeName": "Yuri", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Abies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15046844", "10.1016/j.envpol.2003.10.024", "S0269749103004196"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
