At an ozone mixing ratio of 250 ppb, the loss of veratraldehyde largely increased from 1.81 x 10(-6) s(-1) in the dark to 2.54 x 10(-5) s(-1) upon exposure to simulated sunlight (lambda > 300 nm). The observed rates of degradation exhibited linear dependence with the ozone in the dark ozonolysis experiments which change in the non-linear Langmuir-Hinshelwood dependence in the experiments with simultaneous ozone and light exposure of the coated particles. When the coated silica particles were exposed only to simulated sunlight in absence of ozone the loss of veratraldehyde was about three times higher i.e. 5.97 x 10(-6) s(-1) in comparison to the ozonolysis experiment under dark conditions at 250 ppb ozone mixing ratio, 1.81 x 10(-6) s(-1).These results clearly show that the most important loss of veratraldehyde occurs under simultaneous ozone and light exposure of the coated silica particles. The main identified product in the heterogeneous reactions between gaseous ozone and adsorbed veratraldehyde under dark conditions and in presence of light was veratric acid.Carbon yields of veratric acid were calculated and the obtained results indicated that at low ozone mixing ratio (250 ppb) the carbon yield obtained under dark conditions is 70% whereas the carbon yield obtained in the experiments with simultaneous ozone and light exposure of the coated particles is 40%. In both cases the carbon yield of veratric acid exponentially decayed leading to the plateau ( approximately 35% of carbon yield) at an ozone mixing ratio of 6 ppm. Two reaction products i.e. 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid were identified (confirmed with the standards) only in the experiments performed under simultaneous ozonolysis and light irradiation of the particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 d'Aix-Marseille I, II, III-CNRS, UMR 6264, Laboratoire Chimie Provence, Equipe Instrumentation et R\u00e9activit\u00e9 Atmosph\u00e9rique, Case courrier 29, 3 place Victor Hugo, F-13331 Marseille Cedex 3, France. sopheak.net@etu.univ-provence.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Net", "ForeName": "Sopheak", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gligorovski", "ForeName": "Sasho", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietri", "ForeName": "Sylvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wortham", "ForeName": "Henri", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20502834", "10.1039/b922957d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
