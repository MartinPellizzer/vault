The primary endpoint was to assess the changes of BP over 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and to evaluate the anti-hypertensive medication burden (AHMB) at 3-month follow-up. This study was registered in Chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2300071375).", "17 patients (mean age 65.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.77\u00a0years) with AHMB of 4.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.11 were enrolled. After the procedure, 7 patients (46.7\u00a0%) matched the criteria for antihypertensive medication reduction. The AHMB decreased to 3.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.96 for the whole objectives and from 3.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.96 to 3.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.78 for patients with normal baseline renal function. On top of the lessened AHMB, L-RDN further reduced morning systolic BP (SBP) by -8.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and diastolic BP (DBP) by -4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) for all participants and morning SBP by -13.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), morning DBP by -6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and daytime SBP by -4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) for those with normal baseline renal function at 3-month of follow-up.
