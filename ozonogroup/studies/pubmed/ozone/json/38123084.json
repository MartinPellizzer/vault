Additionally, the thickened effluent chromaticity and its effect on thickened sludge hydrolysis process were investigated. Ozonation in the DOF process could inactivate coliforms by oxidizing cellular components and destroying genetic material, as well as altering the chemical structure of antibiotics, leading to the degradation of antibiotics. At an O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 16\u00a0mg/g TS, the concentration of total coliforms and fecal coliforms decreased by 2.2 log and 2.4 log, corresponding to an overall removal rate of 99.4\u00a0% and 99.7\u00a0%, respectively. The total degradation rate of four target antibiotics (tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL)) were 66.5\u00a0%, 68.8\u00a0%, 53.3\u00a0% and 57.5\u00a0%, respectively. The chromaticity removal rate of the thickened effluent reached 95\u00a0%. Analysis of fluorescence spectra indicated alterations in the fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter, resulting in a decrease in fluorescence intensity by ozonation. The thickened sludge had higher hydrolysis rates, resulting in a greater production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). This was mainly attributed to the increased amount of soluble protein and carbohydrate in the substrate after DOF treatment, which was more conducive for the rapid conversion of hydrolysis into VFAs during the initial stage. These results provided new ideas for upgrading and transforming the thickening process of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
