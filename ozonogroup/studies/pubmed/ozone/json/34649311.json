The present review mainly focuses on the analysis of studies related to real industrial effluent treatment using acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation operated individually and coupled with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ozone, ultraviolet, Fenton, persulfate and peroxymonosulfate, and other emerging AOPs. The necessity of using optimum loadings of oxidants in the various AOPs for obtaining maximum COD reduction of industrial effluent have been demonstrated. The review also presents critical analysis of designs of various HCRs that have been or can be used for the treatment of industrial effluents. The impact of operating conditions such as dilution, inlet pressure, ultrasonic power, pH, and operating temperature have been also discussed. The economic aspects of the industrial effluent treatment have been analyzed. HC can be considered as cost-efficient approach compared to AC on the basis of the lower operating costs and better transfer efficiencies. Overall, HC combined with AOPs appears to be an effective treatment strategy that can be successfully implemented at industrial-scale of operation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
