Maton) seeds using ozone as a decontaminating agent. Ozone treatment was conducted 3 times, at 24-h intervals, and the parameters of the process were determined assuring the least possible losses of biologically active substances (essential oils and polyphenols): ozone concentration 160 to 165.0 g/m(3) ; flow rate 0.1 L/min; pressure 0.5 atm; time 30 min. After each step of decontamination, the microbiological profile of the cardamom seeds was studied, and the contaminating microflora was identified. Next to the microbiological profile, the total polyphenol content (TPC), composition of essential oils, free radical-scavenging capacity, total antioxidant capacity, ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and LC-MS polyphenol analysis were determined. This study shows that extract from cardamom seeds after ozone treatment is characterized by a better radical scavenging activity (IC(50) = 24.18 \u00b1 0.04 mg/mL) than the control sample (IC(50) = 31.94 \u00b1 0.05 mg/mL). The extract from cardamom seeds after ozone treatment showed an improved FRAP activity as well (613.64 \u00b1 49.79 mmol TE/g compared to 480.29 \u00b1 30.91 mmol TE/g of control sample). The TPC and the total antioxidant capacity were negatively affected, respectively, 41.2% and 16.2%, compared to the control sample."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inst. of General Food Chemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Sciences, Lodz Univ. of Technology, Lodz, Poland."}], "LastName": "Joanna Brodowska", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "\u015amigielski", "ForeName": "Krzysztof", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nowak", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brodowska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Catthoor", "ForeName": "Rik", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Czy\u017cowska", "ForeName": "Agata", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0014052", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Elettaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25182178", "10.1111/1750-3841.12591"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
