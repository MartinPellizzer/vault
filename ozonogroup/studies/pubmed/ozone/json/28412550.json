However, undesired reactions (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O reductions) may occur in competition with O<sub>2</sub> reduction at the cathode. To get a better understanding of how these side reactions would affect the process, this study investigated the cathodic reaction mechanisms during electrolysis with O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> gas mixture sparging using various electrochemical techniques (e.g., linear sweep voltammetry and stepped-current chronopotentiometry). Results show that when a carbon brush cathode was used during electrolysis with O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> sparging, H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reductions were usually negligible cathodic reactions. However, O<sub>3</sub> can be preferentially reduced at much more positive potentials (ca. 0.9\u00a0V vs. SCE) than O<sub>2</sub> (ca.\u00a0-0.1\u00a0V vs. SCE) at the carbon cathode. Therefore, cathodic O<sub>2</sub> reduction was inhibited when the process was operated under current limited conditions for cathodic O<sub>3</sub> reduction. The inhibition of O<sub>2</sub> reduction prevented the desired E-peroxone process (cathodic O<sub>2</sub> reduction to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ensuing reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>3</sub> to OH) from occurring. In contrast, when cathodic O<sub>3</sub> reduction was limited by O<sub>3</sub> mass transfer to the cathode, cathodic O<sub>2</sub> reduction to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could occur, thus enabling the E-peroxone process to enhance pollutant degradation and mineralization. Many process and water parameters (applied current, ozone dose, and reactivity of water constituents with O<sub>3</sub>) can cause fundamental changes in the cathodic reaction mechanisms, thus profoundly influencing water treatment performance during the E-peroxone process. To exploit the benefits of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in water treatment, reaction conditions should be carefully controlled to promote cathodic O<sub>2</sub> reduction during the E-peroxone process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
