Ninety percent of the surveys failed to meet current scientific standards of acceptability. The conduct and peer review of surveys has been poor and the correct injury symptoms have not always been used. Data were obtained for nine that met screening criteria and injury incidence and severity were mapped. Three fourths of the counties in the natural and planted range of eastern white pine have not been scientifically surveyed, so generalizations regarding large-scale spatial patterns of eastern white pine foliar pathological conditions were not possible. However, recent growth and inventory data indicate that growth throughout the natural range regardless of air pollution or other stresses (e.g. blister rust) is excellent, suggesting that regional performance and foliar conditions are unrelated. Sufficient compelling corroborative evidence was found to conclude that a general decline of eastern white pine throughout its range is not a tenable finding.The putative air pollution sensitivity of eastern white pine appears to be based on studies published between 1963 and 1973 on hypersensitive individuals that are no longer being observed in the field. More recent research on eastern white pine has noted a lack of sensitivity and/or high variability of response. The idea that eastern white pine as a species is highly sensitive to air pollution is no longer supported by the available evidence. However, hypersensitive juvenile individuals comprising no more than 8-9% of the total population may still germinate and grow for a brief period of time (because old enough parent trees are still alive) but soon succumb to current levels of ozone and sulfur dioxide in the environment or are suppressed by tolerant neighbors. This phenomenon has been documented anecdotally and is more aptly called tree decline instead of forest decline. An emerging working hypothesis to explain recent reports of unusual eastern white pine tolerance is that sufficient time has elapsed for tree decline to have occurred leading to a gradual elimination of sensitive genotypes from populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Research Unit, National Biological Survey, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Institute for Environmental Studies, 610 Walnus St., 53705, Madison, WI, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bennett", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mielke", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ebersole", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tree Physiol. 1987 Mar;3(1):1-15", "ArticleIdList": ["14975831"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1988;50(1-2):87-99", "ArticleIdList": ["15092654"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Jan 31;225(5231):476", "ArticleIdList": ["5411127"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24213832", "10.1007/BF00546203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
