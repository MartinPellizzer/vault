Here, we analyzed 33 steroids, including estrogens, androgens, progestins, and glucocorticoids, in hospital wastewaters, river water, and municipal wastewater treatment plant (WTP) influents and effluents at different sites in Switzerland. In addition, wastewater from different treatment steps of two WTPs with advanced treatment, such as ozonation or pulverized activated carbon, were analyzed to study the steroid's behavior during treatment. Considerable levels of different steroids occurred in hospital and raw municipal wastewater, but they were low (lower than 1 ng/L) or below the detection level in effluents of WTPs and river water. In WTP influents, estrogens (estrone, 17\u03b2-estradiol, and estriol), androgens (androstenedione, androsterone, trans-androsterone, and testosterone), progestins and metabolites (progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, mifepristone, pregnanediol, 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnanolone, 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone, and 21\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone) were detected and removed effectively during biological treatment. Ozonation further removed the steroids. Exposure of zebrafish embryos demonstrated negligible effects of pregnanediol and 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnanolone, while mixtures that mimic wastewater and river water composition affected embryo development and led to the alteration of steroidogenesis gene transcripts at nanogram per liter concentrations. Although steroid concentrations are low in Swiss rivers, the possibility of additive effects may be of concern."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, School of Life Sciences , Gr\u00fcndenstrasse 40, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, School of Life Sciences , Gr\u00fcndenstrasse 40, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanbin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3916-7196"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, School of Life Sciences , Gr\u00fcndenstrasse 40, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Systems Science, Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollution Dynamics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich (ETH Z\u00fcrich) , CH-8092 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Fent", "ForeName": "Karl", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Medical Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JR3JD1Y22C", "NameOfSubstance": "Pregnanediol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnanediol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zebrafish"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28485925", "10.1021/acs.est.7b01231"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
