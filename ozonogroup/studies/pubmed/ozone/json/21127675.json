These quantities are determined when the measured irradiances are combined with radiative transfer calculations. The method was applied to a four-channel filter instrument with center wavelengths at 305, 320, 340, and 380 nm and bandwidths of 10 nm. I compared the instrument with a high-wavelength-resolution spectroradiometer during a 1-week period in San Diego, California, with variable cloudiness. The relative difference in Commission Internationale de l'\u00c9clairage (CIE)-weighted UV dose rates for solar zenith angle's (SZA's) < 80\u00b0 was 1.4 \u00b1 3.2%. The relative difference for clear sky was 0.6 \u00b1 1.5% for SZA's < 80\u00b0. The total ozone inferred from the irradiance measurements with the filter instrument is insensitive to clouds. The instrument was compared with a Dobson and a Brewer instrument in Oslo, Norway, 60\u00b0N, for more than 1 year. The relative difference in derived ozone abundance for the entire period, including cloudy days, was 0.3 \u00b1 2.9%. The standard deviation was reduced to 1.9% when only clear sky and SZA's < 60\u00b0 were included. By using the total ozone and the cloud optical depth derived from the filter instrument as input to a radiative transfer model, one can compute a complete spectrum from 290 to 400 nm with 1-nm resolution. Such calculated spectra are in good agreement with spectra measured simultaneously with a high-wavelength-resolution spectroradiometer for clear as well as cloudy sky conditions and can be used to determine dose rates for any desired action spectrum. Only one UV-B channel and one UV-A channel are required to compute the spectra."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dahlback", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21127675", "10.1364/AO.35.006514", "46815"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
