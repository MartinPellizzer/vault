It is super-sensitive to O(3) and may produce easily recognizable symptoms for several weeks on the new, fully expanded leaves. Bel-B and Bel-C, tolerant and sensitive to O(3), respectively, are sometimes used along with Bel-W3. Information is provided on the origin and nature of these varieties. This includes their use as indicators of elevated O(3) concentrations, strength and limitations, and the inheritance and nature of resistance to O(3) in Bel-B. The varieties were the product of research initiated in 1957 to determine the cause and to reduce losses from tobacco weather fleck. Bel-C and Bel-B display the classical upper leaf surface injury; whereas, Bel-W3 develops primarily bifacial lesions. Data are provided to show differences in the amounts of acute and chronic injury on each variety when exposed to different O(3) exposure doses in controlled environments and under field conditions. There is discussion of the influence of environmental factors on response to O(3) by the varieties and the possibility of synergistic action of O(3) and SO(3) when tobacco is exposed to mixtures of these gases. The methods and results obtained with Bel-W3 in the Dutch National Monitoring Network for Air Pollution are presented in detail. Use of Bel-W3 world-wide as an indicator of elevated O(3) concentrations has been a significant factor in increasing the awareness of O(3) as a pollutant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA, ARS, Climate Stress Laboratory, Beltsville, Maryland 20705, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heggestad", "ForeName": "H E", "Initials": "HE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092056", "10.1016/0269-7491(91)90076-9", "0269749191900769"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
