Sham group: rats were treated with opening and closing abdomen. Kidney transplantation group (KT group): SD rat received the donor's left kidney derived from another SD rat. Ozone oxidative preconditioning and kidney transplantation (OOP+KT group): donor SD rats received OzoneOP treatments by transrectal insufflations before kidney transplantation. After transplantation, parameters of renal function of recipients were determined. Morphology and pathological changes of renal allograft were examined. Expression of NF-\u03baBp65, HMGB-1 were also determined by Western-blot.", "Compared to KT group, the morphology and pathological damages of renal allograft were less serious in OOP+KT group. Meanwhile, levels of SOD and GSH-Px of renal allograft in OOP+KT group were higher than those in KT group respectively. Western-blot showed that the expressions of NF-\u03baBp65 and HMGB-1 in OOP+KT group were obviously less than those in KT group.", "Ozone oxidative preconditioning could attenuate the inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress injury in renal allograft, which might be related with the enhancement of anti-oxidative system and suppression of inflammatory reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhishun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, The Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yong-Lian", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiu-Heng", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organ Transplantation, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Acta Cir Bras", "NlmUniqueID": "9103983", "ISSNLinking": "0102-8650"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemic Preconditioning"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29668774", "10.1590/s0102-865020180030000006", "S0102-86502018000300238"]}}]}
