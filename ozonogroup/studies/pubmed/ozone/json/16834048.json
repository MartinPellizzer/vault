The experimental results indicated that VX droplets could be easily and chemically transformed into other compounds under irradiation of a germicidal lamp over sufficient time. Quantum chemical calculation results demonstrated that UV light less than 278 nm wavelength could possibly initiate photoreaction of VX and that both P-S and P=O bonds in the VX molecule were lengthened. The identification of reaction products by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy and NMR revealed that the VX molecule in air under UV light irradiation could undergo isomerization of S-esters to O-esters, cleavage of P-S, S-C, and C-N bonds, and ozonation of tertiary amines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The No. 3 Department, Institute of Chemical Defence, P.O.
