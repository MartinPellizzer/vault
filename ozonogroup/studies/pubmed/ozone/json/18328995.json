It was shown that the gradient of ozone concentration in a convective-diffusion layer and consequently the rate of ozone transfer from bubbles to the solution depended on the rate of ozone decomposition both in its reaction with organic admixtures and in the conditions of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The obtained kinetic curves of destruction of organic compounds and changes of ozone concentration in water and ozone-air mixture are compared with experimental data for humic acids. The paper also analyzes additional factors affecting the kinetics of ozone dissolution and the rate of resultant reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AV Dumansky Institute of Colloid Chemistry and Chemistry of Water, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, 42 Vernadskogo av, Kyiv 03142, Ukraine. nataliya@mis.kiev.ua"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mishchuk", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goncharuk", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vakulenko", "ForeName": "V F", "Initials": "VF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Adv Colloid Interface Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8706645", "ISSNLinking": "0001-8686"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18328995", "10.1016/j.cis.2008.01.003", "S0001-8686(08)00031-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
