Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), particulate matter PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations were assessed in cities of the Sao Paulo State with a monitoring station and compared to historical data. Linear regression models were built to investigate the relationship between the isolation of the population - determined using mobile phone monitoring data - and the concentration of each pollutant during the studied period. Although the reduction of pollutants such as NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> is very clear, the economic and climatic characteristics of each region were decisive in the general behaviour of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. It was not possible to establish a correlation between the pollutants and the isolation index, partly due to the lack of data, partly due to the compliance of the population to those measurements, which was variable over time. Another important limitation factor was the absence of data related to the pollutants of interest in many of the stations. However, the isolation measures carried out in the State opened the opportunity to individually assess the air quality measurements in each of the stations, enabling an understanding that will allow in the future the design of air quality policies together with local sanitary policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
