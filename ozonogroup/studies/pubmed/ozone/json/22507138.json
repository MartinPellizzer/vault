Here we report that ozone (150\u2003nl\u2003l(-1), 5\u2003h) elicits cellular ROI production in the ozone-sensitive tobacco cv. Bel W3, but not in the tolerant cv. Bel B. Both cultivars exhibited a transient first maximum of apoplastic ROI accumulation followed by a comparable induction of glutathione peroxidase transcript levels. During postcultivation in pollutant-free air, a second and sustained peak of apoplastic ROI accumulation was detected only in cv. Bel W3. Histochemical staining revealed a spot-like accumulation of H(2)O(2) and, to a lesser extent, of superoxide anion radicals in this cultivar. The H(2)O(2) spots ('burst initiation sites') occurred mainly in the vicinity of leaf veins and correlated in number and distribution with discrete sites of local cell death and with visible symptoms that evolved between 15 and 72\u2003h. The results indicate that ozone effects are amplified in the sensitive tobacco cv. Bel W3 by an oxidative burst which participates in the generation of hypersensitive cell death-like lesions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemical Plant Pathology, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, D-85764 Oberschlei\u00dfheim, Germany, Department of Plant Pathology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA, Laboratorium voor Genetica, Department of Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, and Laboratoire Associ\u00e9 de l' Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (France), Universiteit Gent, K.L.
