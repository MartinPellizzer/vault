We hypothesised that long-term ambient air pollution exposure would be associated with differences in pulmonary vascular volumes in a population-based study.", "The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis recruited adults in six US cities. Personalised long-term exposures to ambient black carbon, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), oxides of nitrogen (NO <i><sub>x</sub></i> ), particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of <2.5\u2005\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone were estimated using spatiotemporal models. In 2010-2012, total pulmonary vascular volume was measured as the volume of detectable pulmonary arteries and veins, including vessel walls and luminal blood volume, on noncontrast chest computed tomography (TPVV<sub>CT</sub>). Peripheral TPVV<sub>CT</sub> was limited to the peripheral 2\u2005cm to isolate smaller vessels. Linear regression adjusted for demographics, anthropometrics, smoking, second-hand smoke, renal function and scanner manufacturer.", "The mean\u00b1sd age of the 3023 participants was 69.3\u00b19.3\u2005years; 46% were never-smokers. Mean exposures were 0.80\u2005\u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> black carbon, 14.6\u2005ppb NO<sub>2</sub> and 11.0\u2005\u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>.
