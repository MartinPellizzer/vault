They can also serve as a source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Field and model studies showed evidences of a strong marine biogenic influence on marine aerosols. Although knowledge of terrestrial VOC emissions and SOA formation mechanisms has been advanced considerably over the last decades, processes constraining marine VOC emissions and marine SOA formation remain poorly understood. Seawater contains an extremely complex, diverse, and largely unidentified mixture of VOCs. Despite the fact that the ocean covers 70% of the Earth's surface, the role of the ocean in the global budget of VOCs is still unclear. The distribution and emission of sea surface VOCs exhibit considerable spatial-temporal variation, with higher concentrations often, but not always, correlated with biological activities. VOCs in surface seawater have been measured in various geographic regions, however, knowledge of the distribution of marine VOCs and the role of the oceans in the global atmospheric chemistry is still insufficient due to the paucity of measurements. This study reviews marine VOCs in terms of current analytical methods, global marine VOCs measurements, their effects on SOA, and future needs for understanding the role of marine VOCs in the chemistry of the atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
