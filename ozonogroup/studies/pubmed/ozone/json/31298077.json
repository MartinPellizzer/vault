The objective of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between ambient ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels and daily number of hospital admissions for suicide attempts in Taipei for the period 2008-2012 using a time-stratified case-crossover analysis. In the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), the risk of committing a suicide attempt increased by 9% on warm days and 27% on cool days for each interquartile range (IQR) rise in O<sub>3</sub> levels, respectively. The concentration of O<sub>3</sub> was thus significantly associated with daily number of suicide attempts both on warm and cool days. In the two-pollutant models, O<sub>3</sub> levels remained significant after the inclusion of other air pollutants (particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), PM<sub>2.5</sub>, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO)) on cool days. However, on warm days, no significant correlation was found between O<sub>3</sub> levels and reported daily number of suicide attempts. The relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and suicide attempts appeared to be dependent upon temperature; however, the basis for these observations requires further investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Health Research Institute , Miaoli , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu-Tung", "Initials": "YT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Center for Big Data Analytics and Statistics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Linkou , Taoyuan , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Hui-Fen", "Initials": "HF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Suicide, Attempted"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31298077", "10.1080/15287394.2019.1640980"]}}]}
