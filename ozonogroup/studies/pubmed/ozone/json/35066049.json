Ozonation has been used to treat algal EOM, but it could not mineralize EOM effectively. In this study, mineralization and characteristics variation of EOM by vacuum ultraviolet/ozone (VUV/O<sub>3</sub>) and its sub-processes were comprehensively investigated. Results showed that EOM removal in different processes followed the order of VUV/O<sub>3</sub> > UV/O<sub>3</sub> > O<sub>3</sub> > VUV > UV. For VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process, removal efficiencies of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV<sub>254</sub>, protein, and polysaccharide at 50 min were 75.6%, 80.8%, 80.1%, and 78.0%, respectively, and fluorescence components received very high removal rates (\u226592.8%, at 10 min). The yield of trichloromethane dropped from 102.0 to 30.1 \u03bcg/L after treating for 50 min by VUV/O<sub>3</sub>. Besides, effects of O<sub>3</sub> dosage, initial pH, and water matrices on EOM removal in VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process were investigated. Moreover, fluorescent molecular probe experiments confirmed that hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical were the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process, and the transformation of ROS was proposed. The mechanism of EOM removal by VUV/O<sub>3</sub> included VUV photolysis, direct O<sub>3</sub> oxidation, and ROS oxidation. Furthermore, the removal of EOM in filtered water by VUV/O<sub>3</sub> was satisfactory. All results indicated that VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process had great application potential in treating EOM-rich filtered water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
