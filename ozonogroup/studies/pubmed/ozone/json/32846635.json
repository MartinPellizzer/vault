The disease mechanisms underlying these associations remain uncertain.", "We aim to investigate the relationship of air pollution and traffic proximity with subclinical atherosclerosis, using coronary plaque phenotypes to gain insight into potential mechanisms.", "Coronary plaque total and component volumes, high-risk plaque (HRP) appearance, and luminal stenosis were characterized by coronary computed tomography angiography in 2279 patients with atherosclerosis at baseline between 2014 and 2017. Annual average exposure to air pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was estimated by air pollution models for individual participants. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association of each exposure with plaque phenotypes and coronary stenosis, controlling for potential confounders. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate associations with plaque vulnerability.", "The studied population was 60.2\u00b19.2 years old.
