Neuronal mechanisms are known to play a key role in the initiation and modulation of airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Therefore, the nerve fibres may contribute to airway narrowing in asthma and COPD. In addition to the traditional transmitters such as norepinephrine in postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibres and acetylcholine in parasympathetic nerve fibres, a large number of neuropeptides have been identified to have different pharmacological effects on the muscle tone of the vessels and bronchi, mucus secretion and immune cells. Meanwhile, a broad range of stimuli including capsaicin, bradykinin, hyperosmolar saline, tobacco smoke, allergens, ozone, inflammatory mediators and even cold, dry air have been shown to activate sensory nerve fibres to release neuropeptides such as the tachykinins substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) to mediate neurogenic inflammation. Different aspects of the neurogenic inflammation have been well studied in animal models of chronic airway inflammation and anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium bromide (Atrovent (\u00ae)) and tiotropium bromide (Spiriva (\u00ae)) have been proved to be important when used as bronchodilators for the treatment of obstructive airway diseases such as COPD. However, little is known about the role of neurogenic airway inflammation in human diseases. In this review, we address the current knowledge of the airway sensory nerves in human asthma and COPD."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Klinik f\u00fcr Pneumologie Leiter der Arbeitsgruppe: Experimentelle Pneumologie und Allergologie Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover (MHH), Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover.
