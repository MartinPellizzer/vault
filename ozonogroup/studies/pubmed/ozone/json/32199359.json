The inventory includes data collected monthly for the period of 1960 to 2014 and at a 0.1\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.1\u00b0 latitude/longitude resolution. In an effort to evaluate and improve this emission inventory, the PKU-FUEL Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emission inventory was compared to other currently available and widely used global SO<sub>2</sub> emission inventories constructed based on bottom-up and top-down approaches, including CEDS and OMI-HTAP. While PKU-FUEL is capable of capturing SO<sub>2</sub> emissions across the globe and particularly in Asia, it misses 41 industrial point sources globally, accounting for 9.3% of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) remote sensing-measured industrial point sources. Most of these missing point sources are identified in Latin America, the Middle East (~60%), and some remote places. To improve the PKU-FUEL SO<sub>2</sub> inventory, we applied OMI-measured emissions to sources missing from PKU-FUEL. GEOS-Chem model simulations were performed to evaluate original and improved PKU-FUEL SO<sub>2</sub> inventories against measured SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations across the world. Results were further compared to GEOS-Chem modeled SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations using the CEDS inventory. We show that the modeled SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations determined using both CEDS and improved PKU-FUEL inventories to a large extent corroborate sampled data and that the improved PKU-FUEL performs better for those regions lacking monitoring data."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
