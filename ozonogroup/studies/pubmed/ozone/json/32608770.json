During the sampling period, the average concentration of atmospheric total VOCs (TVOCs) was (64.3\u00b145.6)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Alkanes were the most predominant VOC compound, accounting for 33.1% of the TVOC mass, followed by oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs, 22.3%) and halogenated hydrocarbons (21.8%). The diurnal cycles of VOCs revealed \"bimodal\" distributions. The higher concentrations of VOCs observed at 06:00-07:00 and 18:00-20:00 were attributed to the intense traffic emissions and meteorological conditions. Furthermore, maximum incremental reaction (MIR) analysis was used to estimate OFP of VOCs. The results showed that the calculated OFP in Nanjing was 267.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Aromatic hydrocarbons and alkenes were the dominant contributors to OFPs, which accounted for 55.2% and 20.8% to the total OFPs, respectively. Finally, five potential sources of VOCs were quantified by the positive matrix factorization model, including traffic emissions (34%), industrial emissions (19%), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) emissions (17%), usage of paints and solvents (16%), coal combustion, and biomass burning (14%). These findings suggested that control of vehicle emissions and industrial sources would be an important way to reduce VOC concentrations and improve air quality in Nanjing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Yale-NUIST Center on Atmospheric Environment, School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters(CIC-FEMD), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Meng-Yao", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Yale-NUIST Center on Atmospheric Environment, School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters(CIC-FEMD), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environmental Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yu-Chi", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change(ILCEC), Yale-NUIST Center on Atmospheric Environment, School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters(CIC-FEMD), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environmental Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608770", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201910154"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
