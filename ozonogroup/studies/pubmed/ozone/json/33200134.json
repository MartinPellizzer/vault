Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality, whether environmental pollutants such as ground level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established.", "To investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.", "We analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8ppm ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.", "SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells requires proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 protein and <i>Tmprss2</i> transcripts were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice.", "Our data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of this pandemic, and the challenges associated with direct testing of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe that this mice-ozone-exposure based study informs the scientific community of the potentially detrimental effects of the ambient ozone levels determining the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vo", "ForeName": "Thao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Paudel", "ForeName": "Kshitiz", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "Ishita", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Patial", "ForeName": "Sonika", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8324-2122"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saini", "ForeName": "Yogesh", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES030125", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Preprint"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "bioRxiv", "NlmUniqueID": "101680187", "ISSNLinking": "2692-8205"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Sci Rep. 2022 Jan 25;12(1):1357. doi: 10.1038/s41598-022-04906-8", "PMID": "35079032"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33200134", "PMC7668739", "10.1101/2020.11.10.377408", "2020.11.10.377408"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
