We divided the patients into two groups - those who experienced graft failure (the failure group) and those who did not experience graft failure (the no failure group) - and compared their age, height, weight, sports activity level, graft size, and muscle strength. We defined graft failure as patients who underwent revision ACL reconstruction or had a second injurious ACL episode and those with a graft grade of C or D based on the International Knee Documentation Committee score.", "The study included 232 patients (101 male, 131 female; mean age at operation was 26.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.9 years). The failure rate was 11.6% (failure group: 27 patients; no failure group: 205 patients). The patients in the failure group were younger and had higher sports activity level than those in the no failure group. (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and p\u202f<\u202f0.001, respectively). Patient body weight in the failure group was lower than that in the no failure group (p\u202f=\u202f0.047). Regarding the graft size of the tibial side, the failure group had smaller graft sizes than the no failure group (p\u202f=\u202f0.030). With respect to muscle strength, quadriceps strength 6 months after surgery in the failure group was stronger than that in the no failure group (p\u202f=\u202f0.001). In addition, the hamstring/quadriceps strength (H/Q) ratios 3 and 6 months after surgery were lower in the failure group than that in the no failure group (p\u202f=\u202f0.041 and p\u202f=\u202f0.001, respectively). There was an association between the age and the body weight, between the body weight and the graft size of the tibial side, and between lower age and high sports activity. Moreover, the high quadriceps strength at 6 months and the low H/Q ratio at 3 months were related to the low H/Q ratio at 6 months.", "Young age, high activity sports level, low body weight, small graft diameter of the tibial side, high quadriceps strength at 6 months, and low H/Q ratio at 3 and 6 months can be failure risk factors in anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction via the outside-in tunnel technique using a hamstring autograft."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation.
