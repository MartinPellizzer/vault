Our experiments were executed with whole blood specimens of healthy people (n=10). Each specimen was divided into five separate portions of 5 ml. The first portion was a control (without any exposures). The second one was processed by an oxygen-ozone mixture (at ozone concentration of 500 mcg/l, the third portion--by oxygen, and the fourth and fifth ones were processed by a gas mixture with singlet oxygen (50 and 100% of generator power). In blood samples after processing we studied the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, erythrocyte and plasma levels of glucose and lactate, acid-base balance and the partial pressure of gases in blood. It was found out, that blood processing by singlet oxygen leads to optimization of energy, detoxication and antioxidant enzymes functioning with changes in plasma and erythrocyte level of glucose and lactate, normalization of blood gases level and acid-base balance. Our results show, that the effect of singlet oxygen on enzyme activity is more pronounced than exposure to an oxygen-ozone gas mixture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martusevich", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martusevich", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Solov'eva", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peretyagin", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Biofizika", "NlmUniqueID": "0372666", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3029"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Chemical Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25702489"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
