Systemic ozone therapy involves withdrawing 100 to 200 ml of blood, treating it with an oxygen-ozone mixture, and then reinfusing it. This process requires large-caliber venous access, which can be a limitation. To overcome\u00a0this, alternative administration methods have been explored, including the use of ozonized solutions.\u00a0The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effects of systemic ozone therapy on the perception of quality of life and to analyze the outcomes of different administration methods. Three groups of patients were treated: one group received classical systemic ozone therapy, another received ozone therapy via intravenous infusion of a 5% glucose solution, and the third group alternated between the two methods. The results showed an improvement in perceived quality of life in all groups, regardless of the method used.\u00a0Thus, systemic ozone therapy showed efficacy in improving the perception of quality of life in our group. Moreover, intravenous infusion of a 5% glucose solution has made it possible to treat patients who could not be treated with the classical method, achieving similar results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Martinelli et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ozone Therapy Unit, Ospedale San Pietro Fatebenefratelli, Roma, ITA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martinelli", "ForeName": "Mauro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Ospedale San Pietro Fatebenefratelli, Roma, ITA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romanello", "ForeName": "Daniele", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
