The two microcystin variants LR and LA vary in only one amino group ie. arginine for microcystin LR and alanine for microcystin LA. In the literature to date, the general consensus has been that m-LR and m-LA should respond similarly to a range of water treatment processes. This is the case for ozonation and biodegradation by organisms colonising granular activated carbon filters; there is negligible difference in the response to these processes between the two variants. However, the adsorption of m-LR onto activated carbon is significantly higher than that of m-LA. This result is surprising as m-LA has a lower molecular weight, and is more hydrophobic, factors that would be expected to favour the adsorption of this compound over m-LR. This trend is also seen for the variants RR and YR. The effect is seen on both negatively and positively charged carbons, indicating that the difference between the variants is not caused by electrostatic interactions with the carbon surface. Electrostatic shielding experiments suggest that electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbed m-LA molecules, with a net charge of -2, may be responsible for the low adsorption. The other variants tested have a lower net charge and therefor experience lower intermolecular repulsion in the adsorbed state."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Australian Water Quality Centre, a partner in the CRC for Water Quality and Treatment, PMB 3, Salisbury, South Australia 5108, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newcombe", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cook", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brooke", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slyman", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "96180-79-9", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin-LA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EQ8332842Y", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin LR"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12703855", "10.1080/09593330309385562"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
