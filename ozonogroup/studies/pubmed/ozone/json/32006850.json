The second-order rate constants for the reaction of thiamethoxam with O<sub>3</sub> and hydroxyl radical (OH) at pH 7 were determined to be 15.4 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and 3.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The degradation pathways of thiamethoxam were proposed based on quantum chemical calculations and transformation products were identified using chromatographic and mass-spectrometric techniques. The acute and chronic toxicity of thiamethoxam and its major TPs to various aquatic organisms were assessed. With typical ozone doses applied in water treatment (\u22645\u202fmg/L), thiamethoxam was abated by only \u223c16-32 % in two real water matrices (groundwater and surface water) during single ozonation, but by \u223c100 % and >70 % during the O<sub>3</sub>/UV and EP treatment, respectively. The energy demand to abate 90 % thiamethoxam in the two water matrices was generally comparable for single ozonation and the EP process (\u223c0.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03\u202fkW\u202fh/m<sup>3</sup>), but higher for the O<sub>3</sub>/UV process (0.21-0.22\u202fkW\u202fh/m<sup>3</sup>). These results suggest that single ozonation is unable to sufficiently abate thiamethoxam under typical conditions of water treatment. Therefore, ozone-based advanced oxidation processes are needed to enhance thiamethoxam abatement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
