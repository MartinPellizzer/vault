Socio-eco-effectiveness or socio-eco-efficiency optimization plays a crucial role in future strategy establishment. Life cycle is a widely used approach examining economic, environmental, and social impacts. Recently, life cycle thinking approaches have been increasingly utilized to bring to light useful perceptions of the crop production processes. This study aims to apply a systematic review and prescriptive analytics to critically investigate the life cycle thinking approaches application according to sustainability pyramid aspects, life cycle thinking unicity, goal and scope variability, functional units' causality, system boundary' diversity, involved aspect' concentration, indicators, impacts categories and influencing variables distribution, as well as to define a first datasheet model and directive axis to apply per aspect and family for socio-eco-effectiveness or socio-eco-efficiency evaluation. Over 295 peer-reviewed studies from 2019 to the middle of 2023, 52 reviews and articles gathered from Web of Science and Scopus meet the criteria to be analyzed. Our inspection revealed that related reviews are few, approximately 2\u00a0%. Moving from the traditional life cycle perspective to the sustainability pyramid approach, the indicators applied by researchers were classified per aspect and family belonging. A deductive analysis was carried out to narrow the impact categories, and the influencing factors to the population's main interests: four economic (input status, resources consumption, waste, and Costs of Life Cycle), eight environmental (Climate Change, Global Warming, Ozone, Acidification, Eutrophication, Photochemical Oxidation, Abiotic Depletion, and Toxicity), and three social families (Human Toxicity, employment, and Ionizing Radiation). The results combination highlights the construction need for a directive datasheet model to address the optimizing problem under the identified families and aspects constraints, as well as to envisage the units and methods worldwide standardization's necessity for spatial-temporal studies comparison in the present, the past, and the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
