It is an important parameter for water utilities used to assess oxidant and/or disinfectant consumption of source waters during treatment and distribution. In this study, model compounds namely resorcinol, tannic acid, vanillin, cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were used to represent the reactive moieties of complex DOM mixtures. The reactivity of these compounds was evaluated in terms of Cl<sub>2</sub> demand and electron donating capacity (EDC). The EDC was determined by mediated electrochemical oxidation (MEO) which involves the use of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as an electron shuttle. The Cl<sub>2</sub> demand of readily oxidizable compounds (resorcinol, tannic acid, vanillin, and cysteine) was found to correlate well with EDC (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.98). The EDC values (mol e<sup>-</sup>/mol C) of the model compounds are as follows: 1.18 (cysteine)\u00a0>\u00a00.77 (resorcinol)\u00a0>\u00a00.59 (vanillin)\u00a0>\u00a00.52 (tannic acid)\u00a0>\u00a00.36 (tryptophan)\u00a0>\u00a00.19 (tyrosine). To determine the effect of pre-oxidation on EDC, ozone was added (0.1\u00a0mol O<sub>3</sub>/mol C) into each model compound solution. Ozonation caused a general decrease in EDC (10-40%), chlorine demand (10-30%), and UV absorbance (10-40%), except for tyrosine which showed both increased UV<sub>275</sub> and EDC. Before and after ozonation, 24\u00a0h disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potential tests (Cl<sub>2</sub> residual\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0mg/L) were conducted to evaluate the use of EDC for DBP formation prediction. The results indicate that there was no significant correlation between the EDC of the model compounds and the formation potentials of adsorbable organic chlorine, trichloromethane, and trichloroacetic acid. This suggests that while EDC correlates with Cl<sub>2</sub> demand, chlorine consumption may not directly translate to DBP formation because oxidation reactions may dominate over substitution reactions. Overall, this study provides useful insights on the reactions of ABTS<sup>+</sup> and HOCl with model DOM compounds, and highlights the potential application of MEO for rapid determination of Cl<sub>2</sub> demand of a water sample."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
