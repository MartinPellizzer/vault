Key functional parameters related to photosynthetic performance and stomatal density were measured to evaluate the response mechanisms of Q. ilex to chronic O3 exposure, clarifying how ecophysiological traits are modulated during the season in an ozone-enriched environment. Dark respiration showed an early response to O3 exposure, increasing approximately 45% relative to charcoal-filtered air in both O3 enriched treatments. However, at the end of the growing season, maximum rate of assimilation (Amax ) and stomatal conductance (gs ) showed a decline (-13% and -36%, for Amax and gs , respectively) only in plants under higher O3 levels. Photosystem I functionality supported the capacity of Q. ilex to cope with oxidative stress by adjusting the energy flow partitioning inside the photosystems. The response to O3 was also characterised by increased stomatal density in both O3 enriched treatments relative to controls. Our results suggest that in order to improve the reliability of metrics for O3 risk assessment, the seasonal changes in the response of gs and photosynthetic machinery to O3 stress should be considered."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fusaro", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Physics, Catholic University, Brescia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gerosa", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Salvatori", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Physics, Catholic University, Brescia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Marzuoli", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Monga", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Kuzminsky", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Angelaccio", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems (DIBAF), University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Quarato", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Council for Agricultural Research and Economics, Research Centre for the Soil-Plant System, Rome, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fares", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26307426", "10.1111/plb.12383"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
