Each team was smeared with each one of the three bacterial solutions. Then four disinfecting methods were administrated on these impressions separately, 2% glutaraldehyde immersion, 2% glutaraldehyde spray, 5% Eric immersion, 5% Eric spray. And ozone treatment was administrated on gypsum casts. Control teams were set up. After the treatment the impressions and gypsum casts were sampled at standard sites. The colonies were counted after culture and were used to deduce the germicidal ratio as the standard of disinfecting efficiency.", "There was no difference between the efficiencies of five disinfecting methods for Streptococcus sanguis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
