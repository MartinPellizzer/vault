The results showed that there was a total of 41 O<sub>3</sub> pollution processes with jumping characteristics in Beijing from 2016 to 2022, with an average of 5.9 times a year. The occurrence time was concentrated in May to July, and the day of the jump (OJD2) was higher than the day before the jump (OJD1). The average value of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) was 78.3% higher, and the peak concentration was 78.9% higher. The high O<sub>3</sub> concentration zone in the OJD2 region exhibited a characteristic of advancing from south to north. The main reasons for the occurrence of jumped O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Beijing could be summarized as local accumulation caused by unfavorable meteorological conditions and regional transmission impact. The occurrence of jump-type ozone pollution was characterized by an increase in southerly wind frequency, temperature rise, pressure decrease, and precipitation decrease. The increase in southerly wind frequency provided conditions for the transport of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, and rapid photochemical reactions occurred under local high temperatures, with less superimposed precipitation, comprehensively pushing up the ozone concentration level of OJD2. Six air mass transporting pathways were identified through clustering analysis; the air mass from the direction north of OJD2 decreased by 11.2%, whereas the air mass from the south and east directions increased by 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively, with the air masses mainly transmitting over short distances. The ozone concentration corresponding to the south and east directions was relatively high, making a significant contribution to Beijing's pollution. The analysis of potential source areas revealed that the main potential source areas of OJD2 ozone pollution were the central, southern, and eastern parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, which contributed 82.6% to the pollution trajectory. There was a significant contribution of regional transport during jump-type ozone pollution, and it is necessary to strengthen joint prevention and control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jin-Xiu", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Xin-Xin", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bao-Xian", "Initials": "BX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yun-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Qi-Hong", "Initials": "QH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Airborne Particulate Matter Monitoring Technology, Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471853", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202304048"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
