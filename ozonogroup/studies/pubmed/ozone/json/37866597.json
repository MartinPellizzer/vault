However, the evolution of OVOCs composition during vertical transport from the near surface to the upper atmosphere layer and the roles of OVOCs in the alpine atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> formation are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the carbonyl compounds, the most important chemical group of OVOCs, and other gaseous pollutants simultaneously collected at the top (2060\u00a0m a.s.l, Top) and the foot (402\u00a0m a.s.l, Foot) of Mt. Hua in August 2020. The average concentrations of the total quantified carbonyl compounds (\u2211<sub>carbonyls</sub>) at the Top and Foot were 16.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.69 and 15.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.63 ppbv, respectively. Acetone was the most abundant carbonyl (4.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.01 ppbv) at the Top, followed by formaldehyde and n-Nonanal, accounting for \u223c58.8\u00a0% of \u2211<sub>carbonyls</sub>, while formaldehyde (5.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.26 ppbv), acetone, and acetaldehyde were the three most abundant species at the Foot, accounting for 64.7\u00a0% of \u2211<sub>carbonyls</sub>. The n-Nonanal, acetone and acetaldehyde showed positive correlations between the Top and Foot during daytime, confirming the vertical transport of carbonyls from the foot to the top of Mt. Hua under the influence of valley winds. The direct emissions from vegetation, transport processes of anthropogenic emissions and photochemical oxidation contributed significantly to the measured carbonyls at the Top, especially for acetone. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal were the most important contributors to the O<sub>3</sub> generation in Mt. Hua. This study could advance our understanding of the vertical distribution of the carbonyls and the effects on O<sub>3</sub> formation in the alpine region of China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
