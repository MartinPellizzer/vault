It was found that both processes enhanced the removal rate. Especially, it has been made a further enhancement of the removal of 4, 4'-DBB as H2O2 was added under the alkaline-condition. The final removal rate of 4 mg/L 4, 4'-DBB solution reached 78.0% after reacting for 270 min, while the UV254 value varies with the removal rate and reached 76.9%-77.8% ultimately. It means that the total organic carbon has been removed obviously. Two kinds of solution of different concentration with the same amount of oxidant reacting for the same time have been compared with each other and the results showed that the higher the initial concentration was, the smaller the removal rate was, however, the more the absolute amount could be removed. It was also found that 4, 4'-DBB's removal followed pseudo-first order reaction and the promoted factor f for 4, 4'-DBB removal rate constant was about 1.54."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sonochemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jin-feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xiao-ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ping-fang", "Initials": "PF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "4,4'-di-tert-butylbiphenyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17990546"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
