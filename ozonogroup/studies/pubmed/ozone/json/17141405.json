The degradation of PNT in aqueous solution by ozonation (O(3)) combined with sonolysis (US) was investigated in laboratory-scale experiments in which pH, initial concentration of PNT, O(3) dose and temperature were varied. The degradation of PNT followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and degradation products were monitored during the process. The maximum degradation was observed at pH 10.0. As the initial concentration of PNT decreased, the degradation rate increased. Both temperature and ozone dose had a positive effect on the degradation of PNT. Of the total organic carbon (TOC) reduction, 8, 68, and 85% were observed with US, O(3), and a combination of US and O(3) after reaction for 90 min, respectively, proving that ozonation combined with sonolysis for removal of TOC is more efficient than ozonation alone or ultrasonic irradiation alone. Major by-products, including p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-(oxomethylene) cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one, but-2-enedioic acid, and acetic acid were detected by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhiqiao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Haiping", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Bosheng", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianmeng", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E88IMG14EX", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrotoluene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17141405", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.10.067", "S0304-3894(06)01293-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
