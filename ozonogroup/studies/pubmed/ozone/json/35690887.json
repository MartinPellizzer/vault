To 0.3% tea polyphenol combined with ozone water was added sodium chloride until the salt concentration reached 3.3% and with the use of an ice machine the mixture formed the tea polyphenol-ozonated slurry ice. Microbial [total viable count (TVC)], physicochemical [total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), K value], myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase activity, total sulfhydryl content, intrinsic fluorescence intensity (IFI), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were analyzed during chilled (4\u00a0\u00b0C) storage for up to 20\u2009days.", "The results showed that tea polyphenol-ozonated slurry ice could effectively inhibit the increase of TVC and TVB-N, reduce the degree of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation. In addition, the tea polyphenol-ozonated slurry ice treatment could protect the integrity of myosin in myofibrillar proteins (MPs) by inhibiting the decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase activity and the content of total sulfhydryl. Furthermore, the tea polyphenol-ozonated slurry ice presented a superiorly protective effect on protein structure in MPs as manifested by the results of IFI, FTIR and SDS-PAGE. It was possible that due to the addition of tea polyphenol, the antioxidant activity of this complex was significantly improved.", "The tea polyphenol-ozonated slurry ice treatment can maintain the quality of large yellow croaker by decreasing the damage of MP caused by the interaction between microorganisms and endogenous enzymes. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0509-4494"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Aquatic Products Processing and Storage Engineering Technology Research Center, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center for Food Science and Engineering (Shanghai Ocean University), Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Weiqing", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xuening", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3194-9273"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Aquatic Products Processing and Storage Engineering Technology Research Center, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center for Food Science and Engineering (Shanghai Ocean University), Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "19DZ2284000", "Agency": "the Ability promotion project of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission Engineering Center", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "CARS-47", "Agency": "the China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019YFD0901602", "Agency": "the National Key R&D Program of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ice"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Perciformes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Dong Z, Luo C, Guo Y, Ahmed I, Pavase TR, Lv LT et al., Characterization of new active packaging based on PP/LDPE composite films containing attapulgite loaded with Allium sativum essence oil and its application for large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) fillets.
