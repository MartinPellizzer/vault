Most studies evaluating the functional traits responses of rapid-turnover organs to O<sub>3</sub> have specifically examined leaves, despite fine roots are another major source of soil carbon and nutrient input in forest ecosystems. How elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels impact fine root biomass and biochemistry remains to be resolved. This study was to assess poplar leaf and fine root biomass and biochemistry responses to five different levels of O<sub>3</sub> pollution, while additionally examining whether four levels of soil N supplementation were sufficient to alter the impact of O<sub>3</sub> on these two organs. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> resulted in a more substantial reduction in fine root biomass than leaf biomass; relative to leaves, more biochemically-resistant components were present within fine root litter, which contained high concentrations of lignin, condensed tannins, and elevated C:N and lignin: N ratios that were associated with slower rates of litter decomposition. In contrast, leaves contained more labile components, including nonstructural carbohydrates and N, as well as a higher N:P ratio. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly reduced labile components and increased biochemically-resistant components in leaves, whereas they had minimal impact on fine root biochemistry. This suggests that O<sub>3</sub> pollution has the potential to delay leaf litter decomposition and associated nutrient cycling. N addition largely failed to affect the impact of elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels on leaves or fine root chemistry, suggesting that soil N supplementation is not a suitable approach to combating the impact of O<sub>3</sub> pollution on key functional traits of poplars. These results indicate that the significant differences in the responses of leaves and fine roots to O<sub>3</sub> pollution will result in marked changes in the relative belowground roles of these two litter sources within forest ecosystems, and such changes will independently of nitrogen load."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
