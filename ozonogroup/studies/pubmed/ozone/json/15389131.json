The reactive oxygen species are known to induce platelet aggregation, the process involved in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. In the present study, the influence of ozonated autohaemotherapy (O3-AHT) on the platelet function was evaluated in chronically haemodialysed patients with peripheral arterial disease.", "This was an oxygen-controlled, cross-over study, in which nine sessions of autohaemotherapy with oxygen administration as a control were followed by nine sessions of O3-AHT. The platelet function was assessed by the extent of spontaneous aggregation (SPA) and agonist-induced aggregation (AIPA), where different concentrations of adenosine were used as an agonist.", "There were no differences between SPA and AIPA assessed after nine sessions of O3-AHT and after nine sessions of autohaemotherapy with oxygen administration.
