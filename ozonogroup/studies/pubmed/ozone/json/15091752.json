Dynamic, chemical, and microphysical aspects are reviewed with emphasis on chemistry. The questions addressed are as follows. Do we have a quantitative understanding of the Antarctic ozone hole? What lies behind the trend of slowly decreasing ozone columns over northern mid-latitudes? To what degree was chemistry responsible for the extremely low ozone levels over northern Europe in January 1992? The discovery of the ozone hole in 1985 exposed scientific neglect of the category of fast heterogeneous reactions taking place on particulate matter in the stratosphere. But even now after the wide acceptance of some heterogeneous reactions it is difficult to fully account for the rate at which Antarctic ozone is depleted each year in August. After reviewing the known heterogeneous reactions, possible hitherto unrecognised mechanisms are briefly outlined. The paper also includes a discussion of the chemical reactions which can occur even under relatively warm conditions on the ubiquitous, stratospheric aerosol particles and which could contribute to the observed mid-latitudinal ozone depletion. Finally, the paper underlines the importance of dynamic processes, that is, horizontal transport and vertical adiabatic motion, which appear to be the main cause of the anomalously low northern hemispheric ozone values during the 1991/1992 winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, PO Box 3060, 6500 Mainz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peter", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091752", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)90024-8", "0269749194900248"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
