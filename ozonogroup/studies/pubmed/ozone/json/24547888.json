This is possibly due to secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) formed from reactions between ozone and volatile organic compounds emitted from art products. Four brands of markers, three scented and one unscented, were tested inside a stainless steel chamber at eight different ozone concentrations between 0 and 300\u00a0ppb. Out of the 32 tested markers, only the lemon- and orange-scented markers from one brand reacted with ozone to form UFPs. Limonene, pinene, and several other terpenes were identified as ingredients of ink in SOA-forming markers. Coloring with one lemon-scented marker for 1\u00a0min without ozone generated on average approximately 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0ppb of limonene inside the chamber. At 150\u00a0ppb ozone, using one lemon marker for 1\u00a0min formed on average 7.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(10) particles. The particle size distribution indicated an initial mode of 15\u00a0nm which grew to 40\u00a0nm. At 50\u00a0ppb ozone and below, no significant SOA formation occurred. The number of particles formed is moderately correlated with the mass of ink used (R(2) \u00a0=\u00a00.68). Based on these data, scented markers are not likely a strong source of SOA under normal indoor ozone levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
