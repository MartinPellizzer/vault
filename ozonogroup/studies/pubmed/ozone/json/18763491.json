It was found that the dimethoate degradations under the individual ultrasonic radiation treatment without O3 (US), the oxidation of O3 gas (O3) and the synergetic effect of UALR and O3 (UALR/O3) were all consonant with the apparent first-order reaction by the kinetics investigations. The dimethoate removal rates of US, O3 and UALR/O3 methodologies under the conditions of dimethoate initial concentration of 50 mg/L, initial solution pH of 6.0, dimethoate solution volume of 80 mL, ultrasonic intensity of 0.5 W/cm2, O3 flow of 200 L/h, temperature of 20 degrees C and the treatment time of 4 h were 27%, 15% and 90%, respectively. Under these conditions, the rate constant enhancement factor of dimethoate degradation reached 4.816. Furthermore, a simplified mechanistic kinetic model was derived from the degradation mechanism of the synergetic effect of US, O3 and hydroxyl free radical (*OH) in the UALR/O3 system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Sonochemical Engineering, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing 210009, China. liuyuenan067000@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yue-nan", "Initials": "YN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Xiao-ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ping-fang", "Initials": "PF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W6U08B045O", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethoate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethoate"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18763491"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
