Although UV radiation would be also a driving force for the biological evolution of life on Earth, life space of the primitive living organisms would be limited in the UV-shielded place such as in the water at an early stage of the evolution of life. After the formation of stratospheric ozone layer through the production of oxygen by photoautotroph, living organisms were able to expand their domain from water to land. As a result, now, many kinds of living organisms containing human beings are flourishing on the ground. In the near future, increased transmission of harmful solar UV radiation may reach the Earth's surface due to stratospheric ozone layer depletion. In order to learn more about the biological effects of solar UV radiation with or without interruption by the ozone layer, the utilization of an Exposed Facility on the International Space Station is required. Experiments proposed for this facility would provide a tool for the scientific investigation of processes involved in the birth and evolution of life on Earth, and could also demonstrate the importance of protecting the Earth's future environment from future ozone layer depletion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, Kashihara, Nara, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Akihisa", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Takeo", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Sci Space", "NlmUniqueID": "100972048", "ISSNLinking": "0914-9201"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Melanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.99.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Evolution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Melanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Musa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Spacecraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15858393", "10.2187/bss.18.255", "41804008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
