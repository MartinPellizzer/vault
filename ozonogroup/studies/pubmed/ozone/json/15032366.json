Derivatization efficiencies >90% were achieved over a wide range of solution concentrations. The major compounds identified by GC-mass spectrometry of the derivatized products of alkene-O3 reactions were alpha-methoxyalkyl hydroperoxides, methyl esters, and aldehydes. Yields of alpha-methoxyalkyl hydroperoxides and methyl esters were quantified using effective carbon numbers (ECNs) and used to determine the yields of stabilized Criegee intermediates (SCIs) from gas-phase ozonolysis reactions. Such measurements are important for understanding the atmospheric chemistry of alkene emissions. SCI yields measured for the reactions of 1-octene [CH3(CH2)5CH=CH2], 1-nonene [CH3(CH2)6CH=CH2 ], and 2-methyl-1-octene [CH3(CH2)5C(CH3)=CH2] are consistent with previous measurements or predictions based on literature data. SCI yields measured for the reactions of 1-decene [CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2], 1-dodecene [CH3 (CH2)9CH=CH2], and 1-tetradecene [CH3(CH2)11CH=CH2] are much lower than expected, apparently due to side reactions with low volatility aldehydes that form peroxyhemiacetals, which are not amenable to GC analysis. In general, the results indicate that off-line MSTFA derivatization can be an efficient means for increasing the stability of thermally labile hydroperoxides for identification and quantitation by GC, and offers a new approach for the analysis of these environmentally important compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Research Center and Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Docherty", "ForeName": "Kenneth S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumboonlert", "ForeName": "Kalyada", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Isaac J", "Initials": "IJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziemann", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trimethylsilyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PG7JD54X4I", "NameOfSubstance": "cumene hydroperoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trimethylsilyl Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15032366", "10.1016/j.chroma.2003.12.014", "S0021-9673(03)02268-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
