Once released into the atmosphere, 1,3-butadiene (BD) reacts with hydroxyl radicals and ozone (created by photochemical processes), to produce many identified and unidentified products. Once this transformation has occurred, the toxic potential of atmospheric pollutants such as BD in the ambient environment is currently unclear. During this study, environmental irradiation chambers (also called smog chambers), utilizing natural sunlight, were used to create photochemical transformations of BD. The smog chamber/in vitro exposure system was designed to investigate the toxicity of chemicals before and after photochemical reactions and to investigate interactions with the urban atmosphere using representative in vitro samples. In this study, we determined the relative toxicity and inflammatory gene expression induced by coupling smog chamber atmospheres with an in vitro system to expose human respiratory epithelial cells to BD, BDs photochemical degradation products, or the equivalent ozone generated within the photochemical mixture. Exposure to the photochemically generated products of BD (primarily acrolein, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, furan and ozone) induced significant increases in cytotoxicity, IL-8, and IL-6 gene expression compared to a synthetic mixture of primary products that was created by injecting the correct concentrations of the detected products from the irradiation experiments. Interestingly, exposure to the equivalent levels of ozone generated during the photochemical transformation of BD did not induce the same level of inflammatory cytokine release for either exposure protocol, suggesting that the effects from ozone alone do not account for the entire response in the irradiation experiments. These results indicate that BDs full photochemical product generation and interactions, rather than ozone alone, must be carefully evaluated when investigating the possible adverse health effects to BD exposures. The research presented here takes into account that photochemical transformations of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) does generate a dynamic exposure system and therefore provides a more realistic approach to estimate the toxicity of ambient air pollutants once they are released into the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, CB #7431, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. doylem@email.unc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doyle", "ForeName": "Melanie", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sexton", "ForeName": "Kenneth G", "Initials": "KG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeffries", "ForeName": "Harvey", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaspers", "ForeName": "Ilona", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JSD5FGP5VD", "NameOfSubstance": "1,3-butadiene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16860297", "10.1016/j.cbi.2006.05.016", "S0009-2797(06)00139-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
