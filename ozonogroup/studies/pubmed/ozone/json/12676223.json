During the 2000, 2001, and 2002 ozone seasons, the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) employed a four-pronged, multimedia approach to educate the public about air quality in the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) region. The four-pronged approach included several varied information sources:The new Air Pollution Watch/Warning system based on public health and designed using standard meteorological terminology with notices delivered via e-mail, over the radio, during TV weather forecasts, and on electronic road signs.A revamped Web page, including information about current air quality, ozone exceedances, clean air public meetings, and how to \"Do Your Share for Cleaner Air\".A PowerPoint presentation used to explain the basics of ozone air pollution, the new Air Pollution Watch/Warning system, and the new Dallas/Fort Worth Clean Air Plan to a variety of constituencies, including the media, scientific/technical/academic groups, elected officials, and community/civic organizations. Newsletter updates, published in the Environmental Resources Department's InsidER (with a circulation of around 1500), to educate and keep the public up-to-date about various air quality issues. This paper provides details about the four-pronged approach, and how it incorporates principles of successful public education campaigns."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, 75202, Dallas, TX, USA. ce_main@ncsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stuckey", "ForeName": "H Troy", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sattler", "ForeName": "Melanie L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Int", "NlmUniqueID": "7807270", "ISSNLinking": "0160-4120"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community-Institutional Relations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Knowledge"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multimedia"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Program Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12676223", "10.1016/S0160-4120(02)00167-8", "S0160-4120(02)00167-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
