To date, analysis of intra-urban variability of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, and the influence of local controls on production and depletion rates, has been limited due to the low spatial and/or temporal resolution of measurements. We demonstrate that measurements made using a carefully managed multi-sensor network of low-cost gas-sensitive semiconductor instruments are sufficiently precise to resolve subtle but significant variations in ozone concentration across a region. Ozone was measured at 12 sites in the isolated subtropical city of Auckland, New Zealand. Overall O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the Auckland region were low (annual mean: 19ppb) across all seasons, with a minimum in summer. Higher O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (max. 57ppb) were observed when wind speeds were >5ms<sup>-1</sup> and from the W/SW, and were associated with maritime air masses. Ozone formation in the Auckland region is low, which is attributed to a combination of the low O<sub>3</sub> background concentrations, the negligible contribution of long-range transport and the effect of NOx titration. Intra-urban variability showed that the lowest O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were measured at the residential sites, particularly at night and during rush hours. Ozone depletion from reaction with traffic-generated NO explains the rush-hour minima but did not fully account for the low night-time values. The results suggest that night-time depletion may result from other processes such as the reaction of ozone with nitrite on surfaces such as concrete, pointing towards the need for further studies concerning the rate and mechanism of dry deposition at night in urban areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
