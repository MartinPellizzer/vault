Few studies have examined lung function in relation to industrial emissions of air pollutants.", "This cross-sectional study was based on 2,833 respondents aged 6 to 18 for whom spirometry data were collected by the Canadian Health Measures Survey, 2007 to 2011. The weighted sum of industrial air emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) within 25 km of the respondent's residence was derived using National Pollutant Release Inventory data. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the relationship between NO\u2093 and PM2.5 emissions and forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV\u2081), and the ratio of the two (FEV\u2081/FVC).", "Industrial air emissions of NO\u2093 were not significantly associated with lung function among males or females. Emissions of PM2.5 were negatively associated with FEV\u2081 and FEV\u2081/FVC, but not FVC, among males. PM2.5 was not significantly related to lung function among females.", "The associations that emerged between lung function and industrial emissions of PM2.5 among males were consistent with airway obstruction. Further research is warranted to investigate the gender differences observed in this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Analysis Division, Statistics Canada, Ottawa, Ontario."}], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Suzy L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario."}], "LastName": "Coates", "ForeName": "Allan L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario."}], "LastName": "To", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Health Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9012854", "ISSNLinking": "0840-6529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Obstruction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26885839", "82-003-X201600214312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
