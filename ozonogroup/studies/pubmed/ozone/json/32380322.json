The membrane acts as a barrier between the two phases and mass transfer occurs by diffusion and not by dispersion. This article is a review of the application of membrane contactor technology for ozonation applied to water treatment. The challenge of removing micropollutants is also discussed. In the first part, the ozonation process is mentioned, in particular chemical reactions induced by ozone and its advantages and disadvantages. In the second part, generalities on membrane contactor technology using hollow fibers are presented. Then, the benefit of using a membrane contactor for the elimination of micropollutants is shown through a critical analysis of the influence of several parameters on the ozonation efficiency. The impact of the membrane material is also highlighted. Finally, several modeling approaches are presented as a tool for a better understanding of the phenomena occurring in the contactor and a possible optimization of this process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
