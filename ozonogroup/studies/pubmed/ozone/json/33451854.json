The nano-ozone bubble significantly increased ozone mass transfer rate compared to that of the macro-ozone bubble. The half-life of nano-ozone bubbles was 23 times longer than that of the nano-ozone bubbles. Due to the high ozone mass transfer rate and its durability, the nano-ozone bubble increased the TMAH degradation rate compared to that of the macro-ozone. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> significantly increased the TMAH degradation rate constant by OH production during the nano-ozone bubbles/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. The optimum conditions for TMAH removal was 25\u202f\u00b0C and pH 10. Within 90\u202fmin of the nano-ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, TOC removal was 65 % while 80 % of nitrogen was converted into nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) with 95 % of TMAM removal. Decreases in acute (40-fold) and chronic (2-fold) toxicity were achieved after applying the nano-ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process to TMAH containing wastewater. However, there was no significant chronic toxicity decrease during the nano-ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process of TMAH."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
