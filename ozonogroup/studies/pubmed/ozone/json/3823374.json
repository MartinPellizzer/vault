In particular, different spruces had been exposed before to well-defined doses and concentrations of ozone and SO2. In addition to spectral distributions and time courses of fluorescence intensity, fluorescence lifetimes were detected after picosecond laser pulse excitation. Time constants of tau 1 = (0.10 +/- 0.02) ns and tau 2 = (0.50 +/- 0.10) ns were measured for intact photosynthesis; an increase of tau 2 and a further time constant tau 3 = (2.5 +/- 0.5) ns were found, if defects within the photosynthetic system occurred. Most significant defects were so far measured after exposition to high ozone doses during longer time periods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schneckenburger", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frenz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Radiat Environ Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0415677", "ISSNLinking": "0301-634X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3823374", "10.1007/BF01214642"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
