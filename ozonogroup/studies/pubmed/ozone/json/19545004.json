The effects of intensity of UV radiation, initial concentration of MCLR, dosages of H2O2 and ozone, initial pH value of the solution and anions on degradation of MCLR were studied. The pH value and carbonate (or bicarbonate) concentration varieties during the reaction were discussed. A concise model based on the first order model was raised. The results reveal that in UV/H2O2 system (including UV alone), the average value of the pseudo first and second order kinetics correlation coefficient R2 are 0.927 and 0.827 respectively. In the ozone treatment process, the average valve of the first and second order kinetic correlation coefficient R2 are 0.911 and 0.925 respectively; at the same time, the accuracy of modified model was proved to be better, the average value of R2 in UV/H2O2 (including UV alone) and ozone system are up to 0.982 and 0.985 respectively. Meanwhile, it can be concluded from the model that: when the initial UV radiation, H2O2 dosage and the ozone dosage were set, pH value and carbonate (or bicarbonate) concentrations were the two main aspects which influenced the reaction rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China. lilei87296281@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Nai-Yun", "Initials": "NY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Di-Di", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ke-Jia", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jian-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EQ8332842Y", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin LR"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19545004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
