The AWT train successfully met the goals of CECs and bulk organics removal. The microbial community at each treatment step of the AWT train was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform generated from DNA extracted from liquid and solid (treatment media) samples taken along the treatment train. Differences in the microbial community structure were observed. The dominant operational taxonomic units (OTU) decreased along the treatment train, but the treatment steps did impact the microbial community composition downstream of each unit process. These results provide insights into microbial ecology in advanced water treatment systems, which are influenced and shaped by each treatment step, the microbial community interactions, and their potential metabolic contribution to CECs degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
