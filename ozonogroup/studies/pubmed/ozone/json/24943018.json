There were 12 mice in the groups of 200 \u03bcg/mouse and 10 mice in others. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after four intratrachealinstillations. The activities of catalase (CAT) in serum and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in lung tissue homogenate were measured. As the DNA damage mark, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine and serum were quantified with ELISA method. Micronucleus test was used for potential genotoxicity of BC and O\u2083-BC. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to stain lung paraffin section.", "The mice were in good condition during instillation, and the liver coefficient of the test groups was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). The activities of CAT in serum significantly increased in the 100 \u03bcg/mouse and 200 \u03bcg/mouse groups after being exposed to these two kinds of particles. The micronucleus rate in allthe BC and O\u2083-BC exposed groups increased (P<0.05), but there was no statistically significant difference among the groups in the levels of 8-OHdG in serum and urine and MDA in lung tissue homogenate. Inflammatory response was found in the lung tissue under the microscope after exposure to BC and O\u2083-BC.", "Intratracheal instillation of BC and O\u2083-BC induced increasing of oxidative stress and genetic damage in mice. But there was no significant difference between these two particles in toxicity. Whether the genotoxicity of O\u2083-BC is higher than that of BC or not is uncertain. Further research is needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jing-lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Yuan-jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-xiao", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Xian-guo", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban", "NlmUniqueID": "101125284", "ISSNLinking": "1671-167X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24943018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
