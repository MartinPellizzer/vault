Past studies have reported supportive evidence, but evidence from China is scarce and does not integrate the different periods of the pregnancy course. In this study, 1945 pregnant women with HDP and healthy pregnancies between 2016 and 2022 from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University registry network database were analysed. The geographic information, biological information and demographic information of the case were fused in the analysis. Machine learning methods were used to obtain the weight of the variable. Then, we used the generalized linear mixed model to evaluate the relationship between increased exposure to each pollutant at different periods of HDP and examined it in different groups. The results showed that SO<sub>2</sub> had the predominate impact (12.65\u202f%) on HDP compared with other air pollutants. SO<sub>2</sub> exposure was associated with an increased risk of HDP. Increased unit SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were accompanied by an increased risk of HDP (OR = 1.33, 95\u202f% CI: 1.13, 1.566), and the susceptible window for this effect was mainly in the first trimester (OR = 1.242, 95\u202f% CI: 1.092, 1.412). In addition, SO<sub>2</sub> exposure was associated with an increased risk of HDP in urban maternity (OR = 1.356, 95\u202f% CI: 1.112, 1.653), obese maternity (OR = 3.58, 95\u202f% CI: 1.608, 7.971), no higher education maternity (OR = 1.348, 95\u202f% CI: 1.065, 1.706), nonzero delivery maternity (OR = 1.981, 95\u202f% CI: 1.439, 2.725), maternal with first time maternity (OR = 1.247, 95\u202f% CI: 1.007, 1.544) and other groups. In summary, SO<sub>2</sub> exposure in early pregnancy is one of the risk factors for HDP, and the increased risk of HDP due to increased SO2 exposure may be more pronounced in obese, urban, low-education, and nonzero delivery populations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
