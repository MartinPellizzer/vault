Rice protein concentration, which is closely associated with eating/cooking quality, is of critical importance to nutritional quality. The ozone effect on amino acids of rice grains was little known, especially grown under different cultivation conditions. A hybrid rice cultivar Shanyou 63 was grown in 2010 and 2011 to investigate the interactive effect of ozone exposure and planting density on rice protein quality in a free-air ozone enrichment system.", "The content of protein, total amino acids (TAA), total essential (TEAA) and non-essential amino acids (TNEAA) in rice grain was increased by 12-14% with elevated ozone. A similar significant response to ozone was observed for concentrations of the seven essential and eight non-essential amino acids. In contrast, elevated ozone caused a small but significant decrease in percentage of TEAA to TAA. The year effect was significant for all measured traits; however, interactions of ozone with year or planting density were not detected.", "The study suggested that season-long elevation of ozone concentration to projected 2050 levels will increase protein and amino acids of Shanyou 63, and crop management such as changing planting density might not alter the impact."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agricultural Meteorology, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiaodong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yunxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lianxin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yulong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hybridization, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24700274", "10.1002/jsfa.6684"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
