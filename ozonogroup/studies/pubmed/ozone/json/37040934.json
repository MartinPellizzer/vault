The results showed that:\u2460 there was a synergistic change in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. When <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>_mean) \u2264 85 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, for every 10 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> increase in <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>_mean), the peak of the mean value of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>_perc90) increased by 9.98 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. When <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>_mean) exceeded the national Grade II standards of (35\u00b110) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, the peak of the mean value of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>_perc90) increased the fastest, with an average growth rate of 11.81%. In the past six years, on average, 74.97% of Chinese cities with compound pollution had a <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>_mean) in the range of 45 to 85 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. When <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>_mean)>85 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, the mean value of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>_perc90) showed a significant decreased trend. \u2461 The spatial clustering pattern of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Chinese cities was similar, and hot spots of the six-year mean values of <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>_mean) and <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>_perc90) were distributed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration and other cities in the Shanxi, Henan, and Anhui provinces. \u2462 The number of cities with PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> compound pollution showed an interannual variation trend of increasing first (2015-2018) and then decreasing (2018-2020) and a seasonal trend of gradually decreasing from spring to winter. Further, the compound pollution phenomenon mainly occurred in the warm season (April to October). \u2463 The spatial distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> compound polluted cities was changing from dispersion to aggregation. From 2015 to 2017, the compound polluted areas spread from the eastern coastal areas to the central and western regions of China, and by 2017, a large-scale polluted area centered on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central Plains urban agglomeration, and surrounding areas was formed. \u2464 The migration directions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentration centers were similar, and there were obvious trends of moving westward and northward. The problem of high-concentration compound pollution was concentrated and highlighted in cities in central and northern China. In addition, since 2017, the distance between the centers of gravity of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the compound polluted areas had been significantly reduced, with a reduction of nearly 50%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xiao", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Yan-Mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Jia-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information System, Ministry of Education, School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Yangtze University, Wuhan 430100, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37040934", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
