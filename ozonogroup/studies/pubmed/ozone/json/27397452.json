IOC is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and postoperative morbidity. The impact of IOC on outcome cannot be assessed by a randomized control design.", "The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and impact of IOC on the outcome in patients undergoing OPCAB.", "Three tertiary care level hospitals; retrospective observational study.", "This retrospective observational study included 1971 consecutive patients undergoing\u200a OPCAB from January 2012 to October 2015 at three tertiary care level hospitals by four surgeons. The incidence, patient characteristics, cause of IOC, and its impact on outcome were studied.", "The cohort was divided into two groups according to IOC. Univariate logistic regression was performed to describe the predictors of IOC. Variables that were found to be significant in univariate analysis were introduced into multivariate model, and adjusted odds ratio (OR) was calculated. To further assess the independent effect of IOC on mortality, propensity score matching with a 5:1 ratio of non-IOC to IOC was performed.", "The overall all-cause in-hospital mortality was 2.6%. IOC was needed in 128 (6.49%) patients. The mortality in the IOC group was significantly higher than non-IOC group (21 of 128 [16.4%] vs. 31 of 1843 [1.7%], P = 0.0001). The most common cause for IOC was hemodynamic disturbances during grafting to the obtuse marginal artery (51/128; 40%). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, left main disease, pulmonary hypertension, and mitral regurgitation independently predicted IOC. We obtained a propensity-matched sample of 692 patients (No IOC 570; IOC 122), and IOC had OR of 16.26 (confidence interval 6.3-41; P < 0.0001) for mortality in matched population.", "Emergency IOC increases odds for mortality by 16-fold.
