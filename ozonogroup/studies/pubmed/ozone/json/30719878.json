Air pollution may have an impact on incidence and severity of SDB in children. The aims of this study were to examine potential associations between the exposure to different air pollutants and SDB symptoms in children.", "In this cross-sectional study, parents from first grade children of elementary schools throughout Chile were included. Data about clinical and family-related SDB risk factors, and the pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) were obtained. Air pollution and meteorological data were obtained from the Chilean online air quality database.", "A total of 564 children (44.9% males) aged (median) 6 years (5-9 year) were included. Prevalence of SDB based on PSQ was 17.7%. When examining air pollutants and conditions, only higher humidity (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.005, 95%CI 0.001-0.009, P\u2009=\u20090.011) was significantly associated with higher PSQ scores after adjusting for demographic and household variables.

Lower temperature was a significant predictor of snoring at least >3 nights/week, following adjustment (OR\u2009=\u20090.865, 95%CI 0.751-0.997, P\u2009<\u20090.05).", "Sleep respiratory symptoms (wheezing and snoring) are significantly associated with air pollutants such as O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> .
