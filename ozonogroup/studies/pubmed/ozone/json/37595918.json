However, the 3 most applied disinfection technics, which are chlorine, ultraviolet (UV), and ozone disinfection, all have their disadvantages of selecting undesired bacteria and low energy utilization efficiency. Electrode disinfection is a promising solution, but the current electrode disinfection process still needs to be optimized in terms of the use conditions of the configuration reactivation. In this paper, we built a flow electrode system (FES). To evaluate the disinfection techniques more precisely, we isolated ultraviolet-resistant bacteria (URB) bacteria from the water of the full-scale water plant and tested the disinfection performance of FES and UV. The inactivation rate, reactivation potential, and energy consumption were analyzed. FES could inactivate 99.99\u00a0% of the URB and cause irreversible damage to the residual bacteria. FES could make all bacteria strains apoptosis in the subsequent 24\u00a0h of storage after alternating pulse current (APC) treatment, 3\u00a0V, within 27.7\u00a0s. Besides, the energy consumption of FES is about 2 orders lower than that of UV disinfection under the same inactivation rate. In summary, APC-FES is an efficient and low-carbon alternative for future water disinfection, which could achieve the ideal disinfection effect of a high inactivation rate, no reactivation, and low energy consumption."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
