This study investigates whether short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> is associated with asthma emergency department (ED) visits. <i>Methods</i>: We identified 1,101 ED visits in June-September of 2015 in SJV, California, who lived within 15\u2009km of active air monitors. Conditional logistic regression models were used to obtain the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with an interquartile (IQR) increase in ozone. We explored the potential effect modification by sex (female and male), race (White, Black and Hispanic), age (2-5, 6-18, 19-40, 41-64 and >\u2009= 65) and county (Merced, Madera, Kings, Fresno and Kern). <i>Results</i>: An IQR range (18.1\u2009ppb) increase in O<sub>3</sub> exposure three days before an asthma attack (lag 3) was associated with a 6.6% [OR: 1.066 (95% CI: 1.032, 1.082)] increase in the odds of having an asthma ED visit. The overall ORs differed across age groups and races/ethnicities, with strongest for children aged 6-18\u2009years [OR: 1.219 (95% CI: 1.159, 1.280)], adults 19-40\u2009years [OR: 1.102 (95% CI: 1.053, 1.154)] and Blacks [OR: 1.159 (95% CI: 1.088, 1.236)], respectively. O<sub>3</sub> exposure was not positively associated with asthma ED visits for Whites, while it was for other underrepresented groups. Fresno had the highest number of asthma ED visits and positive association among all five counties. <i>Conclusion</i>: We found that O<sub>3</sub> exposure is associated with asthma ED visits in the SJV."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gharibi", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Entwistle", "ForeName": "Marcela R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "Sandie", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5078-6759"], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "Mariaelena", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, Clovis, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schweizer", "ForeName": "Donald", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Institute, University of California, Merced, CA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cisneros", "ForeName": "Ricardo", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30299181", "10.1080/02770903.2018.1523930"]}}]}
