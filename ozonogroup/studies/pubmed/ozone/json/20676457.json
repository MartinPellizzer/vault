[Atmos. Chem. Phys., 2007, 7, 3055] has highlighted significant inconsistencies between laboratory results, theoretical calculations and field observations concerning the ClO dimer ozone destruction cycle. This work investigates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant of one of the key reactions in this cycle, ClO + ClO + M <=> Cl(2)O(2) + M (1, -1), by means of laser flash photolysis and time-resolved UV absorption spectroscopy. ClO radicals were generated via laser flash photolysis of Cl(2)/Cl(2)O mixtures in synthetic air. Radicals were monitored via UV absorption spectroscopy: the use of a charge coupled device (CCD) detector allowed time resolution over a broad range of wavelengths giving unequivocal concentrations of radicals. The equilibrium constant K(eq) was determined as the ratio of the rate constants of the forward and reverse over the temperature range T = 256.55-312.65 K. Second Law and Third Law thermodynamic methods were employed to determine the standard enthalpy and entropy changes of , \u0394(r)H\u00b0 and \u0394(r)S\u00b0, from the measured equilibrium constants. The values obtained from Second Law analysis were \u0394(r)H\u00b0 = - 80.7 \u00b1 2.2 kJ mol(-1) and \u0394(r)S\u00b0 = -168.1 \u00b1 7.8 J K(-1) mol(-1). Third Law analysis gave \u0394(r)H\u00b0 = -74.65 \u00b1 0.4 kJ mol(-1) and \u0394(r)S\u00b0 = -148.0 \u00b1 0.4 J K(-1) mol(-1). These values are in good agreement with previous work by Nickolaisen et al. [J. Phys. Chem., 1994, 98, 155] but greater in (negative) magnitude than current JPL-NASA recommendations [Sander et al., Chemical Kinetics and Photochemical Data for Use in Atmospheric Studies, JPL Publication 06-2, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, 2006 (interim update to this reference, 2009)]. The discrepancy between the Second and Third Law analyses also agrees with Nickolaisen et al., possibly indicating an aspect of the ClO recombination reaction not yet fully elucidated. The atmospheric implications of the results and their impact on the current understanding on polar ozone depletion are briefly discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories, 20 Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AJ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferracci", "ForeName": "Valerio", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowley", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20676457", "10.1039/c0cp00308e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
