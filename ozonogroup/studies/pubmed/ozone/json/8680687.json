Symptom questionnaires were administered before and after exposure, and pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, and specific airway resistance [SRaw]) were performed before, during, and immediately after each exposure. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with proximal airway lavage (PAL) of the isolated left main bronchus and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; bronchial fraction, the first 10 ml of fluid recovered) of the right middle lobe, was performed 18 h after each exposure. The PAL, bronchial fraction, and BAL fluids were analyzed for the following endpoints: total and differential cell counts; total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibronectin, interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta 2) concentrations. We found a significant O3 effect on FEV1, FVC, SRaw (p < 0.04) and lower respiratory symptoms (p < 0.001) for the asthmatic subjects. Ozone exposure also significantly increased the percent neutrophils in PAL (p < 0.01); percent neutrophils, total protein, and IL-8 in the bronchial fraction (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively); and the percent neutrophils, total protein, LDH, fibronectin, IL-8, GM-CSF, and MPO in BAL (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively) for the asthmatic subjects. There were no significant differences in the lung function responses of the asthmatic subjects in comparison with a group of normal subjects (n = 81) previously studied using an identical protocol, although there was a trend toward a greater O3-induced increase in SRaw in the asthmatic subjects (p < 0.13). In contrast, the asthmatic subjects showed significantly greater (p < 0.05) O3-induced increases in several inflammatory endpoints (percent neutrophils and total protein concentration) in BAL as compared with normal subjects who underwent bronchoscopy (n = 20). Our results indicate that asthmatic persons may be at risk of developing more severe O3-induced respiratory tract injury/inflammation than normal persons, and may help explain the increased asthma morbidity associated with O3 pollution episodes observed in epidemiologic studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lung Biology Center, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California 94143-0854, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scannell", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aris", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tager", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christian", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrando", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welch", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy, Needle"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8680687", "10.1164/ajrccm.154.1.8680687"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
