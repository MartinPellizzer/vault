This work aims at developing an active sampling method to monitor these compounds (i.e. 6 straight-chain saturated aldehydes from C6 to C11; 8 straight-chain alkanes from C9 to C16; 6 monoterpenes: \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, camphene, limonene, \u03b1-terpinene, & \u03b3-terpinene; and 5 aromatic compounds: toluene, ethylbenzene, meta-, para- and ortho-xylenes) in remote areas. Samples are collected onto multi-bed sorbent cartridges at 200 mL min(-1) flow rate, using the automatic sampler SyPAC (TERA-Environnement, Crolles, France). No breakthrough was observed for sampling volumes up to 120 L (standard mixture at ambient temperature, with a relative humidity of 75%). As ozone has been shown to alter the samples (losses of 90% of aldehydes and up to 95% of terpenes were observed), the addition of a conditioned manganese dioxide (MnO(2)) scrubber to the system has been validated (full recovery of the affected compounds for a standard mixture at 50% relative humidity--RH). Samples are first thermodesorbed and then analysed by GC/FID/MS. This method allows suitable detection limits (from 2 ppt for camphene to 13 ppt for octanal--36 L sampled), and reproducibility (from 1% for toluene to 22% for heptanal). It has been successfully used to determine the diurnal variation of the target compounds (six 3 h samples a day) during winter and summer measurement campaigns at a remote site in the south of France."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille Nord de France, F-59000 Lille, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Detournay", "ForeName": "Ana\u00efs", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sauvage", "ForeName": "St\u00e9phane", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Locoge", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaudion", "ForeName": "Vincent", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leonardis", "ForeName": "Thierry", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fronval", "ForeName": "Isabelle", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaluzny", "ForeName": "Pascal", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Galloo", "ForeName": "Jean-Claude", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21327227", "10.1039/c0em00354a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
