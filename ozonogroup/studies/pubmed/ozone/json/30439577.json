The L-GQS, with a density of 2.36\u202fg\u202fcm<sup>-3</sup> and average diameter of ca. of 4\u202fmm, was readily churned up and uniformly distributed within the solution in the reactor. The introduction of L-GQS was found to exhibit enhanced catalytic ozonation of atrazine, with the increase in degradation rate and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal being more than 2-fold for the catalytic process (L-GQS dosage\u202f=\u202f5\u202fg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>, [atrazine]<sub>0</sub>\u202f=\u202f50\u202f\u03bcM, [O<sub>3</sub>]\u202f=\u202f25\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>, gas flow\u202f=\u202f0.2\u202fL\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup>, at pH 7.0 and 293\u202fK). The L-GQS settled at the bottom of the reactor after experimentation, allowing its easy separation from the solution. A complete characterization of the material (XRD, XPS, FTIR, FE-SEM/EDS, BET and pH<sub>pzc</sub>) revealed that L-GQS consisted of \u03b1-quartz, \u03b2-cristobalite, anorthoclase and small amount of iron oxy-hydroxides. Hydroxyl groups, Bronsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites on the surface of L-GQS all contributed to the atrazine adsorption, ozone decomposition and \u00b7OH generation. The L-GQS catalyzed ozonation exhibited superior atrazine degradation and mineralization rates in a wide range of pH (3.0-9.0) and reaction temperatures (278\u202fK-293\u202fK). Also, an enhancement of DOC abatement was observed both in presence of natural organic matter isolates and natural water matrices (river water) when L-GQS was used. Finally, the degradation mechanism was proposed, based on the intermediates and by-products formation analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS/MS and ionic chromatography. Our results indicate that the L-GQS combined with stirring-assisted bubble column reactor could be utilized as an enhancement of ozone-based advanced oxidation processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
