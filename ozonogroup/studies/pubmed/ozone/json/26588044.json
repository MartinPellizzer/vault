The concentration of particulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed in eight homes and was found to be lower inside (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.e.\u00a0=\u00a01.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0nmol/m<sup>3</sup> ) than outside (2.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0nmol/m<sup>3</sup> ). Indoor particulate ROS concentrations were substantial and a major fraction of indoor particulate ROS existed on PM<sub>2.5</sub> (58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010%), which is important from a health perspective as PM<sub>2.5</sub> can carry ROS deep into the lungs. No obvious relationships were evident between selected building characteristics and indoor particulate ROS concentrations, but this observation would need to be verified by larger, controlled studies. Controlled experiments conducted at a test house suggest that indoor ozone and terpene concentrations substantially influence indoor particulate ROS concentrations when outdoor ozone concentrations are low, but have a weaker influence on indoor particulate ROS concentrations when outdoor ozone concentrations are high. The combination of substantial indoor concentrations and the time spent indoors suggest that further work is warranted to assess the key parameters that drive indoor particulate ROS concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
