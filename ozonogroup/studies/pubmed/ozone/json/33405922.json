Methane and acetonitrile were used as reference compounds to measure the rate coefficients of the title reactions. For the reactions of HF2M2P with OH radicals and Cl atoms, the rate coefficients were measured to be (7.07 \u00b1 1.21) \u00d7 10<sup>-15</sup> and (2.85 \u00b1 0.54) \u00d7 10<sup>-14</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, at 298 K. The obtained Arrhenius expressions for the reactions of HF2M2P with OH radicals and Cl atoms are <i>k</i><sub>HF2M2P\u00a0+\u00a0OH</sub><sup>Exp\u00a0-\u00a0(268\u00a0-\u00a0363\u00a0K)</sup> = (7.84 \u00b1 0.75) \u00d7 10<sup>-14</sup> exp [-(717 \u00b1 59)/<i>T</i>] and <i>k</i><sub>HF2M2P\u00a0+\u00a0Cl</sub><sup>Exp\u00a0-\u00a0(268\u00a0-\u00a0363\u00a0K)</sup> = (3.21 \u00b1 0.45) \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> exp [-(1395 \u00b1 83)/<i>T</i>] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. In addition to the experimental measurements, computational kinetic calculations were also performed for the title reactions at the M06-2X/MG3S//M06-2X/6-31 + G(d,p) level of theory using advanced methods such as the canonical variational transition-state theory coupled with small curvature tunneling corrections at temperatures between 200 and 400 K. Theoretical calculations reveal that the H-abstraction from the CH<sub>3</sub> group is a more favorable reaction channel than that from the OH group. Thermochemistry, branching ratios, cumulative atmospheric lifetime, global warming potential, acidification potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential of HF2M2P were calculated in the present investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Avinash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Gonu", "ForeName": "Srinivasulu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Samrat Ashok Technological Institute, Vidisha 464001, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Vijayakumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Ramya", "ForeName": "C B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Rajakumar", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33405922", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c08130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
