However, some sulfur containing VOCs, such as dimethyl sulfide, may deactivate the Pt catalyst that is commonly used in the catalytic incineration process. This paper provides information on the poisoning effect of (CH3)2S. The catalytic incineration of (CH3)2S, typically emitted from the petrochemical industry, over a Pt/Al(2)O(3) fixed bed catalytic reactor was studied. The effects of operating parameters including inlet temperature, space velocity, (CH3)2S concentration, O2 concentration and catalyst size were characterized. Catalytic incineration on a mixture of (CH3)2S with CH(3)SH was also tested. The results show that the conversions of (CH3)2S increase as the inlet temperature increases and the space velocity decreases. The higher the (CH3)2S concentration is, the lower its conversion is. The O2 concentration has a positive effect on the conversion of (CH3)2S. (CH3)2S has a poisoning effect on the Pt/Al(2)O(3) catalyst, especially at lower temperatures. The conversion of (CH3)2S is significantly suppressed by the existence of CH(3)SH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, 1 University Road, Tainan 70101, Taiwan. chuhsin@mail.ncku.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "W T", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horng", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tseng", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QS3J7O7L3U", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incineration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11165060", "10.1016/s0304-3894(00)00351-4", "S0304-3894(00)00351-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
