Ground-level ozone pollution has become a concerning environmental problem because of the harm it poses to human health and the surrounding ecological environment. However, current studies on chemical precursors of ozone mainly focus on emissions from industrial sources, forest vegetation, and urban vehicle exhaust; by contrast, few studies have examined the role of the soil environment on NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs emissions. In addition, the soil environment is complex and heterogeneous. Agricultural activities (fertilization) and atmospheric deposition provide nutrients for the soil environment, with a significant effect on NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs emissions. There is thus a need to study the environmental factors related to the release of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs in the soil to enhance our understanding of emission fluxes and the types of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs in the soil environment and aid efforts to control ground-level ozone pollution through appropriate measures such as management of agricultural activities. This paper reviews the generation of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs in the soil environment and the effects of various environmental factors on this process. Some suggestions are provided for future research on the regulation of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs emissions in the soil environment and the ability of the soil environment to contribute to ground-level ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
