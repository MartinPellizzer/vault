This program simulates the actual physical situation, since a real atmospheric model was used, i.e., one that contained both aerosol and Rayleigh scattering as well as ozone absorption. The complete interaction of the radiation field with the ocean was also taken into account. The chlorophyll was assumed to be uniformly mixed in the ocean and was also assumed to act only as an absorbing agent. For the ocean model both scattering and absorption by hydrosols was included. Results have been obtained for both a very clear ocean and a medium turbid ocean. Recommendations are made for optimum techniques for remotely sensing chlorophyll both in situ and in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kattawar", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Humphreys", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20155215", "10.1364/AO.15.000273", "19893"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
