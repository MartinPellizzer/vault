However, the reaction of NH<sub>3</sub> and OH to generate NH<sub>2</sub> and its subsequent reactions are often ignored in the MOZART-4 chemical mechanism. To solve this problem, the gas-phase chemical mechanism of NH<sub>3</sub> was updated in this study. Response surface methodology (RSM), integrated gas-phase reaction rate (IRR) diagnosis and process analysis (PA) were used to quantify the influence of the updated NH<sub>3</sub> chemical mechanism on the O<sub>3</sub> simulated concentration, the nonlinear response relationship of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, the chemical reaction rate of O<sub>3</sub> generation and the meteorological transport process. The results show that the updated NH<sub>3</sub> chemical mechanism can reduce the error between the simulated and observed O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and better simulate the O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Compared with the Base scenario (original chemical mechanism simulated), the first-order term of NH<sub>3</sub> in the Updated scenario (updated NH<sub>3</sub> chemical mechanism simulated) in RSM passed the significance test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that NH<sub>3</sub> emissions have an influence on the O<sub>3</sub> simulation, and the effects of the updated NH<sub>3</sub> chemical mechanism on NOx-VOC-O<sub>3</sub> in different cities are different. In addition, the analysis of chemical reaction rate changes showed that NH<sub>3</sub> can affect the generation of O<sub>3</sub> by affecting the NOx concentration and NOx circulation with radicals of OH and HO<sub>2</sub> in the Updated scenario, and the change of pollutant concentration in the atmosphere leads to the change of meteorological transmission, eventually leading to the reduction of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Beijing. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of atmospheric chemistry for air quality models to model atmospheric pollutants and should attract more research focus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
