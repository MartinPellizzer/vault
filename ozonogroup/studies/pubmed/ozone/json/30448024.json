Bryophytes are the dominant flora in the Antarctic continent. However, the molecular mechanism of Antarctic moss adaptation to UV-B radiation remains unclear. In the research, the transcriptional profiling of the Antarctic moss Pohlia nutans under UV-B radiation was conducted by Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Totally, 72,922 unigenes with N<sub>50</sub> length of 1434 bp were generated. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that 581 unigenes were markedly up-regulated and 249 unigenes were significantly down-regulated. The gene clustering analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) includes several transcription factors, photolyases, antioxidant enzymes, and flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes. Further analyses suggested that the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of several antioxidant enzymes (i.e., catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) were significantly enhanced upon UV-B treatment. Furthermore, the content of flavonoids and the gene expression levels of their synthesis-related enzymes were also markedly increased when plants were exposed to UV-B light. Therefore, these results suggested that the pathways of antioxidant enzymes, flavonoid synthesis and photolyases were the main defense systems that contributed to the adaption of Pohlia nutans to the enhanced UV-B radiation in Antarctica."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
