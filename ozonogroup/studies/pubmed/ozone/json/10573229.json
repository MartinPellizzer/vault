The study population comprised bleachery workers (n=56) from a Swedish pulpmill carrying out ozone-based pulp bleaching since 1992 and controls (n=39). Both groups were investigated by measuring NO in exhaled air, methacholine challenge test and answers to a questionnaire concerning history of respiratory symptoms and accidental exposure to ozone peaks. There was no significant difference in NO output between exposed subjects and controls (median 67.2 versus 55.0 nL x min(-1), p=0.64). However, among bleachery workers reporting ozone gassings, the median NO output was 90.0 nL x min(-1) compared to 58.8 nL x min(-1) among those not reporting such incidents (p=0.019). There was no relation between exhaled NO and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In a multiple regression model, only reported ozone gassings were associated (p=0.016) with NO output. The results indicate an association between previous response to ozone gassing and nitric oxide output. The increased nitric oxide output among the bleachery workers reporting peak ozone exposure may indicate that chronic airway inflammation is present. Further studies are needed to evaluate the extent to which nitric oxide can be used for biological monitoring of respiratory health effects, and to relate it to other markers of airway inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olin", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ljungkvist", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bake", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hagberg", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henriksson", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tor\u00e9n", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8061YMS4RM", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorine dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10573229", "10.1034/j.1399-3003.1999.14d18.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
