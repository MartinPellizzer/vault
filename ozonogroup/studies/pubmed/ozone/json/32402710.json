In response to implementation of the Plan, daytime PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm) showed significant downward trends from 2015 to 2019, with the largest reduction during spring and winter in the North China Plain. Unlike PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> (ozone) showed a general increasing trend, reaching 29.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> on summer afternoons. Increased O<sub>3</sub> and reduced PM<sub>2.5</sub> simultaneously occurred in more than half of Chinese cities, increasing to approximately three-fourths in summer. Declining trends in both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> occurred in only a few cities, varying from 19.1% of cities in summer to 33.7% in fall. Meteorological variables helped to decrease PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in some cities and increase PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in others, which is closely related to terrain. High wind speed and 24\u00a0h changing pressure favored PM<sub>2.5</sub> dispersion and dilution, especially in winter in southern China. However, O<sub>3</sub> was mainly affected by 24\u00a0h maximum temperature over most cities. Soil temperature was found to be a key factor modulating air pollution. Its impact on PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations depended largely on soil depth and seasons; spring and fall soil temperature at 80\u00a0cm below the surface had largely negative impacts. Compared with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> was more significantly affected by soil temperature, with the largest impact at 20\u00a0cm below the surface and with less seasonal variation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
