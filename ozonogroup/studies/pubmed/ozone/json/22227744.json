In this work, we present the application of mass spectrometric techniques for the quantification of short-lived iodine-containing volatiles emitted by eight different seaweeds from the intertidal zone of Helgoland, Germany. A previously developed online time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometric method was used to determine I(2) emission rates and investigate temporally resolved emission profiles. Simultaneously, iodocarbons were preconcentrated on solid adsorbent tubes and quantified offline using thermodesorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The total iodine content of the seaweeds was determined using microwave-assisted tetramethylammonium hydroxide extraction followed by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry analysis. The highest total iodine content was found in the Laminariales, followed by the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus serratus, and both red algae Chondrus crispus and Delesseria sanguinea. Laminariales were found to be the strongest I(2) emitters. Time series of the iodine release of Laminaria digitata and Laminaria hyperborea showed a strong initial I(2) emission when first exposed to air followed by an exponential decline of the release rate. For both species, I(2) emission bursts were observed. For Laminaria saccharina und F. serratus, a more continuous I(2) release profile was detected, however, F. serratus released much less I(2). A. nodosum and F. vesiculosus showed a completely different emission behavior. The I(2) emission rates of these species were slowly increasing with time during the first 1 to 2 h until a more or less stable I(2) emission rate was reached. The lowest I(2) emission rates were detected for the red algae C. crispus and D. sanguinea. Total iodocarbon emission rates showed almost the same general trend, however, the total iodocarbon emission rates were about one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of molecular iodine, demonstrating that I(2) is the major iodine containing volatile released by the investigated seaweed species. In addition, a clear dependency of iodocarbon emission from the ozone level (0-150 ppb O(3)) was found for L. digitata."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz, Duesbergweg 10-14, 55099 Mainz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kundel", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thorenz", "ForeName": "Ute R", "Initials": "UR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petersen", "ForeName": "Jan H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ru-Jin", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bings", "ForeName": "Nicolas H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoffmann", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Laminaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seaweed"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22227744", "10.1007/s00216-011-5658-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
