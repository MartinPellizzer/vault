Foundry sludge and olive mill waste have been used as industrial waste materials with organic or mixed character. Stabilisation/solidification (S/S) and advanced oxidation (AOP) processes have been carried out in order to treat both foundry sludge and olive mill waste. Analysis of ecotoxicity, total organic carbon, COD and phenol index have been evaluated in the untreated waste and end-products. The results of the treated samples allow obtaining the best formulations in both processes. The best formulations in the immobilisation process have been obtained with Portland cement and black carbon, activated carbon or foundry sand ashes. In the AOP process, ozone concentrations above 35 mg/l and reaction times equal to 120 minutes have been the optimal variables. The relationships between the organic parameters and the ecotoxicity of the samples have been studied in this paper. Furthermore, the global organic parameters have been studied in relation to the phenolic compounds. Lineal and logarithmic expressions have been obtained between the total organic carbon and phenol index and the ecotoxicity of the samples related to the organic parameters, respectively. Ecotoxicity of the samples with Vibrio fischeri is recommended as a very promising biotest for the study of the characterisation and the evaluation of the treatment of organic and mixed character waste and total organic carbon is recommended as global organic parameter in the treatment of foundry sludge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Inorganic Chemistry, Universidad de Cantabria, Avda Los Castros s/n Santander, Spain. coza@unican.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coz", "ForeName": "Alberto", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mantzavinos", "ForeName": "Dionisis", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karageorgos", "ForeName": "Petros", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalogerakis", "ForeName": "Nikolas", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andr\u00e9s", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Viguri", "ForeName": "Javier R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Irabien", "ForeName": "Angel", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Ann Chim", "NlmUniqueID": "7610375", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aliivibrio fischeri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17172203", "10.1002/adic.200690052"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
