Using TROPOMI-L3 NO<sub>2</sub>, HCHO products, and ERA5-land high-resolution data as estimation variables, an XGBoost-LME model was constructed to estimate the near-surface ozone concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. The results showed that\uff1a \u2460 Through correlation analysis, surface 2 m temperature \uff08T2M\uff09, 2 m dewpoint temperature \uff08D2M\uff09, surface solar radiation downwards \uff08SSRD\uff09, tropospheric formaldehyde \uff08HCHO\uff09, and tropospheric nitrogen dioxide \uff08NO<sub>2</sub>\uff09 were important factors affecting the near-surface ozone concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. Among them, T2M, SSRD, and D2M had strong correlations, with correlation coefficients of 0.82, 0.75, and 0.71, respectively. \u2461 Compared with that of other models, the XGBoost-LME model had the best performance in terms of various indicators. The ten-fold cross-validation evaluation indicators <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, MAE, and RMSE were 0.951, 9.27 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and 13.49 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. At the same time, the model performed well at different time scales. \u2462 In terms of time, there was a significant seasonal difference in near-surface ozone concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region in 2019, with the concentration changing in the order of summer &gt; spring &gt; autumn &gt; winter. The monthly average ozone concentration in the region showed an inverted \"V\" trend, with a slight increase in September. The highest value occurred in July, whereas the lowest value occurred in December. In terms of spatial distribution, the near-surface ozone concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region during the months of February and March were generally at the same levels. In January, November, and December, there was a relatively insignificant trend of higher concentrations in the north and lower concentrations in the south. For the remaining months, the spatial distribution of near-surface ozone concentrations in this area predominantly exhibited a pattern of higher concentrations in the south and lower concentrations in the north. High-value areas were predominantly found in the plain regions of the southern part with lower altitudes, dense population, and higher industrial emissions\uff1b low-value areas, on the other hand, were primarily located in mountainous areas of the northern part with higher altitudes, sparse population, higher vegetation coverage, and lower industrial emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mining College, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "De-Cai", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mining College, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mining College, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mining College, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xian-Yun", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mining College, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mining College, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hong-Fei", "Initials": "HF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39022930", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202307110"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
