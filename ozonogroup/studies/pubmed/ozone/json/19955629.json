In this process, HA and DCB were removed by joint effect of catalytic ozonation and bentonite coagulation. HA removal was highly dependent on the coagulation process while DCB removal was dependent on the oxidation process in COBC. Iron in solution not only acted as a coagulant, but also promoted the formation of HO, which is effective in destroying aromatic chemicals. Bentonite in COBC improved the coagulation process, resulting in an enhancement in the treating efficiency. COBC is proved to be potentially advantageous on dissolved pollutants in drinking water, and appears to have great potential for a wide range of practical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution Control Technologies, Xixi Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310028, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xingwang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Lecheng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xianjun", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1302-78-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Bentonite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6PJ93I88XL", "NameOfSubstance": "2-dichlorobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bentonite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19955629", "10.2166/wst.2009.678"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
