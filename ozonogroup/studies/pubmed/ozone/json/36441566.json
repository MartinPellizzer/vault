However, the reaction of Fe(VI) with organic nitrogen, which is a potential precursor of potent nitrogenous DBPs, remains largely unexplored. The present work aimed to identify the kinetics and products for the reaction of Fe(VI) with primary amines, notably amino acids. A new kinetic model involving ionizable intermediates was proposed and can describe the unusual pH effect on the Fe(VI) reactivity toward primary amines and amino acids. The Fe(VI) oxidation of phenylalanine produced a mixture of nitrile, nitrite/nitrate, amide, and ammonia, while nitroalkane was an additional product in the case of glycine. The product distribution for amino acids significantly differed from that of uncarboxylated primary amines that mainly generate nitriles. A general reaction pathway for primary amines and amino acids was proposed and notably involved the formation of imines, the degradation of which was affected by the presence of a carboxylic group. In comparison, ozonation led to higher yields of nitroalkanes that could be readily converted to potent halonitroalkanes during chlor(<i>am</i>)ination. Based on this study, Fe(VI) can effectively mitigate primary amine-based, nitrogenous DBP precursors with little formation of toxic halonitroalkanes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6452-2209"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju61005, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Roug\u00e9", "ForeName": "Valentin", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju61005, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Pham Thi Thai Ha", "Initials": "PTTH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6937-4671"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Land and Water, Floreat6014, Australia."}], "LastName": "Allard", "ForeName": "S\u00e9bastien", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5923-4897"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju61005, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yunho", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16836-06-9", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrate ion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36441566", "10.1021/acs.est.2c03319"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
