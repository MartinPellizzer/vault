While historically the use of MF/UF for water and wastewater treatment has been almost exclusively focused on polymeric membranes, new generation ceramic membranes were recently introduced in the market and they possess unique advantages over currently available polymeric membranes. Ceramic membranes are mechanically superior and are more resistant to severe chemical and thermal environments. Due to the robustness of ceramic membranes, strong oxidants such as ozone can be used as pretreatment to reduce the membrane fouling. This paper presents results of a pilot study designed to investigate the application of new generation ceramic membranes for WWTP effluent treatment. Ozonation and coagulation pretreatment were evaluated to optimize the membrane operation. The ceramic membrane demonstrated stable performance at a filtration flux of 100 gfd (170LMH) at 20 degrees C with pretreatment using PACl (1mg/L as Al) and ozone (4 mg/L). To understand the effects of ozone and coagulation pretreatment on organic foulants, natural organic matter (NOM) in four waters - raw, ozone treated, coagulation treated, and ozone followed by coagulation treated wastewaters - were characterized using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The HPSEC analysis demonstrated that ozone treatment is effective at degrading colloidal NOMs which are likely responsible for the majority of membrane fouling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MWH Americas, Inc., National Technology Group, Arcadia, CA 91007, USA. geno.lehman@mwhglobal.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lehman", "ForeName": "S Geno", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19269666", "10.1016/j.watres.2009.02.003", "S0043-1354(09)00081-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
