The quality of parsley treated with different concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW was investigated during storage at 20 \u2103 for 5 d, and found that a ten-minute exposure of parsley to 2.5\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW effectively preserved the sensory quality of parsley, and resulted in lower weight loss, respiration rate, ethylene production, MDA levels, and a higher level of firmness, vitamin C, and chlorophyll content, relative to untreated parsley. The O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW treatment also increased the level of total phenolics and flavonoids, enhanced peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase activity, and inhibited polyphenol oxidase activity in stored parsley. Five volatile signatures identified using an electronic nose (W1W, sulfur-compounds; W2S, ethanol; W2W, aromatic- and organic- sulfur compounds; W5S, oxynitride; W1S, methane) exhibited a significant decrease in response to the O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW treatment. A total of 24 major volatiles were identified. A metabolomic analysis identified 365 differentially abundant metabolites (DMs). Among them, 30 and 19 DMs were associated with characteristic volatile flavor substance metabolism in O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW and control groups, respectively. The O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW treatment increased the abundance of most DMs related to flavor metabolism and reduced the level of naringin and apigenin. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms that are regulated in response to the exposure of parsley to O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW, and confirmed the potential use of O<sub>3</sub>-MNBW as a preservation technology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
