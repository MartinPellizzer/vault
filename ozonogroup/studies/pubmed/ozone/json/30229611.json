The effect of O<sub>3</sub> on the removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Spectral Absorption Coefficient (UV<sub>254</sub>) were investigated. The characteristics of organic matter and the microbial consortium structure of BAC were also investigated at 20 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> of O<sub>3</sub> dosage concentration, 40 min of O<sub>3</sub> single stage contact time and 1.5 h of the empty bed residence time of BAC. Results showed that the effluent COD concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-BAC was 24 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> with the removal efficiency of 40.4%. The COD removal efficiency of O<sub>3</sub>-BAC was higher than that for the BAC process. The UV<sub>254</sub> removal efficiency of O<sub>3</sub>-BAC was 55.1%. Meanwhile, UV<sub>254</sub> correlated with COD with a correlation coefficient of 0.89. The percentage of dissolved organic matters with relative molecular weight less than 1\u00d710<sup>3</sup> increased from 69.0% to 87.0% after O<sub>3</sub> oxidation. The NPOC removal efficiency of O<sub>3</sub>-BAC (45.8%) was higher than that of the BAC process (23.0%). The NPOC removal efficiency of the BAC unit was mainly achieved by reduction of dissolved organic matters with relative molecular weight less than 1\u00d710<sup>3</sup>. GC-MS analysis results showed that organic substances such as alkanes, unsaturated esters, and phenols had been removed by O<sub>3</sub> oxidation. The micro ecological environment of the BAC unit had been significantly improved after O<sub>3</sub> oxidation, and the genera with relative abundance over 1.0% increased from 6 to 11. The combined O<sub>3</sub>-BAC system can be applied to the advanced treatment of petrochemical treated water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Ming-Hao", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Dan-Ning", "Initials": "DN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Ming-Zhe", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Affairs, Tianjin Petrochemical Company of Sinopec, Tianjin 300271, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Bei-Bei", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Affairs, Tianjin Petrochemical Company of Sinopec, Tianjin 300271, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jing-Mei", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Consortia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30229611", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201801276"]}}]}
