We investigated the effects of advanced oxidation pretreatment methods usually applied for removing dissolved organic matters on residual Al control. Results showed that the presence of humic acid increased residual Al concentration notably. With 15 mg/L of humic acid in raw water, the concentrations of soluble aluminum and total aluminum in the treated water were close to the quantity of Al addition. After increasing coagulant dosage from 12 to 120 mg/L, the total-Al in the treated water was controlled to below 0.2 mg/L. Purification systems with ozonation, chlorination, or potassium permanganate oxidation pretreatment units had little effects on residual Al control; while UV radiation decreased Al concentration notably. Combined with ozonation, the effects of UV radiation were enhanced. Optimal dosages were 0.5 mg O3/mg C and 3 hr for raw water with 15 mg/L of humic acid. Under UV light radiation, the combined forces or bonds that existed among humic acid molecules were destroyed; adsorption sites increased positively with radiation time, which promoted adsorption of humic acid onto polymeric aluminum and Al(OH)3(s). This work provides a new solution for humic acid coagulation and residual Al control for raw water with humic acid purification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China. wwd@xauat.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wendong", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Zhenzhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaochang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22125899", "10.1016/s1001-0742(10)60520-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
