RNase activity typically increases in response to pathogen attack, wounding and phosphate (P(i)) deficiency. Activity also increases during senescence and other programmed cell death processes. The air pollutant ozone (O(3)) often induces injury and accelerated senescence in many plants, but the biochemical mechanisms involved in these responses remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether RNase activity and isozyme expression was stimulated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flag leaves following treatment with O(3). Plants were treated in open-top chambers with charcoal-filtered air (27 nmol O(3) mol(-1)) (control) or non-filtered air plus O(3) (90 nmol O(3) mol(-1)) (O(3)) from seedling to reproductive stage. After exposure for 56 days, RNase activity was 2.1 times higher in flag leaf tissues from an O(3)-sensitive cultivar in the O(3) treatment compared with the control, which generally coincided with foliar injury and lower soluble protein concentration, but not soluble leaf [P(i)]. Soluble [P(i)] in leaf tissue extracts from the O(3) and control treatments was not significantly different. RNase activity gels indicated the presence of three major RNases and two nucleases, and their expression was enhanced by the O(3) treatment. Isozymes stimulated in the O(3) treatment were also stimulated in naturally senescent flag leaf tissues from plants in the control. However, soluble [P(i)] in extracts from naturally senescent flag leaves was 50% lower than that found in green flag leaves in the control treatment. Thus, senescence-like pathological responses induced by O(3) were accompanied by increased RNase and nuclease activities that also were observed in naturally senescent leaves. However, [P(i)] in the leaf tissue samples suggested that O(3)-induced injury and accelerated senescence was atypical of normal senescence processes in that P(i) export was not observed in O(3)-treated plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality - Plant Growth and Development Research Unit, and Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, 3908 Inwood Road, Raleigh, NC 27603, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "Fitzgerald L.", "Initials": "FL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15032859", "10.1111/j.0031-9317.2004.0238.x", "PPL238"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
