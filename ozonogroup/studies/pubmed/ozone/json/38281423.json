Accurate estimates of biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions is essential for understanding the formation mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution and precise reduction on anthropogenic emissions and thereby mitigating O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution. To gain comprehensive knowledge of BVOC emissions and improve the accuracy of their estimation, this study reviewed localized national, regional, and municipal emission estimations in China. From their comparisons, BVOC emission characteristics and deficiencies in the inventory compilation methodology were also investigated. The estimated BVOC emissions in China ranged between 10 and 58.9\u00a0Tg\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> and 10.9-18.9\u00a0Tg\u00a0C yr<sup>-1</sup>, with diverse contributions for different BVOC categories. The simulated historical and future BVOC emissions exhibited an increasing trend. The uncertainty of the BVOC estimates was mainly from the applications of incomplete emission models, less localized accurate emission factors, deficient vegetation cover information, and low-resolution meteorological data in the inventory compilation. The regional and municipal BVOC emission inventories mainly focused on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Pearl River Delta, Sichuan Basin, and Yangtze River Delta regions, as well as the cities therein. For the same area, different studies reported diverse BVOC emissions by a maximum of two orders of magnitude. There is usually a lack of basic data with more detailed investigations and higher precision for estimation of BVOC emissions. By summarizing the measurements on terrestrial and marine BVOC emission fluxes, they are mainly focused on the Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, and Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea, respectively. Expanding the temporal and spatial scales of observations is encouraged to enhance our understanding on the emissions and improve the emission estimates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
