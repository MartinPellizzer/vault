The initial concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde in air ranged from 8 to 20 and from 2.9 to 7.2 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The photochemical kinetic mechanism was proposed for a numerical simulation of the low-temperature photooxidation of hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde pollutants as well as the formation of ozone in humid air. The mechanism consists of 7 and 4 photochemical reactions initiated by UV radiation at wavelengths of 184.95 and 253.65 nm, respectively, and 62 reversible individual chemical reactions involving 32 chemical species (radicals, atoms, and molecules). The obtained results of numerical simulation are in good agreement with experimental data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "N. N.
