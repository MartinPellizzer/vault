The reason for this effectiveness was also investigated in detail by computer simulations in the wide range of the rate constant of OH radical reacting with TOC (kTOC). The laboratory-scale experiments revealed that the amount of TOC decomposed (delta TOC) increased by up to 41% by the two-port injection method, indicating a 27% improvement in delta O3/delta TOC. A detailed investigation of these experimental results by computer simulations showed that by injecting ozone in two ports the amount of ozone consumed for the OH radical formation was increased more remarkably than that of ozone consumed for the radical chain reactions, and that the amount of OH radical reacting with TOC was increased more strikingly than that with ozone. Furthermore, it was found that the smaller the kTOC value with 10(5)-10(9) M-1s-1 was, the more advantageous for the reaction efficiency the two-port injection method was."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced R&D Technology Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 8-1-1, Tsukaguchi-Honmachi, Amagasaki, Hyogo 661, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yasunaga", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furukawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawaai", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirotsuji", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xenobiotics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Xenobiotics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11380181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
