These factors could lighten damage in cell and elevate the level of glutashione(GSH), which depended upon phosphorylation modulation by protein kinases and gene transcription. A low level of bcl-2 gene expression could be detected in BEC at basic state, and either VIP or EGF stimulated the transcription of bcl-2, which improved the capability of BEC to resist oxidant injury. Otherwise, EGF and heat stress increased VIP autocrine from BEC and upregulated the expression of VIP receptor on BEC, so that the protective effect of VIP can be amplified in local sites. This study confirmed that there is an anti-injury protection on airway epithelium and the protection can be adaptively modulated by the regulatory peptides in local microenvironment and exogenous stimulus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410078."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "X Q", "Initials": "XQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Li Ke Xue Jin Zhan", "NlmUniqueID": "20730140R", "ISSNLinking": "0559-7765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "37221-79-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "62229-50-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Epidermal Growth Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytoprotection"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epidermal Growth Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12532805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
