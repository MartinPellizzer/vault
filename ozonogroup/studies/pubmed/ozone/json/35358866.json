However, the combined impacts of air warming and O<sub>3</sub> on phenology and its functional traits of urban trees are still poorly understood. Here, an experiment was performed to explore the variations of the spring phenological and functional traits in leaves of Populus alba 'Berolinensis' and Forsythia suspensa under ambient air (15.8\u00a0\u00b0C, 35.7\u00a0ppb), increased air temperature (IT, ambient air temperature\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C, 17.9\u00a0\u00b0C), elevated O<sub>3</sub> (EO, ambient air O<sub>3</sub> concentrations\u00a0+\u00a040\u00a0ppb, 77.4\u00a0ppb), and their combined treatments (17.7\u00a0\u00b0C, 74.5\u00a0ppb). Our results showed that: IT advanced the beginning of leaf bud expansion phase of P. alba 'Berolinensis' and F. suspensa for 6\u00a0d and 5\u00a0d, respectively, increased leaf unfolding rate, leaf area and dry weight, and enhanced photosynthesis and antioxidative enzyme activities. EO delayed the beginning of leaf bud expansion phase of P. alba 'Berolinensis' for 5\u00a0d, decreased leaf area and biomass, and inhibited photosynthesis and caused oxidative damage of plant leaves. Compared to EO, the combined treatment advanced the spring phenophase, increased growth and induced the higher level of photosynthetic rate and antioxidative enzymes activities in plant leaves, which indicated that the positive effects of increased temperature (17.7\u00a0\u00b0C) alleviated the inhibition of growth and photosynthesis induced by ozone. Our findings can provide a theoretical reference for predicting the adaptation of functional traits of the two trees blossomed early under warming and O<sub>3</sub> pollution at spring phenological stage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
