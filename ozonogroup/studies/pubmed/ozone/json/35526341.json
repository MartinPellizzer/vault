Herein, MgO/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> was prepared for catalytic ozonation of ammonia in an aqueous solution. The influence of various reaction conditions was systematically investigated and optimized, in which the reaction kinetics was also analyzed. After doping Ce, the catalyst with Mg-Co-Ce molar ratio of 4:1:1 and calcined at 700\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h, has abundant surface oxygen vacancies and exhibited excellent performance for the selective catalytic oxidation of ammonia to gaseous nitrogen by ozone. It was found that the catalytic activity of catalysts was positively related to oxygen vacancies concentration on the composites surface, which might play a vital role in selective catalytic ozonation. Under the optimal conditions, the ammonia removal rate in MgO/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> catalytic system was 0.03328\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99942), about 2.1 times greater than that of MgO/Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (0.01597\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99813), and the selectivity was further enhanced from 73.57% to 86.94%. Moreover, the evolution of nitrogen and chlorine species was determined to discuss the mechanism of selective oxidation of ammonia in the low chlorine-containing solution. This study might promote the understanding of catalytic ozonation of ammonia to gaseous nitrogen selectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
