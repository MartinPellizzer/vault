Herein, Ca, Pb, As, and NO/SO<sub>2</sub> were selected as a typical alkaline-earth metal, heavy metal, metalloid, and acid gas, respectively, to evaluate their interferences on catalytic behaviors and surface properties of an optimized urchin-like CuMn catalyst. Ca/Pb loading weakens the formation of oxygen vacancies, oxygen mobility, and acidity due to the fusion of Mn-Ca/Pb-O, leading to their inferior catalytic performance with poor CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity and mineralization rate. Noticeably, the presence of As induces excessively strong acidity, facilitating the inevitable formation of byproducts. Catalytic co-ozonation of NO/DCM is achieved with stoichiometric ozone addition. Unfortunately, SO<sub>2</sub> introduction brings irreversible deactivation due to strong competition adsorption and the loss of active sites. Unexpectedly, Ca loading protects active sites from an attack by SO<sub>2</sub>. The formation of unstable sulfites and the released Mn-O structure offset the negative effect from SO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the catalytic ozonation of DCM exhibits a distinctive priority in the antipoisoning of metals with the maintenance of DCM conversion. The construction of more stable acid sites should be the future direction of catalyst design; otherwise, catalytic ozonation should be arranged together with post heavy metal capture and a deacidification system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Lab of Biomass/Wastes Utilization, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, P.R.
