Ambient air pollution is one potential contributor to vision impairments, but few epidemiological studies have demonstrated such an association. This cross-sectional survey collected the information of 33,626 subjects aged \u226550 years in six developing countries during 2007-2010. Myopia was identified based on questions related to symptoms of myopia. The annual concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were estimated with the satellite data and chemical transport model. We examined the associations between the two pollutants and myopia using mixed-effect Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation (sandwich estimation). We observed J-shaped associations between the two pollutants and myopia, and identified 12 and 54\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> as the threshold concentrations. The adjusted prevalence ratio was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.38) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations above their threshold, respectively. In addition, the interaction analysis suggested a synergistic interaction of these two pollutants on myopia in the additive model, with a synergistic index of 1.81 (Bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.92, 4.94). Our results indicate that long-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> might be important environmental risk factors of myopia in the elderly, and suggest that more efforts should be taken to reduce airborne PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> levels to protect vision health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
