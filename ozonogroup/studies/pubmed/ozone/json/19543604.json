Characterisation of the soots using elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, solvent extraction, thermal desorption and electron microscopy techniques before and after reaction with ozone allows assessment of the reactivity of soots from these different fuels. Despite the production of toluene and kerosene soots from identical combustion conditions, strong differences in structure and reactivity are observed in terms of their reaction with ozone. However, toluene soot is a much better mimic of diesel soot. It is proposed that the differing reactivities of the soots is related to the nature of the organic carbon and structure of the elemental carbon which vary with soots from the different fuels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UKM13 9PL."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daly", "ForeName": "Helen M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horn", "ForeName": "Andrew B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19543604", "10.1039/b815400g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
