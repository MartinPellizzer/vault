For the first time, this region as one of the busiest seas and most important international shipping lane in the world with significant nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) emissions has been analyzed comprehensively. This paper aims to characterize and quantify the contribution of maritime transport sector emissions to NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the Red Sea using local Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Maritime traffic volume was estimated using SaudiSat satellite-based Automatic Identification System (S-AIS) data, and the remotely measured tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations data was acquired from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite. A significant spatial variation in the NO<sub>2</sub> values was detected across the Red Sea, with values ranging from 4.03\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>14</sup> to 41.39\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>14</sup>\u202fmolecules/cm<sup>2</sup>. Most notably, the NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in international waters were more than double those in the western coastal regions, whereas the concentrations close to seaports were 100% higher than those over international waters. The results indicated that the local GWR model performed significantly better than the global ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. The GWR model had a strong and significant overall coefficient of determination with an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.94 (p\u202f<\u202f0.005) in comparison to the OLS model with an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.45 (p\u202f<\u202f0.005). Maritime traffic volume and proximity to seaports weighted by shipping activities explained about 94% of the variations of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the Red Sea. The results of this study suggest that the S-AIS data and environmental satellite measurements can be used to assess the impacts of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from shipping emissions. These findings should stimulate further research into using additional covariates to explain the NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in areas near seaports where the standardized residuals are high."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
