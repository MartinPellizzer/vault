In this study, HVACP was applied to treat pure aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) powder on a glass slide. AFB<sub>1</sub> was degraded by 76% using a 5 min HVACP treatment in air having 40% relative humidity. The degradation products of AFB<sub>1</sub> were separated, and their molecular formulas were elucidated using liquid-chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS). Six main degradation products were observed. The structures of the degradation products were further clarified via orbitrap mass spectrometry by means of fragmentation of the parental ions. Two degradation pathways were proposed on the basis of the structure of the degradation products. Among the six degradation products, two were ozonolysis products of AFB<sub>1</sub>. The appearance of the other four degradation products indicates that AFB<sub>1</sub> was degraded by other reactive species besides ozone that were generated during HVACP treatment. Reactive oxygen gas species are suggested as the major agents for aflatoxin degradation during HVACP treatment. Two degradation pathways of AFB<sub>1</sub> by HVACP treatment were proposed. One pathway involves reactions in which H<sup>\u2022</sup>, OH<sup>\u2022</sup>, CHO<sup>\u2022</sup> radicals are added. The other involves epoxidation by HO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022</sup> radicals and oxidation of AFB<sub>1</sub>by the combined effects of the oxidative species OH<sup>\u2022</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>. According to the structure-bioactivity relationship of AFB<sub>1</sub>, the bioactivity of the AFB<sub>1</sub> samples subjected to HVACP treatment is significantly reduced because of the disappearance of the C8\u2550C9 double bond in the furofuran ring in all of the major degradation products as well as the modification of the lactone ring, cyclopentanone, and the methoxyl group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5577-931X"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cooper", "ForeName": "Bruce", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stroshine", "ForeName": "Richard L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7377-9671"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ileleji", "ForeName": "Klein E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Iowa State University , Ames, Iowa 50011-1061, United States."}], "LastName": "Keener", "ForeName": "Kevin M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28643515", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01604"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
