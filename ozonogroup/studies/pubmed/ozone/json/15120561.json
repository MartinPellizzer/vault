The extent of preozonation may be monitored by determining the characteristic ozonation behaviors of preozonized phenolic solutions, such as residual phenolic concentration, ADMI value and ozone gas outlet concentration. Experimental results showed that as the initial phenolic compounds decomposed completely, the ozone gas outlet concentration rapidly increases. In addition, at pH 7, a peak ADMI value appears during the preozonation of 4-cresol and 2-chlorophenol, while for 4-nitrophenol the ADMI value decreases monotonically. Based on the characteristic ozonation behaviors and the ozone utilization rate, three characteristic times were chosen in order to have better control on the extent of preozonation. The effect of preozonation on the biodegradability of preozonized phenolic solution was studied based on these characteristic times. The intermediate products during the preozonation were also identified. The variation of BOD5 is strongly dependent on the accumulation of intermediate products. It is suggested that the best characteristic time is as the rapid increase of ozone gas outlet concentration in this study. The biodegradability (BOD5/COD) of preozonized 4-cresol, 2-chlorophenol and 4-nitrophenol solutions increase to 0.18, 0.26 and 0.33, respectively, for the best characteristic time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, No. 43, Sec. 4, Keelung Road, Taipei 106, Taiwan. hsu@ch.ntust.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "Yung-Chien", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hsiang-Cheng", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jyh-Herng", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15120561", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.02.011", "S0045-6535(04)00125-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
