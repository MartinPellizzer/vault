However, to date it is unclear how extreme precipitation and nitrogen (N) input will affect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in temperate desert steppe ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted an in-situ in a temperate desert steppe in the northwest of Inner Mongolia, China between 2018 and 2021, in which N inputs were combined with natural extreme precipitation events, with the aim of better understanding the mechanism of any interactive effects on N<sub>2</sub>O emission. The study result showed that N<sub>2</sub>O emission in this desert steppe was relatively small and did not show significant seasonal change. The annual N<sub>2</sub>O emission increased in a non-linear trend with increasing N input, with a much greater effect of N input in a wet year (2019) than in a dry year (2021). This was mainly due to the fact that the boost effect of high N input (on June 17<sup>th</sup> 2019) on N<sub>2</sub>O emission was greatly amplified by nearly 17-46 times by an extreme precipitation event on June 24<sup>th</sup> 2019. In contrast, this greatly promoting effect of high N input on N<sub>2</sub>O emission was not observed on September 26<sup>th</sup> 2019 by a similar extreme precipitation event. Further analysis showed that soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N content and the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (amoA (AOB)) were the most critical factors affecting N<sub>2</sub>O emission. Soil moisture played an important indirect role in regulating N<sub>2</sub>O emission, mainly by influencing the abundance of amoA (AOB) and de-nitrification functional microorganisms (nosZ gene). In conclusion, the effect of extreme precipitation events on N<sub>2</sub>O emission was greatly increased by high N input. Furthermore, in this desert steppe, annual N<sub>2</sub>O flux is co-managed through soil nitrification substrate concentration (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N), the abundance of soil N transformation functional microorganisms and soil moisture. Overall, it was worth noting that an increase in extreme precipitation coupled with increasing N input may significantly increase future N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from desert steppes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
