The increase in urbanization and air pollution has led to changes in the distribution, type, and concentration of the atmospheric constituents, affecting spectral atmospheric transmission and modifying weather and climate. This requires knowledge of the real optical properties of atmospheric transmission. We have developed a model for the radiative properties of atmospheric transmission, with ground-based multispectral measurements of direct solar radiation in the 310-830-nm range. An application of this model to Athens' urban atmosphere is described. The radiative properties of a U.S. Standard Atmosphere are also simulated by use of the LOWTRAN 7 code; simulations and calculations are compared. The total ozone retrieval scheme and the algorithm for retrieving the spectral transmission function and optical thickness, considering multiple scattering, are given. Results for the spectral atmospheric transmission and aerosol and gas transmission functions as well as optical-thickness measurements for the Athens area are also presented as an application of the proposed methodology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Research Team, Institute of Meteorology and Physics of the Atmospheric Environment, P.O.
