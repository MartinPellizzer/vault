WHO guidelines recommend an 8 hour mean value of < or = 60 ppb ozone without health risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate if elevated zone concentrations at moderate altitudes in the Austrian Alps, characteristic of the situation in the summer months, influence pulmonary function after physical exercise. 24 male non-smokers (mean age 26.7 +/- 4 years) were investigated in the Tyrol (Pitztal) at a mean sea level of 2434 m. During a mountain-guide course lasting for 6 days the subjects were physically active all day long. Spirometry was performed in the morning and in the evening after 8 h of exercise. Ozone and PM10 concentrations were measured on site. The ozone 24 hour mean values ranged between 53 and 71 ppb. A mean decrease of 5.3% (p < 0.00001) was measured in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) at t3,m in immediately after the highest ozone 24 hour mean value had been registered (71 ppb). A clinically relevant decrease of FVC and FEV1 > 10% was observed at t3,m in 35% of the subjects. However, a linear dependence of lung function changes on the ozone 8 hour mean values was demonstrable for all measuring points only in 10% of these subjects. In 90% of the subjects with a decrease of lung function parameters > 10%, this reduction was at least not monocausally linked to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Spezialabteilung f\u00fcr Leistungsmedizin und Wehrergonomie, Heeresspital, Wien."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wittels", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neuberger", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hauck", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanduth", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Reduktion von Lungenfunktionsparametern nach k\u00f6rperlicher Belastung in den \u00f6sterreichischen Alpen bei Ozonkonzentrationen unterhalb der gesetzlichen Vorwarnstufe."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Wien Klin Wochenschr", "NlmUniqueID": "21620870R", "ISSNLinking": "0043-5325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Austria"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximum Allowable Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mountaineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9265390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
