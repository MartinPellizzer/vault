A statistical test has been used to the ozone air concentrations measured in the French rural monitoring network stations, called MERA, in order to bring out spatio-temporal trends in air quality in France over the 1995-2003 period. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been developed for detecting and estimating monotonic trends in the time series and applied in our study at annual values: mean, 98th percentile and median based on hourly averaged ozone concentrations and applied to daily maxima. In France, when averaged overall 9 stations between 1995 and 2003, a slight increasing trend of the O(3) levels (+0.6 +/- 1.3% year( - 1)) is observed, which is strongly influenced by the concentrations of the high altitude stations. In stations below 1000 m a mean rate of -0.48% year( - 1) from annual average concentrations, of -0.45% year( - 1) for medians and of +0.56% year( - 1) for P.98 over the 1995-2003 period were obtained. In stations above 1,000 m a mean rate of +1.75% year( - 1) from annual averages values, of +4.05% year( - 1) for medians and of +2.55% year( - 1) for P.98 were calculated over the 1997-2003 period. This situation is comparable to the one observed in other countries. In Europe and in France a reduction of precursor emissions is observed whereas a slight increasing trend of the O(3) levels is observed over the 1995-2003 period. One reason is the non-linearity of chemical ozone production with respect to precursor emissions. Possible explanations are an increase in near-surface ozone values caused by a reduced ozone titration by reduced NO( x ), the meteorological parameters change, an increase in bio-geogenic compound concentrations, the intercontinental transport from North America and Asia and the influence of stratospheric-tropospheric exchanges. These possible explanations must be interpreted carefully as on the short time scales considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "D\u00e9partement Chimie et Environnement, Ecole des Mines de Douai, 941 rue Charles Bourseul, BP 838, 59508 Douai, France. pierresicard25@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sicard", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coddeville", "ForeName": "Patrice", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Galloo", "ForeName": "Jean-Claude", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 1999 Aug;160(2):390-6", "ArticleIdList": ["10430703"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2002;117(2):215-24", "ArticleIdList": ["11916036"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Monit. 2004 Jan;6(1):1-11", "ArticleIdList": ["14737461"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2004 Nov;57(8):931-42", "ArticleIdList": ["15488583"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18665450", "10.1007/s10661-008-0470-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
