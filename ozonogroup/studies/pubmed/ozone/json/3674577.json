Ten healthy and 10 asthmatic subjects inhaled via a mouth-piece 0.12 or 0.18 ppm of ozone (O3) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or clean air for 30 min at rest followed by 10 min during moderate exercise (32.5 L/min) on a treadmill. The following pulmonary functional values were measured before and after exposure: peak flow, total respiratory resistance (RT), maximal flow at 50 and 75% of expired VC, and FEV1. After exercise exposure to 0.18 ppm O3, statistically significant increases were seen in RT in asthmatic and healthy adolescent subjects. No consistent changes were seen in either group after NO2 exposure. Also, no significant differences in response to oxidant pollutants between the 2 groups could be demonstrated. It was concluded that neither group was consistently sensitive to these pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, University of Washington, Seattle 98195."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koenig", "ForeName": "J Q", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Covert", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Belle", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierson", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Rev Respir Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "0370523", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0805"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3674577", "10.1164/ajrccm/136.5.1152"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
