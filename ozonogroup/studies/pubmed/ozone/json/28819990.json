Maternal inactivity and calorically rich diets lead to offspring that show signs of obesity. Exacerbated O<sub>3</sub> susceptibility of offspring could thus be manifested by maternal obesity. Thirty-day-old female Long-Evans rats were fed a control (CD) or high-fat (HF) (60% calories) diet for 6 wks and then bred. GD1 rats were then housed with a running wheel (RW) or without a wheel (SED) until parturition, creating four groups of offspring: CD-SED, CD-RW, HF-SED and HF-RW. HF diet was terminated at PND 35 and all offspring were placed on CD. Body weight and %fat of dams were greatest in order; HF-SED\u2009>\u2009HF-RW\u2009>\u2009CD-SED\u2009>\u2009CD-RW. Adult offspring were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> for two consecutive days (0.8\u2009ppm, 4\u2009h/day). Glucose tolerance tests (GTT), ventilatory parameters (plethysmography), and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) cell counts and protein biomarkers were performed to assess response to O<sub>3</sub>. Exercise and diet altered body weight and %fat of young offspring. GTT, ventilation and BALF cell counts were exacerbated by O<sub>3</sub> with responses markedly exacerbated in males. HF diet and O<sub>3</sub> led to significant exacerbation of several BALF parameters: total cell count, neutrophils and lymphocytes were increased in male HF-SED versus CD-SED. Males were hyperglycemic after O<sub>3</sub> exposure and exhibited exacerbated GTT responses. Ventilatory dysfunction was also exacerbated in males. Maternal exercise had minimal effects on O<sub>3</sub> response. The results of this exploratory study suggest a link between maternal obesity and susceptibility to O<sub>3</sub> in their adult offspring in a sex-specific manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnstone", "ForeName": "A F M", "Initials": "AFM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmid", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schladweiler", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1812-8582"], "LastName": "Snow", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "U P", "Initials": "UP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Long-Evans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sedentary Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Characteristics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28819990", "10.1080/08958378.2017.1342719"]}}]}
