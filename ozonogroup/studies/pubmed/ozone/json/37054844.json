Natural gas alone and natural gas-hydrogen blends are burned in identical gas stoves, and the emitted CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub> are measured. The base case with natural gas only is compared with the natural gas and hydrogen blends (including hydrogen additions of 10%, 20% and 30% volumetrically). The experimental results show that the combustion efficiency increases from 39.32% to 44.4% by enhancing the hydrogen blending ratio from 0 to 0.3. While CO<sub>2</sub> and CO emissions are reduced with rising the hydrogen ratio in the blend, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions have a fluctuating trend. Moreover, a life cycle analysis is performed to determine the environmental impact of the considered blending scenarios. With the blending ratio of 0.3 hydrogen by volume, global warming potential decreases from 6.233 to 6.123\u00a0kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per kg blend, and acidification potential reduces from 0.0507 to 0.04928\u00a0kg SO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per kg blend in comparison with natural gas. On the other hand, human toxicity, abiotic depletion, and ozone depletion potentials per kg blend show slight augmentation from 5.30 to 5.52\u00a0kg 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB) eq., 0.0000107 to 0.00005921\u00a0kg SB eq., and 3.17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-8</sup> to 5.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-8</sup>\u00a0kg CFC-11 eq., respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
