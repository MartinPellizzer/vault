Chemoselectivity for these azide to alkene diazo group transfers (DGT) is typically disfavored, thus limiting their synthetic utility. Herein, this work discloses a palladium-catalyzed intramolecular azide to alkene DGT, which grants chemoselectivity over competing aziridination. The data support a catalytic cycloreversion mechanism distinct from other known metal-catalyzed azide/alkene reactions: nitrenoid/metalloradical and (3+2) cycloadditions. Kinetics experiments reveal an unusual mechanistic profile in which the catalyst is not operative during the rate-controlling step, rather, it is active during the product-determining step. Catalytic DGT was used to synthesize N-heterocyclic quinazolinones, a medicinally relevant structural core. We also report on the competing aziridination and subsequent ring expansion to another N-heterocyclic core structure of interest, benzodiazepinones."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
