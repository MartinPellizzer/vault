However, the extremely complex compositions of organics in SGFW are still unknown and their transformation pathways in O<sub>3</sub>- and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH-dominated systems are not well recognized, which restrain the selection of treatment technology and optimization of operational parameters. The removal characteristics and reaction mechanism of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in SGFW treated by ozonation and Fenton processes were comparatively investigated using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The results showed that both processes could degrade low-oxygen highly unsaturated and phenolic organics, polyphenolics and polycyclic aromatics, and transform them into aliphatic organics and high-oxygen highly unsaturated and phenolic organics. With increasing action of reactive oxygen species (O<sub>3</sub> for ozonation and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH for Fenton process), the degradation products (mainly aliphatic organics) increased during ozonation. However, in Fenton process, a wider range of DOM was removed without aliphatic organics accumulation. The degradation mechanisms of DOM during ozonation and Fenton processes included oxygen addition reactions (+3O, +H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and +2O) as dominant pathways. However, ozonation showed more violent oxygenation, hydroxylation, and carboxylation, while Fenton process presented more violent chain-breaking reactions. These results revealed the selective oxidation of ozone and nonselective oxidation of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH during SGFW treatment, and provided theoretical support for selecting SGFW treatment approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
