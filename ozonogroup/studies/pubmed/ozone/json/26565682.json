The reliability of the analytical methods was also tested. The applied methods of analysis were found to be suitable based on linearity, trueness, repeatability, selectivity and limit of quantification all the pesticides tested. All tap and ozonated water wash cycles removed a significant quantity of the pesticides from the olives, with a few exceptions. Generally, extending the wash time increased the pesticide reduction with ozonated water, but did not make significant differences with tap water. During olive oil processing, depending on the processing technique and physicochemical properties of the pesticides, eight of nine pesticides were concentrated into olive oil (processing factor >\u00a01) with almost no significant difference between treatments. Imidacloprid did not pass into olive oil. Ozonated water wash for 5\u00a0min reduced chlorpyrifos, \u03b2-cyfluthrin, \u03b1-cypermethrin and imidacloprid contents by 38%, 50%, 55% and 61% respectively in olives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Food Reference Laboratory , Residue Department, FSM Bulvari , Ankara , Turkey."}], "LastName": "K\u0131r\u0131\u015f", "ForeName": "Sevilay", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Ankara University , Faculty of Engineering, Department of Food Engineering , Ankara , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Velioglu", "ForeName": "Yakup Sedat", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Olive Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Olea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Olive Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26565682", "10.1080/19440049.2015.1114683"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
