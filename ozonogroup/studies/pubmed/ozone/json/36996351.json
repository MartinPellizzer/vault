Important data gaps exist regarding the structures, reaction mechanisms, and environmental occurrence of TPs from 6PPD ozonation. To address these data gaps, gas-phase ozonation of 6PPD was conducted over 24-168 h and ozonation TPs were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The probable structures were proposed for 23 TPs with 5 subsequently standard-verified. Consistent with prior findings, 6PPDQ (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was one of the major TPs in 6PPD ozonation (\u223c1 to 19% yield). Notably, 6PPDQ was not observed during ozonation of 6QDI (<i>N</i>-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-<i>N</i>'-phenyl-<i>p</i>-quinonediimine), indicating that 6PPDQ formation does not proceed through 6QDI or associated 6QDI TPs. Other major 6PPD TPs included multiple C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> isomers, with presumptive <i>N</i>-oxide, <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>'-dioxide, and orthoquinone structures. Standard-verified TPs were quantified in roadway-impacted environmental samples, with total concentrations of 130 \u00b1 3.2 \u03bcg/g in methanol extracts of tire tread wear particles (TWPs), 34 \u00b1 4 \u03bcg/g-TWP in aqueous TWP leachates, 2700 \u00b1 1500 ng/L in roadway runoff, and 1900 \u00b1 1200 ng/L in roadway-impacted creeks. These data demonstrate that 6PPD TPs are likely an important and ubiquitous class of contaminants in roadway-impacted environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3908-630X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Haoqi Nina", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8107-5968"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Ximin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7491-7028"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Zhenyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "Melissa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}], "LastName": "Rideout", "ForeName": "Craig A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7379-265X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}], "LastName": "Peter", "ForeName": "Katherine T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}], "LastName": "Dodd", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7968-4198"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Urban Waters, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington 98421, United States."}], "LastName": "Kolodziej", "ForeName": "Edward P", "Initials": "EP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-04-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Rubber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HJD0U67PS1", "NameOfSubstance": "N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylenediamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rubber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylenediamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36996351", "10.1021/acs.est.2c08690"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
