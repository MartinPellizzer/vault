Karst] were exposed to ozone during the summers of three consecutive years and the fatty acid composition of the chloroplast membrane lipid, monogalactosyl diglyceride (MCDG) was analysed over the last 14 months. Significant variations in the degree of unsaturation and the percentage of linolenic acid (18:3) were not found, either on a seasonal basis or in relation to ozone treatment. The proportion of octadecatetraenoic acid (18:4) and other \u0394<sup>5</sup> fatty acids increased during autumn in trees grown in filtered air, but this seasonal effect was less pronounced in ozone-treated trees. The ratio of two forms of linoleate, <sup>\u03945,9</sup> 18:2 and <sup>\u03949,12</sup> 18:2 also increased significantly during the frost hardening period but not in trees previously exposed to ozone. This implies that two separate biosynthetic pathways exist, one for the \u0394<sup>12</sup> and one for the \u0394<sup>12</sup> desaturated series, which operate at different relative rates, depending on environmental conditions. It is suggested that ozone may interfere with the biosynthesis of 18:4 during frost hardening by inhibiting the \u0394<sup>5</sup> desaturation of oleate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Sciences, Institute of Environmental & Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LAI 4YQ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolfenden", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Sciences, Institute of Environmental & Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LAI 4YQ."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wellburn", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Alberdi, M., Fernandez, J., Cristi, R., Romero, M. & Rios, D.
