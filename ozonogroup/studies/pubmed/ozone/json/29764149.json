Tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation was generated at the Advanced Light Source. OH radicals were generated from the reaction of O(<sup>1</sup>D) + H<sub>2</sub>O in a flow reactor in He at 8 Torr. The initial O(<sup>1</sup>D) concentration, where the atom was formed by pulsed laser photolysis of ozone, was determined from the measured depletion of a known concentration of ozone. Concentrations of OH and O(<sup>3</sup>P) were obtained by fitting observed time traces with a kinetics model constructed with literature rate coefficients. The absolute cross section of OH was determined to be \u03c3(13.436 eV) = 3.2 \u00b1 1.0 Mb and \u03c3(14.193 eV) = 4.7 \u00b1 1.6 Mb relative to the known cross section for O(<sup>3</sup>P) at 14.193 eV. The absolute photoionization spectrum was obtained by recording a spectrum at a resolution of 8 meV (50 meV steps) and scaling to the single-energy cross sections. We computed the absolute VUV photoionization spectrum of OH and O(<sup>3</sup>P) using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster Dyson orbitals and a Coulomb photoelectron wave function and found good agreement with the observed absolute photoionization spectra."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA."}], "Identifier": ["000000015960056X"], "LastName": "Dodson", "ForeName": "Leah G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California 94551, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savee", "ForeName": "John D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000264292853"], "LastName": "Gozem", "ForeName": "Samer", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Linhan", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000167885016"], "LastName": "Krylov", "ForeName": "Anna I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California 94551, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000292710282"], "LastName": "Taatjes", "ForeName": "Craig A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California 94551, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000343048218"], "LastName": "Osborn", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000168741137"], "LastName": "Okumura", "ForeName": "Mitchio", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29764149", "10.1063/1.5024249"]}}]}
