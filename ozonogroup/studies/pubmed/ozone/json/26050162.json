The captured fish were washed, placed in plastic boxes, covered with flake ice and refrigerated at 2\u00b0C for up to 2-weeks onboard and, thereafter, for 11 days onshore. The experiments employed sterile, filtered and ozonated water at a concentration of 2ppm for washing the fish and making the flake ice. The results are compared with samples from a traditional treatment consisting of water and flake ice of marine origin. Fish were caught in four different hauls, which took 14, 12, 8 and 3 days in being landed. Subsequently, fish were stored for 1, 5, 7 and 11 days at 3\u00b0C. The different treatments were evaluated using sensory, microbiological and chemical techniques. Fish treated with ozone always showed the best quality. Megrim treated with ozone was still suitable for consumption after 14 days on board, and megrim stored for 12, 8 and 3 days on board could be stored for a further five days in the ice state once landed with an acceptable quality. In contrast, control fish were not suitable for consumption if stored for longer than three days on board.The results indicate that treatment with water and ice flakes made from sterile and ozonated water maintains the quality of fresh megrim onboard fishing boats and upon arrival onshore."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
