Fundamental information on how the virus interacts with inanimate surfaces commonly found in our daily life and when in contact with the skin will be helpful in developing strategies to inhibit the spread of the virus. Here in, a critically important review of current understanding of the interaction between virus and surface is summarized from chemistry point-of-view. The Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek and extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theories to model virus attachments on surfaces are introduced, along with the interaction type and strength, and quantification of each component. The virus survival and transfer are affected by a combination of biological, physical, and chemical parameters, as well as environmental parameters. The surface properties for virus and virus survival on typical surfaces such as metals, plastics, and glass are summarized. Attention is also paid to the transfer of virus to/from surfaces and skin. Typical virus disinfection strategies utilizing heat, light, chemicals, and ozone are discussed together with their disinfection mechanism. In the last section, design principles for virus repelling surface chemistry such as surperhydrophobic or surperhydrophilic surfaces are also introduced, to demonstrate how the integration of surface property control and advanced material fabrication can lead to the development of functional surfaces for mitigating the effect of viral infection upon contact."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
