Further, based on the observation data of meteorological elements, conventional pollutants, and volatile organic compounds \uff08VOCs\uff09 concentrations at an urban site in Yinchuan from May to July, the difference in meteorological elements and precursor concentrations between the polluted days and the non-polluted days were compared. Then, the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity and the VOCs sources were discussed using the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling \uff08F0AM\uff09 and positive matrix factorization \uff08PMF\uff09 model, respectively. The results showed that\uff1a \u2460 The O<sub>3</sub> pollution occurred from May to July in 2022, and the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>-8h<sub>-90per</sub> were 156 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, 170 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and 174 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, with exceeding standard rates of 9.7%, 26.7%, and 29.0%, respectively. \u2461 Compared with those on the non-polluted days, the hourly mean values of temperature, total solar radiation, and concentrations of various precursors on the O<sub>3</sub>-polluted days increased, including the volume concentrations of propane, isobutane, ethane, <i>n</i>-butane, and dichloromethane, which increased significantly by 33.1%, 29.1%, 25.0%, 22.7%, and 21.3%, respectively. The results showed that the combined increase in pollutant emissions and adverse meteorological conditions contributed to the formation of O<sub>3</sub>. \u2462 From May to July 2022, the top five VOCs species in terms of ozone formation potential \uff08OFP\uff09 value on whole, non-polluted, and polluted days were the same. They were acetaldehyde, <i>m</i>/<i>p</i>-xylene, ethylene, isoprene, and toluene, mainly from solvent use sources, natural sources, and chemical industry emissions. \u2463 The local O<sub>3</sub> production was mostly controlled by VOCs, and the relative incremental reactivity \uff08RIR\uff09 results revealed that O<sub>3</sub> production showed strong positive sensitivity to alkene and aromatic hydrocarbon but showed negative sensitivity to NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> on both polluted and non-polluted days. The relative contributions of active species such as acetone, ethylene, and isobutane to O<sub>3</sub> production were high, and the implementation of an emission reduction scheme with the ratio of VOCs to NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emission reduction much greater than 1 could effectively reduce the local O<sub>3</sub> concentration. \u2464 The main sources of atmospheric VOCs in Yinchuan were motor vehicle emission sources \uff0832.3%\uff09, process sources \uff0820.7%\uff09, combustion sources \uff0819.2%\uff09, solvent use sources \uff0812.7%\uff09, gasoline volatile sources \uff089.1%\uff09, and natural sources \uff086%\uff09, and the contribution rate of motor vehicle emission sources on polluted days increased by 4.6% compared with that on non-polluted days, indicating that the motor vehicle emission source was an important object of summer VOCs control in Yinchuan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yinchuan Ecological Environment Monitoring Centre, Yinchuan 750001, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Rong", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yinchuan Ecological Environment Monitoring Centre, Yinchuan 750001, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xue-Zhe", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Zhongkelanyi Information Technology Co., Ltd., Hefei 230000, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Chen-Bing", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Zhongkelanyi Information Technology Co., Ltd., Hefei 230000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39168662", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202308052"]}}]}
