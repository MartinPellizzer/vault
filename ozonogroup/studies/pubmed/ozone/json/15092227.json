This study was conducted over two growing seasons (1987, 1988) at Virginia State University, Randolph Research Farm, Petersburg, Virginia. Two populations were obtained by crossing insensitive plant introductions with sensitive commercial cultivars. Ratings on the scale of 1 to 5 (1 = 0 to 20% leaf injury, 2 = 21 to 40%, 3 = 41 to 60%, 4 = 61 to 80%, and 5 > 80%) were made on 160 F(2), F(3) progenies, and parental lines. Population mean injury ratings were recorded and estimates of genotypic, environmental, and phenotypic variances were computed. Estimates of heritability in the broadsense and of genetic advance were calculated for each population using F(2) and family component variance methods. Population means of the F(2) and F(3) progenies were not significantly different from their mid-parent values, suggesting that genetic variance was primarily additive. Broad-sense heritability estimates using F(2) variance method ranged from 51.4 to 70.5% and using family component variance method ranged from 62.1 to 75.6%. In this study, the computed genetic advance values closely parallel those of heritability estimated values. The high heritable nature of insensitivity would indicate that effective levels of insensitivity could be transferred to agronomically superior cultivars in a relatively short time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Virginia State University, PO Box 318, Petersburg, VA 23803, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mebrahtu", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mersie", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rangappa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092227", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90173-a", "0269-7491(90)90173-A"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
