However, no previous clinical study has examined whether lead exposure is associated with significant effects on biomarkers of NO activity (plasma nitrites, nitrates, and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate; cGMP). We investigated whether there is an association between the circulating concentrations of nitrites, nitrates, and cGMP and the concentrations of lead in whole blood (B-Pb) or plasma (P-Pb) from 62 lead-exposed subjects (30 men and 32 women). P-Pb was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and B-Pb by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. Plasma cGMP concentrations were measured using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. We found a negative correlation between plasma nitrite and B-Pb concentrations (r = -0.358; P = 0.004), and between plasma nitrite and P-Pb concentrations (r = -0.264; P = 0.038), thus suggesting increased inhibition of NO formation with increasing B-Pb or P-Pb concentrations. However, no significant correlations were found between plasma nitrate or cGMP and B-Pb or P-Pb concentrations (all P > 0.05). These findings suggest a significant inhibitory effect of lead exposure on NO formation and provide clinical evidence for a biological mechanism possibly involved the association between lead exposure and increased cardiovascular risk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical, Toxicological and Food Science Analysis, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, Av. do Cafe, s/n, 14040-903 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbosa", "ForeName": "Fernando", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sertorio", "ForeName": "Jonas T C", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerlach", "ForeName": "Raquel F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanus-Santos", "ForeName": "Jose E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0417615", "ISSNLinking": "0340-5761"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H2D2X058MU", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic GMP"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic GMP"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16670857", "10.1007/s00204-006-0111-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
