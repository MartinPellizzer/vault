A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and an observation-based model (OBM) were combined for the first time to investigate the contributions of VOC sources and species to local photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation. The average VOC concentrations in 2014 and 2015 were (36.47\u00b133.44)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and (34.69\u00b134.08)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, respectively. The VOC sources identified by the PMF model for 2014 and 2015 belonged to 7 source categories, including vehicular emissions, liquefied petroleum gas usage, biogenic emissions, furniture manufacturing industry, chemical industry, chemical coating industry, and chemical materials industry emission sources. The OBM was modified to assess the O<sub>3</sub> precursors' relationships. Generally, photochemical O<sub>3</sub> production was VOC limited, with positive relative incremental reactivity (RIR) values for VOC species and a negative RIR value for NO. It can be seen that alkenes (1.20-1.79) and aromatics (1.42-1.48) presented higher RIR values and controlling O<sub>3</sub> would be the most effective when the VOC emissions from alkenes were reduced by 80%. Vehicle emissions (1.01-1.11), LPG (0.74-0.82), biogenic emissions (0.34-0.42), and furniture manufacturing industry (0.32-0.49) sources were the top four VOC sources making significant contributions to photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation, which suggests that controlling vehicle emissions, biogenic emissions, LPG, and furniture manufacturing industry sources should be the most effective strategy to reduce photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jun-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun-Xiu", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yuan-Zhe", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-da", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Jing-Shu", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964809", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201706216"]}}]}
