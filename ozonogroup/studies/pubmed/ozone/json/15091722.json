After 105 days of exposure, half the seedlings within each family were wounded but not inoculated and half were wounded and inoculated with the pitch canker fungus, Fusarium subglutinans, to which five families were relatively resistant. After an additional 50 days of ozone treatment, seedling growth and canker development were recorded. Cankers were significantly (sigma < or = 0.05) smaller among resistant compared to susceptible families, and were significantly larger among seedlings receiving the highest (2.5) compared to the ambient (NF) ozone treatment. The wound scars of non-inoculated seedlings were also significantly larger among seedlings receiving the 2.5 compared to the NF treatment, but these dimensions did not differ significantly with seedling family or resistance. The weights of needles and large roots were significantly smaller at the 2.5 compared to the 1.7 ozone treatment for inoculated but not for non-inoculated seedlings; this resulted in a significant interaction for ozone and inoculation effects. Among resistant families, root weights were significantly smaller for inoculated seedlings. Diameter growth and dry weights of needles were significantly smaller among inoculated compared to non-inoculated seedlings, but did not differ between NF and 2.5 ozone treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Alabama Agricultural Experimental Station, M.
