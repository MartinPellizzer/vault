AcEW (pH 2.6; oxidation reduction potential, 1140 mV; 30 ppm of available chlorine) and NaOCl solution (150 ppm of available chlorine) reduced viable aerobes in lettuce by 2 log CFU/g within 10 min. For lettuce washed in alkaline electrolyzed water (AIEW) for 1 min and then disinfected in AcEW for 1 min, viable aerobes were reduced by 2 log CFU/g. On the other hand, ozonated water containing 5 ppm of ozone reduced viable aerobes in lettuce 1.5 log CFU/g within 10 min. It was discovered that AcEW showed a higher disinfectant effect than did ozonated water significantly at P < 0.05. It was confirmed by swabbing test that AcEW, ozonated water, and NaOCI solution removed aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, molds, and yeasts on the surface of lettuce. Therefore, residual microorganisms after the decontamination of lettuce were either in the inside of the cellular tissue, such as the stomata, or making biofilm on the surface of lettuce. Biofilms were observed by a scanning electron microscope on the surface of the lettuce treated with AcEW. Moreover, it was shown that the spores of bacteria on the surface were not removed by any treatment in this study. However, it was also observed that the surface structure of lettuce was not damaged by any treatment in this study. Thus, the use of AcEW for decontamination of fresh lettuce was suggested to be an effective means of controlling microorganisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. koseki@bpe.agr.hokudai.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koseki", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isobe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Aerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11347995", "10.4315/0362-028x-64.5.652", "S0362-028X(22)01309-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
