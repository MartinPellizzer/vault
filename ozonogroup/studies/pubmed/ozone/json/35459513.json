Intercomparison of the surface ozone from CAMS and MERRA-2 reanalysis showed significant negative bias (CAMS minus MERRA-2, same below) at Tibetan Plateau of up to 80 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, and the average R<sup>2</sup> was about 0.6 across China. Evaluated with the ground observations from China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC), we found that CAMS and MERRA-2 reanalysis were capable of capturing the key patterns of monthly and diurnal variations of surface ozone over China except for the western region, and MERRA-2 overestimated the observations compared to CAMS. Vertically, the CAMS profiles overestimated the ozone-sonde from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Center (WOUDC) above 200 hPa with the magnitude reaching up to 150 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, while little bias was found between the reanalysis and observations below 200 hPa. Intercomparison drawn from the vertical distribution between CAMS and MERRA-2 reanalysis showed that the negative bias appeared throughout the troposphere over China, while the positive bias emerged in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) with high order of magnitude exceeding 100 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, indicating large uncertainties at higher altitudes. In summary, we concluded that CAMS reanalysis showed better agreement with the observations in contrast to MERRA-2, and the large discrepancy especially at higher altitudes between these two reanalysis datasets could not be ignored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
