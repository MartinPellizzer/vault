Then, this color loses intensity and turns to yellow. Color formation is favored when operating at initial pH<sub>0</sub>\u202f=\u202f12.0 and ozone flow-rate 4.2\u202fmg/min. A mechanism describing color formation was proposed, being the main pathway involved an initial paracetamol hydroxylation to yield 3-hydroxyacetaminophen followed by the formation of 2-amino-5-hydroxyacetofenone. Then, these compounds are degraded to colored oxidation by-products. A model describing color evolution was also proposed, considering first-order kinetics for both color formation and degradation. The corresponding kinetic constant values were determined to be k<sub>f</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.01 (1/min) and k<sub>d</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.03 pH\u202f-0.055 (1/min), respectively. A relationship between aromaticity loss and color changes during the reaction has been estimated considering the parameter \u03b1=k<sub>A</sub>/k<sub>f</sub>, being \u03b1\u202f=\u202f1.62 pH\u202f+\u202f3.5 and the first-order rate constant for aromaticity loss given by k<sub>A</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.0162 pH\u202f+\u202f0.035 (1/min)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
