This study aims to examine the associations between long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and sleep disorders in children. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey, including 185,428 children aged 6-18 years in 173 schools across 14 Chinese cities during 2012 and 2018. Parents or guardians completed a checklist using Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children, and O<sub>3</sub> exposure at residential and school addresses was estimated using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model. We used generalized linear mixed models to test the associations with adjustment for factors including socio-demographic variables, lifestyle, meteorology and multiple pollutants. Mean concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, particulate matter with diameters \u22642.5\u00a0mm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) were 89.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 42.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 34.4\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were similar among provinces, while PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration varied significantly among provinces. Overall, 19.4% of children had at least one sleep disorder. Long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was positively associated with odds of sleep disorders for all subtypes. For example, each interquartile increment in home-school O<sub>3</sub> concentrations was associated with a higher odds ratio for global sleep disorder, at 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.26). Similar associations were observed for sleep disorder subtypes. The associations remained similar after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, these associations were heterogeneous regionally, with more prominent associations among children residing in southeast region than in northeast and northwest regions in China. We concluded that long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> is positively associated with risks of childhood sleep disorders. These associations varied by geographical region of China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
