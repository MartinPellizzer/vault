With a nanosecond pulse laser of 266 nm as pump light, transient spectra of O3 aqueous solutions (78-480 \u03bcM, pH 2.5-11.3) were acquired in the time range from -50 to 50 \u03bcs in the wavelength region from 190 to 225 nm. The measured transient spectra were linearly decomposed into the molar absorption coefficients and the concentration-time profiles of constituted chemical components with a multivariate curve resolution method. From the dependences of the time-averaged concentrations for 20 \u03bcs of the constituted chemicals on the initial concentration of O3, it was found that the transient spectra involve the decomposition of O3 and the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and a third component that is assigned to hydroxyl radical (OH) or perhydroxyl radical (HO2). Furthermore, the pH dependence of the time-averaged concentration of the third components indicates that HO2 is more probable than OH as the third component. The time-averaged concentration ratio of each chemical component to the initial O3 concentration depends on the pH conditions from -0.95 to -0.60 for O3, 0.98 to 1.2 for H2O2, 0.002 to 0.29 for OH, and 0.012 to 0.069 for HO2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Food Research Institute, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goto", "ForeName": "Takeyoshi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morisawa", "ForeName": "Yusuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higashi", "ForeName": "Noboru", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikehata", "ForeName": "Akifumi", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Yukihiro", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3170-83-0", "NameOfSubstance": "perhydroxyl radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23560681", "10.1021/ac400056m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
