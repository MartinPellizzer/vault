The results showed that BrO3(-) minimization was achieved in the catalytic ozonation with NiO, CuO, Fe3O4 and Al2O3 as catalysts and the percent reductions of BrO3(-) were 34.0%, 32.8%, 29.2% and 20.8% respectively. In the reaction R(ct), the ratio of concentration of *OH to O3, decreased with the reaction time, and the range of R(ct) was from 10(-8) to 10(-6). In the ozonation process, one of the main reaction pathways of BrO3(-) formation was the combination oxidation of Br(-) by *OH and then O3, another was the combination oxidation of Br(-) by O3 and then *OH. In the catalytic ozonation with Fe3O4 catalyst, the main pathway was the combination oxidation by *OH and then O3. Moreover, about 60.7% removal for UV254 was obtained after 20 min in the catalytic ozonation reaction. In our study, it was found that the catalytic ozonation process can effectively minimize the formation of BrO3(-) and also oxidize organic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China. wulin.peiking@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hong-Wei", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shao-Xia", "Initials": "SX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Miao", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1XJQ704R4", "NameOfSubstance": "cupric oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22619950"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
