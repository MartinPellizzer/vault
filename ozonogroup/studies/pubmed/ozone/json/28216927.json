There are various minimally invasive therapies (MITs) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Still, there is a need for therapy with lesser side effects and better outcome. We had studied the effect of intraprostatic ozone injection (IPOI) as an MIT for patients with BPH who have failed trial without catheter (TWOC).", "Thirty elderly patients with BPH with a prostate size of 30 g or more were enrolled for the study. Forty milliliters of ozone at a concentration of 30 \u03bcg/dl was injected in prostate (20 ml in each lateral lobe) per rectally. Prostate volume (PV) by ultrasonography was assessed after catheter removal on the 7<sup>th</sup> day and after 1 month.", "Totally thirty patients (mean age - 67.8 years) with mean prostatic volume (MPV) of 46.10cc received IPOI. MPV came as 44.96cc on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of postozone therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.008). Successful voiders showed a significant reduction in PV (mean = 13.12cc) as compared to unsuccessful voiders (mean = 2.61cc) after 1 month.", "Intraprostatic ozone injection helps to reduce the PV to some extent and can be helpful in patients who have failed TWOC even on alpha blockers and are unfit for TURP. Larger studies are required to assess the efficacy and long-term results of this technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Shabbir", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Deepti B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Solanki", "ForeName": "Fanindra S", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Pathak", "ForeName": "Ajay", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, NSCB Medical College, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Dhananjay", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Urol Ann", "NlmUniqueID": "101510823", "ISSNLinking": "0974-7796"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Roehrborn CG, McConnell JD.
