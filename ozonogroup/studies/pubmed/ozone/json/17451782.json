In particular, the effects of the disintegration treatment on the excess sludge production in MBR were investigated. Two MBRs were operated. In one reactor, a part of the mixed liquor was treated with NaOH and ozone gas consecutively and was returned to the bioreactor. The flow rate of the sludge disintegration stream was 1.5% of the influent flow rate. During the 200 days of operation, the MLSS level in the bioreactor with the disintegration treatment was maintained relatively constant at the range of 10,000-11,000 mg/L while it increased steadily up to 25,000 mg/L in the absence of the treatment. In the MBR with the sludge disintegration, relatively constant transmembrane pressures (TMPs) could be maintained for more than 6 months while the MBR without disintegration showed an abrupt increase of TMP in the later phase of the operation. In conclusion, a complete control of excess sludge production in the membrane-coupled bioreactor was possible without significant deterioration of the treated water quality and membrane performances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Yonsei University, 134 Shin-Chon Dong, Seo-Dae-Mun Gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Young-Khee", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ki-Ryong", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Kwang-Baik", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeom", "ForeName": "Ick-Tae", "Initials": "IT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "55X04QC32I", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17451782", "10.1016/j.watres.2007.02.028", "S0043-1354(07)00133-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
