Two-dimensional and three-dimensional configurations were evaluated for their efficacy to eliminate the interference caused by the high concentration of ubiquitous ions present in seawater, such as chloride and sulfate. A two-dimensional approach utilising a high capacity second dimension separation comprising two Dionex AS24 columns connected in series was applied successfully and permitted the determination of bromate in undiluted seawater samples injected directly onto the ion chromatography system. Using this approach the limit of detection (LOD) for bromate based on a signal to noise ratio of 3 was 1050 \u03bcg/L using a 500 \u03bcL injection loop. Good linearity was obtained for bromate with correlation coefficients for the calibration curves of 0.9981 and 0.9996 based on peak height and area, respectively. A three-dimensional method utilising two 10-port switching valves to allow sharing of the second suppressor and detector between the second and third dimension separations showed better resolution and detection for bromate and reduced the LOD to 60 \u03bcg/L for spiked seawater samples. Good linearity was maintained with correlation coefficients of 0.9991 for both peak height and area. Ozonated seawater samples were also analysed and exhibited a non-linear increase in bromate level on increasing ozonation time. A bromate concentration in excess of 1770 \u03bcg/L was observed following ozonation of the seawater sample for 120 min. Recoveries for the three-dimensional system were 92% and 89% based on peak height and area, respectively, taken over 5 ozonated samples with 3 replicates per sample."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
