In certain scenarios, when the casework sample is contaminated with highly contagious pathogens, additional safety procedures such as disinfection might be advised. It was previously proven that ozone gas treatment does not hamper STR analysis, but there is no data on how the disinfection affects other steps of the forensic analysis. In this study, we aimed to assess the interference of ozone disinfection with forensic tests used to identify biological stains. A dilution series of blood, saliva, and semen samples were pipetted onto cotton fabric and let completely dry. Half of the samples were subjected to ozone treatment, while the rest served as controls. All the samples were tested with specific lateral flow immunochromatographic assays and for specific RNA markers with quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, luminol test was carried out on blood spots, Phadebas\u00ae Amylase Test on saliva stains, and semen stains were examined with STK Lab kit and light microscope following Christmas Tree or Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. Ozone treatment had no detrimental effect on the microscopic identification of sperm cells. Undiluted blood samples were detected with luminol and immunoassay, but at higher dilution, the sensitivity of the test decreased after disinfection. The same decrease in sensitivity was observed in the detection of semen stains using STK Lab kit from STK\u00ae Sperm Tracker, and in the case of the immunoassay specific for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Ozone treatment almost completely inhibited the enzymatic activity of amylase. The sensitivity of antibody-based detection of amylase was also greatly reduced. RNA markers showed degradation but remained detectable in blood and semen samples after incubation in the presence of ozone. In saliva, the higher Ct values of the mRNA markers were close to the detection limit, even before ozone treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
