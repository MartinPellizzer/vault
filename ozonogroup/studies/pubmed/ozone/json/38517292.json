However, epidemiological evidence linking ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure to diabetes risk has been scarcely studied in Zhuang adults in China. We aimed to investigate the associations of long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> with diabetes prevalence and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and estimate the mediating role of liver enzymes in Zhuang adults. <i>Methods</i>: We recruited 13\u2009843 ethnic minority adults during 2018-2019 based on a cross-sectional study covering nine districts/counties in Guangxi. Generalized linear mixed models were implemented to estimate the relationships between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and diabetes prevalence and FPG. Mediation effect models were constructed to investigate the roles of liver enzymes in the associations of O<sub>3</sub> exposure with diabetes prevalence and FPG. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential effect modifications. <i>Results</i>: Long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was positively associated with diabetes prevalence and FPG levels in Zhuang adults, with an excess risk of 7.32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.56%, 12.30%) and an increase of 0.047 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI: 0.032, 0.063) for diabetes prevalence and FPG levels, respectively, for each interquartile range (IQR, 1.18 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>) increment in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) significantly mediated 8.10% and 29.89% of the associations of O<sub>3</sub> with FPG and diabetes prevalence, respectively, and the corresponding mediation proportions of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were 8.48% and 30.00%. Greater adverse effects were observed in females, obese subjects, people with a low education level, rural residents, non-clean fuel users, and people with a history of stroke and hypertension in the associations of O<sub>3</sub> exposure with diabetes prevalence and/or FPG levels (all <i>P</i> values for interaction < 0.05). <i>Conclusion</i>: Long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> is related to an increased risk of diabetes, which is partially mediated by liver enzymes in Chinese Zhuang adults. Promoting clean air policies and reducing exposure to environmental pollutants should be a priority for public health policies geared toward preventing diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, No. 22, Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, China. xqqiu9999@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiaoyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Han", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, No. 22, Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, China. xqqiu9999@163.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Huishen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, No. 22, Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, China. xqqiu9999@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, No. 22, Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, China. xqqiu9999@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Xiaoyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sanitary Chemistry, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Dongping", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, No. 22, Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, China. liushun@gxmu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shun", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9881-3664"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, No. 22, Shuangyong Road, Nanning, Guangxi, China. xqqiu9999@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Xiaoqiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38517292", "10.1039/d3em00463e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
