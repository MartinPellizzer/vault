In highly polluted regions, combustion processes are one of the main sources of aerosols and particulate matter (PM) concentrations, which affect the radiative budget. Despite the high relevance of this air pollution metric, BC monitoring is quite expensive in terms of instrumentation and of maintenance and servicing. With the aim to provide tools to estimate BC while minimising instrumentation costs, we use machine learning approaches to estimate BC from air pollution and meteorological parameters (NO<sub>x</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, relative humidity (RH), and solar radiation (SR)) from currently available networks. We assess the effectiveness of various machine learning models, such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network, for predicting black carbon (BC) mass concentrations in areas with high BC levels such as Northern Indian cities (Delhi and Agra), across different seasons. The results demonstrate comparable effectiveness among the models, with the multilayer perceptron (MLP) showing the most promising results. In addition, the comparability between estimated and monitored BC concentrations was high. In Delhi, the MLP shows high correlations between measured and modelled concentrations during winter (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.85) and post-monsoon (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.83) seasons, and notable metrics in the pre-monsoon (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.72). The results from Agra are consistent with those from Delhi, highlighting the consistency of the neural network's performance. These results highlight the usefulness of machine learning, particularly MLP, as a valuable tool for predicting BC concentrations. This approach provides critical new opportunities for urban air quality management and mitigation strategies and may be especially valuable for megacities in medium- and low-income regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
