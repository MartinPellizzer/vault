However, these reactions can also occur on indoor surfaces, especially for low-volatility organics. Conversion rates of ozone with \u03b1-terpineol, a representative low-volatility compound, were quantified on surfaces that mimic indoor substrates. Rates were measured for \u03b1-terpineol adsorbed to beads of glass, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and dry latex paint, in a plug flow reactor. A newly defined second-order surface reaction rate coefficient, k(2), was derived from the flow reactor model. The value of k(2) ranged from 0.68 \u00d7 10(-14) cm(4)s(-1)molecule(-1) for \u03b1-terpineol adsorbed to PVC to 3.17 \u00d7 10(-14) cm(4)s(-1)molecule(-1) for glass, but was insensitive to relative humidity. Further, k(2) is only weakly influenced by the adsorbed mass but instead appears to be more strongly related to the interfacial activity \u03b1-terpineol. The minimum reaction probability ranged from 3.79 \u00d7 10(-6) for glass at 20% RH to 6.75 \u00d7 10(-5) for PVC at 50% RH. The combination of high equilibrium surface coverage and high reactivity for \u03b1-terpineol suggests that surface conversion rates are fast enough to compete with or even overwhelm other removal mechanisms in buildings such as gas-phase conversion and air exchange."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Agriculture, and Environmental Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 65401, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "Glenn C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21334LVV8W", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-terpineol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-86-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyl Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paint"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21517064", "10.1021/es200194e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
