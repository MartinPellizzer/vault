The DMOC time series for each of these regions were divided into four terms representing different behavioral time scales: the long-term mean; the mean in-tra-annual perturbation; the interannual perturbation; and the synoptic perturbation. The urban regions had smaller values of the long-term mean ozone, but the annual range was larger. The values of the interannual perturbation were largest in the summer, when ozone production is significant, and smallest in the late winter and early spring. The interannual perturbation in the summer in the four regions consistently had positive departures in 1983, 1988, and 1991, and it had negative departures in 1981, 1984, 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1992. Summers with large positive interannual departures experienced a large number of ozone exceedances (i.e., relative to the 1-hr National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 125 parts per billion [ppb]), and summers with large negative departures experienced few or no exceedances. About 50% of the exceedances had concentrations ranging in value from 125-135 ppb, and about 75% had concentrations from 125-145 ppb."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Science Applications International Corporation , Raleigh , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vukovich", "ForeName": "Fred M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b United States Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wayland", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Maryland Department of Natural Resources , Power Plant Research Program , Annapolis , Maryland , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sherwell", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28060655", "10.1080/10473289.1999.10463851"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
