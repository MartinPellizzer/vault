We use the GEOS-Chem adjoint model to analyze the precursors contributing to surface ozone in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area (BTH) of China on days of different ozone pollution severities in June 2019. We find that BTH ozone on heavily polluted days is sensitive to local emissions, as well as to precursors emitted from the provinces south of BTH (Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu, collectively the SHJ area). Heavy ozone pollution in BTH can be mitigated effectively by reducing NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> (from industrial processes and transportation), \u2265C<sub>3</sub> alkenes (from on-road gasoline vehicles and industrial processes), and xylenes (from paint use) emitted from both BTH and SHJ, as well as by reducing CO (from industrial processes, transportation, and power generation) and \u2265C<sub>4</sub> alkanes (from industrial processes, paint and solvent use, and on-road gasoline vehicles) emissions from SHJ. In addition, reduction of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>, xylene, and \u2265C<sub>3</sub> alkene emissions within BTH would effectively decrease the number of BTH ozone-exceedance days. Our analysis pinpoint the key areas and activities for locally and regionally coordinated emission control efforts to improve surface ozone air quality in BTH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6772-0350"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaolin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8556-7326"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Soil and Groundwater Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518055, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Tzung-May", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2383-8431"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hansen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hanchen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard John A.
