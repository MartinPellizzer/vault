The sludge in the UASB reactor had an abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which had been anaerobically cultivated in a sulfate-rich culture medium including Fe-EDTA and yeast-extract as the carbon sources. Since the prominent reductions of Fe-EDTA and sulfate ion were observed, the contribution of SRB to Fe-EDTA degradation in the UASB reactor was confirmed. The aggregated sludge in the UASB reactor became gradually large reaching steady state with an equivalent diameter of 60-90 microm after 124 days operation. An increase of the amount of yeast extract addition to feed solution improved the Fe-EDTA removal efficiency up to 90%. Moreover, the combination of ozone treatment with SRB treatment further improved removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) in an actual photo-processing wastewater composed of fixing and developing wastes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Waseda University, 3-4-1 Ohkubo, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 169-8555, Japan. stsuneda@waseda.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuneda", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shiono", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dogan", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirata", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xenobiotics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xenobiotics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yeasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14753541"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
