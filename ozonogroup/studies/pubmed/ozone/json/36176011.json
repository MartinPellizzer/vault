Although mass spectrometry (MS) approaches have been well developed for the characterization of lipids, it still lacks an integrated and compact MS system that is capable of rapid and detailed lipid structural characterization and can be conveniently transferred into different laboratories. In this work, we describe a novel miniature MS system with the capability of both ozone-induced dissociation (OzID) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) for the assignment of sites of unsaturation and <i>sn-</i>positions in glycerolipids. A miniature ozone generator was developed, which can be operated at a relatively high pressure. By maintaining high-concentration ozone inside the linear ion trap, OzID efficiency was significantly improved for the identification of C\u2550C locations in unsaturated lipids, with reaction times as short as 10 ms. Finally, the miniature OzID MS system was applied to the analysis of C\u2550C locations and <i>sn-</i>positions of lipids from biological samples. Direct sampling and fast detection of changes in phospholipid isomers were demonstrated for the rapid discrimination of breast cancer tissue samples, showing the potential of the miniature OzID MS system for point-of-care analysis of lipid isomer biomarkers in complex samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xinwei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Wenbo", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1205-6485"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiaoxiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8694-9900"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8560-756X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility and School of Chemistry and Physics, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland 4000, Australia."}], "LastName": "Blanksby", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7018-930X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenpeng", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7932-0933"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Point-of-Care Systems"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "56"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36176011", "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
