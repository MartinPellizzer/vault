To accomplish this, rats were exposed for 8 hours daily to an atmosphere containing either nebulized H(2)SO(4), H(2)SO(4) plus 0.9 ppm O(3), or 0.9 ppm O(3). The atmosphere in the exposure chambers was maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity. Nebulized H(2)SO(4) was delivered uniformly to provide a particle size of about 0.3 micron mass median diameter (MMD) and a mass concentration of 2 mg/m(3). In preliminary experiments, animals exposed to 2 mg/m(3) of H(2)SO(4) daily for 82 days showed very slight morphologic injury to the respiratory tract. In contrast, biological effects were readily demonstrable in rats exposed to H(2)SO(4) plus O(3) or to O(3) alone, possibly with some enhancement of effect in animals exposed to the mixture. The effects observed were characteristic of the response to O(3) alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Sciences, Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, CA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Juhos", "ForeName": "L T", "Initials": "LT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mussenden-Harvey", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furiosi", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lapple", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freeman", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health C", "NlmUniqueID": "7804129", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1242"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["659813"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
