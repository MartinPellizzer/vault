Herein, the mesoporous carbon with atomic Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites embedded in the ordered carbon nanochannels (Fe-N<sub>4</sub>/CMK-3) was synthesized by the hard-template method. Fe-N<sub>4</sub>/CMK-3 can be employed as nanoreactors with preferred electronic and geometric catalytic microenvironments for the internal catalytic ozonation of CH<sub>3</sub>SH. During the CH<sub>3</sub>SH oxidation process, the mass transfer coefficient of the Fe-N<sub>4</sub>/CMK-3 confined system with sufficient O<sub>3</sub> transfer featured a level of at least 1.87 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup>, which is 34.6 times that of the Fe-N<sub>4</sub>/C-Si unconfined system. Detailed experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the anchored atomic Fe-N<sub>4</sub> sites and nanoconfinement effects regulated the local electronic structure of the catalyst and promoted the activation of O<sub>3</sub> molecules to produce atomic oxygen species (AOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), eventually achieving efficient oxidation of CH<sub>3</sub>SH into CO<sub>2</sub>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Benefiting from the high diffusion rate and the augmentation of AOS/ROS, Fe-N<sub>4</sub>/CMK-3 exhibited an excellent poisoning tolerance, along with high catalytic durability. This contribution provides the proof-of-concept strategy for accelerating catalytic ozonation of sulfur-containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by combining confined catalysis and atomic catalysts and can be extended to the purification of other gaseous pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Manhui", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Zhuoyun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Huinan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Lingling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6016-358X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Dehua", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9734-9932"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Shuanghong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6915-6714"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3875-5631"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37487235", "10.1021/acs.est.2c08101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
