The ozonolysis was conducted till a molar ratio O3/C=C\u22481 when the exothermal reaction spontaneously went to completion. A specific thermochemical calculation on ethyl oleate ozonation has been made to determine the theoretical heat of the ozonization reaction using the group increment approach. A linear relationship was found both in the integrated absorptivity of the ozonide infrared band at 1110 cm(-1) and the ozonolysis time as well as the thermal decomposition enthalpy of the ozonides and peroxides formed as a result of the ozonation. The DSC decomposition temperature of ozonated ethyl oleate occurs with an exothermal peak at about 150-155 \u00b0C with a decomposition enthalpy of 243.0 kJ/mol at molar ratio O3/C=C\u22481. It is shown that the decomposition enthalpy of ozonized ethyl oleate is a constant value (\u2248243 kJ/mol) at any stage of the O3/C=C once an adequate normalization of the decomposition enthalpy for the amount of the adsorbed ozone is taken into consideration. The decomposition enthalpy of ozonized ethyl oleate was also calculated using a simplified thermochemical model, obtaining a result in reasonable agreement with the experimental value."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
