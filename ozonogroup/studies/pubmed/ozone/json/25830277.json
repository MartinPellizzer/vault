The animals were divided into 5 groups. Groups 1 and 2 were treated IP for a period of 10 d with daily medical ozone therapy. Group 3 received radiotherapy into the abdomen for 5 d. Groups 4 and 5 were treated with medical ozone therapy for 10 d and radiotherapy for 5 d. Groups 1 and 4 received a 20 mg/L concentration of ozone and groups 2 and 5 received a 40 mg/L concentration. A sixth group acted as controls, and serum physiologic was given to them IP.", "Changes in body weight and abdominal circumference were measured daily for each mouse. Survival rates of the groups of mice were also determined. The results were compared between groups and were statistically analyzed.", "Changes in body weights and abdominal circumferences in the different groups were statistically different. The longest survival rates were found for groups 3 and 5, and survival rates for the 5 experimental groups were significantly higher than for the control group.", "Medical ozone therapy or radiotherapy was found to be effective when administered alone or concurrently to mice with PC, suggesting that medical ozone therapy might serve as a method of obtaining antiedema and antitumor effects, providing a longer survival time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "K\u0131z\u0131ltan", "ForeName": "Huriye \u015eenay", "Initials": "H\u015e"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bayir", "ForeName": "Ay\u015fe G\u00fcne\u015f", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yucesan", "ForeName": "Gul", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eris", "ForeName": "Ali Hikmet", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "\u0130din", "ForeName": "Kadir", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karatoprak", "ForeName": "Cumali", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aydin", "ForeName": "Teoman", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akcakaya", "ForeName": "Adem", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mayadagli", "ForeName": "Alpaslan", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "radiotherapy"], "DescriptorName": "Ascites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "radiotherapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25830277"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
