Stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) is a key determinant of stomatal ozone uptake. The parameterization of g<sub>s</sub> models for estimating stomatal ozone uptake of trees has mainly been carried out using g<sub>s</sub> data measured in seedling leaves although the leaf traits may differ between mature trees and seedlings. In the present study, we compared stomatal ozone uptake estimated by g<sub>s</sub> models parameterised with data from mature trees and seedlings of Zelkova serrata. We measured g<sub>s</sub> in leaves of mature trees and seedlings of Z. serrata using a leaf porometer for 3-4 growing seasons. The Jarvis-type g<sub>s</sub> model was parameterised with data from mature trees and seedlings, separately. The maximum g<sub>s</sub>, and the functions of the seedling g<sub>s</sub> estimation model regarding the response to air temperature, vapour pressure deficit and atmospheric ozone concentration were the factors inducing lower stomatal ozone uptake. In contrast, the function of the seedling g<sub>s</sub> estimation model regarding the response to irradiance resulted in a higher estimated stomatal ozone uptake. The estimated stomatal ozone uptake for one growing season (April-September) by the seedling g<sub>s</sub> estimation model was 27% lower than that by the mature tree g<sub>s</sub> estimation model. These results indicate that leaf gas exchange traits of Z. serrata were different between mature trees and seedlings, and that estimating ozone uptake in mature tree leaves using a model based on seedling g<sub>s</sub> measurements results in an underestimation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
