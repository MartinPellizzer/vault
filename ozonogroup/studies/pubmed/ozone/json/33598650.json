Transient peaks in raw water faecal contamination were identified using <i>in situ</i> online \u03b2-d-glucuronidase activity monitoring at two urban drinking water treatment plants. During these peaks, sequential grab samples were collected at the source and throughout the treatment train to evaluate concentrations of rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, enterovirus, JC virus, reovirus, astrovirus and sapovirus by reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR. Virus infectivity was assessed through viral culture by measurement of cytopathic effect and integrated cell culture qPCR. Virus concentrations increased by approximately 0.5-log during two snowmelt/rainfall episodes and approximately 1.0-log following a planned wastewater discharge upstream of the drinking water intake and during a \u03b2-d-glucuronidase activity peak in dry weather conditions. Increases in the removal of adenovirus and rotavirus by coagulation/flocculation processes were observed during peak virus concentrations in source water, suggesting that these processes do not operate under steady-state conditions but dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions. Rotavirus and enterovirus detected in raw and treated water samples were predominantly negative in viral culture. At one site, infectious adenoviruses were detected in raw water and water treated by a combination of ballasted clarification, ozonation, GAC filtration, and UV disinfection operated at a dose of 40\u00a0mJ\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>. The proposed sampling strategy can inform the understanding of the dynamics associated with virus concentrations at drinking water treatment plants susceptible to de facto wastewater reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NSERC Industrial Chair on Drinking Water, Department of Civil, Geological, and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3A7, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Canada Research Chair in Source Water Protection, Department of Civil, Geological, and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3A7, Canada."}], "LastName": "Sylvestre", "ForeName": "\u00c9mile", "Initials": "\u00c9"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NSERC Industrial Chair on Drinking Water, Department of Civil, Geological, and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3A7, Canada."}], "LastName": "Pr\u00e9vost", "ForeName": "Mich\u00e8le", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NSERC Industrial Chair on Drinking Water, Department of Civil, Geological, and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3A7, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Canada Research Chair in Source Water Protection, Department of Civil, Geological, and Mining Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3A7, Canada."}], "LastName": "Burnet", "ForeName": "Jean-Baptiste", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, 116th & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health Laboratory, Alberta Precision Laboratories, 8440-112nd, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2J2, Canada."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Xiaoli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, 116th & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KWR Water Research Institute, Groningenhaven 7, 3433 PE, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Smeets", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KWR Water Research Institute, Groningenhaven 7, 3433 PE, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sanitary Engineering, Department of Water Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technology, P.O.
