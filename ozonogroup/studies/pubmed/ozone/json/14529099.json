We previously demonstrated that Bakumondo-to attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the mechanism whereby Bakumondo-to inhibits ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. First, we examined the effect of Bakumondo-to on prostanoids production, which are key mediators to airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone exposure. Second, we studied its effects on the vagal neuroeffector transmission, because vagal nerve is likely to play an important role in airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone.", "We measured the effects of Bakumondo-to on the concentrations of prostanoids in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and after ozone. We evaluated the effects of Bakumondo-to on the contraction of guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle evoked by electrical field stimulation (EFS) or the exogenous application of acetylcholine (ACh). Isometric tension of tracheal strips was measured in the presence of indomethacin (10(-6) M) and of guanethidine (10(-6) M).", "Ozone caused significant increase in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2); however, Bakumondo-to did not affect the increase in these prostanoids. Bakumondo-to (0.01 mg/mL-1 mg/mL) significantly suppressed the contraction evoked by EFS, but did not affect the ACh-evoked contraction, indicating that Bakumondo-to suppressed tracheal smooth muscle contraction pre-junctionally.", "These results suggest that the mechanism by which Bakumondo-to inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness depends on inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from vagal nerve terminals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Japan. aizawa@med.kurume-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aizawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitussive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bakumondo-to"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antitussive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electric Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Isometric Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "innervation"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroeffector Junction"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Synaptic Transmission"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "innervation", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Vagus Nerve"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14529099", "10.1081/jas-120018779"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
