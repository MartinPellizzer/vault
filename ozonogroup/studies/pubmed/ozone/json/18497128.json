To do this, we examined the relationship between mean summer PM2.5 and OC concentrations at 39 IMPROVE sites with a database of fires developed from federal fire reports. The gridded database of area burned was used to generate a database of biomass fuel burned using ecosystem-specific fuel loads. The OC, PM2.5, and fire data were evaluated for five regions: Northern Rocky Mountains (Region 1), Central Rocky Mountains (Region 2), Southwest (Region 3), California (Region 4), and Pacific Northwest (Region 5). In Regions 1, 2, and 5, we found good correlations of seasonal mean PM2.5 concentrations among the sites within each region. This indicates that a common influence was important in determining the PM concentration at all sites across each region. In Regions 1 and 2, we found a significant correlation between PM2.5 and both the area burned and biomassfuel burned in each region. This relationship is statistically significant using either the area burned or fuel burned, but the correlations are stronger using the biomass fuel burned. In all five regions we found a statistically significant relationship between biomass burned and organic carbon. Using these relationships, we can estimate the amount of PM2.5 due to fires in each region during summer. For the Regions 1 through 5, the average summer-long enhancement of PM2.5 due to fires is 1.84, 1.09, 0.61, 0.81, and 1.21 microg/m3, respectively, and approximately twice these values during large fire years."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Washington, Bothell, 18115 Campus Way NE, Bothell, Washington 98011, USA. djaffe@u.washington.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaffe", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hafner", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chand", "ForeName": "Duli", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Westerling", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spracklen", "ForeName": "Dominick", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fires"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18497128", "10.1021/es702755v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
