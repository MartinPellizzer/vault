To generate a thick oxidation layer (<\u223c7 \u00b5m), a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) slab of uniform or varying thickness was exposed to UV/ozone for less than 30 min in the UV-C wavelength including wavelengths of 185 and 254 nm. Subsequently, the PDMS slab was wrapped on a cylindrical support (radius: 11 mm) to apply a uniform bending strain (<21%), resulting in equally separated, anisotropic cracks over a large area. By modulating initial oxidation depth and applied bending stress, cracks of varying sizes and spaces were formed on a single PDMS slab. Furthermore, multiple, sequential cracks were generated by increasing the strain in a step-wise fashion and multi-directional cracks by applying the strain with an orientation angle. Finally, size and space-varying cracks were formed between two adjacent large channels in an interconnected format by selective masking and irreversible bonding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hong-Nam", "Initials": "HN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sung-Hoon", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "Kahp-Yang", "Initials": "KY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lab Chip", "NlmUniqueID": "101128948", "ISSNLinking": "1473-0189"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21088797", "10.1039/c0lc00277a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
