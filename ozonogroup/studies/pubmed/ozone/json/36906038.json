In order to study these pressures, birds represent excellent model organisms due to their high diversity and position at the top of food chains. The pressures upon mountain bird populations include climate change, human disturbance, land abandonment, and air pollution, whose impacts are little understood. Ambient ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the most important air pollutants occurring in elevated concentrations in mountain conditions. Although laboratory experiments and indirect course-scale evidence suggest its negative effects on birds, population-level impacts remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed a unique 25-years long time series of annual monitoring of bird populations conducted at fixed sites under constant effort in a Central European mountain range, the Giant Mountains, Czechia. We related annual population growth rates of 51 bird species to O<sub>3</sub> concentrations measured during the breeding season and hypothesized (i) an overall negative relationship across all species, and (ii) more negative O<sub>3</sub> effects at higher altitudes due to increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentration along altitudinal gradient. After controlling for the influence of weather conditions on bird population growth rates, we found an indication of the overall negative effect of O<sub>3</sub> concentration, but it was insignificant. However, the effect became stronger and significant when we performed a separate analysis of upland species occupying the alpine zone above treeline. In these species, populations growth rates were lower after the years experiencing higher O<sub>3</sub> concentration indicating an adverse impact of O<sub>3</sub> on bird breeding. This impact corresponds well to O<sub>3</sub> behaviour and mountain bird ecology. Our study thus represents the first step towards mechanistic understanding of O<sub>3</sub> impacts on animal populations in nature linking the experimental results with indirect indications at the country-level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
