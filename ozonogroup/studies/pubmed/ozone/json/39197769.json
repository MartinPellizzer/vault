This study proposes a novel mass-integrated combined heat and power system and conducts energy analysis, exergy analysis, and techno-economic analysis for the system. The optimization strategy integrated polynomial regression and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is established, with system thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, and return on investment (ROI) as objective functions. The system's environmental consequences are then assessed throughout its life cycle using life cycle assessment (LCA) under ideal operating circumstances. The findings reveal that the waste heat recovery heat exchanger has the highest exergy destruction in the system, with a value of 674.61\u00a0kW. Furthermore, the intermediate heat exchanger 1 and intermediate heat exchanger 2 (IHX2) with lesser exergy efficiency have an exergy destruction of less than 32.00\u00a0kW. The IHX2 is the most expensive equipment in the system, costing $90,931.19, but it also provides the most potential for system improvement. The multi-objective optimization findings suggest that the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, and ROI for the system are 0.17, 0.97, and 0.30, respectively. The LCA demonstrates that the system has a negligible influence on global warming and ozone generation with corresponding LCA findings of less than 4.20. The construction and operation phases of the investigation system have the most significant environmental consequences. The correlation between the raw materials necessary for the construction of the equipment in the system and the reaction temperatures, conditions, and waste composition during the preparation of the working fluids is large, so it is necessary to take corresponding environmental protection measures during production and processing to reduce the system's environmental emissions from the source and promote ecologically sustainable development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
