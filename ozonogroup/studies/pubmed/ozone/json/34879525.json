We performed a detailed evaluation based on data from national insurance databases in China. Daily hospital admissions for anxiety disorders were identified in 2013-2017 from the national insurance databases covering up to 261 million urban residents in 56 cities in China. A two-stage time-series study was conducted to evaluate the associations between short-term exposure to major ambient air pollutants, including fine particles, inhalable particles, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone, and carbon monoxide, and risk of daily hospital admissions for anxiety. Significant associations between short-term exposures to ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> and risk of daily hospital admissions for anxiety were found in the overall analysis. Per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increases in NO<sub>2</sub> at lag0 and SO<sub>2</sub> at lag6 were associated with significant increases of 1.37% (95%\u00a0CI: 0.14%, 2.62%) and 1.53% (95% CI: 0.59%, 2.48%) in anxiety admissions, respectively. Stronger associations were found in the southern region and patients <65 years for SO<sub>2</sub>. Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increased risk of anxiety admissions, which may provide important implications for promotion of mental health in the public."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
