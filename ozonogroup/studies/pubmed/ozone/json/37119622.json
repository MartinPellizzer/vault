The effect of ultra-sonication (US), ozonation and enzymatic hydrolysis on increasing the bioavailability of organic matter in CWW and biogas production were evaluated. The pre-treatment conditions were: specific energy input varied from 2130 to 8773KJ/KgTS for a sonication time of 4.5-18.5\u00a0min, Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) dosages ranging from 0.03 to 0.045gO<sub>3</sub>/gTS were applied for 4-16\u00a0min, pH (3.8-7.1), temperature (35\u00b0C-55\u00b0C), enzyme dosage (0.18-0.52%), was operated from 7.75 to 53\u00a0min for enzymatic hydrolysis by \u03b2-galactosidase. The results of the US reported a maximum sCOD solubilisation of 77.15% after 18.5\u00a0min of operation, while the corresponding values for ozonation and enzymatic methods were 64.8% at 16\u00a0min and 54.79%, respectively. The organic matter degradation rates evaluated in terms of protein and lactose hydrolysis were 68.78%,46.03%; 47.83%,16.15% and 54.22%,86.2%respectively, for US, ozonation and enzymatic methods. The cumulative methane yield for sonicated, ozonised and enzymatically hydrolysed samples were 412.4\u00a0ml/g VS, 361.2\u00a0ml/g VS and 432.3mlCH<sub>4</sub>/gVS, respectively. Regardless of the lower COD solubilisation rates attained, enzymatic pre-treatment showed maximum methane generation compared to US and ozonation. This could be attributable to the increased activity of \u03b2-galactosidase in hydrolysing whey lactose. The energy calculations revealed that the pre-conditioning of organic-rich CWW with enzymatic hydrolysis is more effective and efficient, yielding a net energy gain (gross output energy-input energy) of 9166.7\u00a0KJ and an energy factor (ratio of output to input energy) of 6.67.
