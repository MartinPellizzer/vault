However, given the complexity of atmospheric chemistry, the nuanced implications on air quality are yet to be fully understood. Our study delved into changes in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, ozone, and their associated precursors in major US urban areas, considering various electrification and mitigation scenarios. In the full electrification (FullE) scenario, PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction peaked at values between 0.34 and 2.29\u00a0\u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup> across distinct regions. Yet, certain areas in eastern Los Angeles exhibited a surprising uptick in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, reaching as much as 0.67\u00a0\u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup>. This phenomenon was linked to a surge in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), resulting from shifting NOx/VOCs (volatile organic compounds) dynamics and a spike in hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. The FullE scenario ushered in marked reductions in both NOx and maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) ozone concentrations, with maximum levels ranging from 14.00 to 32.34\u00a0ppb and 2.58-9.58\u00a0ppb, respectively. However, certain instances revealed growths in MDA8 ozone concentrations, underscoring the intricacies of air quality management. From a health perspective, in the FullE scenario, New York, Chicago, and Houston stand to potentially avert 796, 328, and 157 premature deaths/month, respectively. Los Angeles could prevent 104 premature deaths/month in the HighE-BL scenario, representing a 29\u00a0% EV share for light-duty vehicles. However, the FullE scenario led to a rise in mortality in Los Angeles due to increased PM<sub>2.5</sub> and MDA8 ozone levels. Economically, the FullE scenario projects health benefits amounting to 51-249 million $/day for New York, Chicago, and Houston. In contrast, Los Angeles may face economic downturns of up to 18 million $/day. In conclusion, while EV integration has the potential to improve urban air quality, offering substantial health and economic advantages, challenges persist. Our results emphasize the pivotal role of VOCs management, providing policymakers with insights for adaptable and efficient measures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
