Episodic ozone (O\u2083) is more reflective of potential exposures occurring in human populations and could be more harmful to the aged. This study used radiotelemetry to monitor heart rate (HR), core temperature (T(c)) and motor activity (MA) in adult (9-12 months) and senescent (20-24 months) male, Brown Norway rats exposed to episodic O\u2083 (6\u2009h/day of 1\u2009ppm O\u2083 for 2 consecutive days/week for 13 weeks). Acute O\u2083 initially led to marked drops in HR and T(c). As exposures progressed each week, there was diminution in the hypothermic and bradycardic effects of O\u2083. Senescent rats were less affected than adults. Acute responses were exacerbated on the second day of O\u2083 exposure with adults exhibiting greater sensitivity. During recovery following 2\u2009d of O\u2083, adult and senescent rats exhibited an elevated T(c) and HR during the day but not at night, an effect that persisted for at least 48\u2009h after O\u2083 exposure. MA was elevated in adults but not senescent rats during recovery from O\u2083. Overall, acute effects of O\u2083, including reductions in HR and T(c), were attenuated in senescent rats. Autonomic responses during recovery, included an elevation in T(c) with a pattern akin to that of a fever and rise in HR that were independent of age. An attenuated inflammatory response to O\u2083 in senescent rats may explain the relatively heightened physiological response to O\u2083 in younger rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicity Assessment Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA ."}], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johnstone", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aydin", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "MacPhail", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "U P", "Initials": "UP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jarema", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Bradycardia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxicity Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred BN"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tachyphylaxis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Subchronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicokinetics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24779854", "10.3109/08958378.2014.905659"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
