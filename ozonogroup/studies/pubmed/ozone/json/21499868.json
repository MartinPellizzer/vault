This article deals with dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) removal from drinking water by using a process of bentonite based adsorptive ozonation. This process is formed by combined addition of ozone, bentonite and Fe(3+). During the reaction, DCAA is removed by the joint effect of adsorption, ozonation and catalytic oxidation. In addition, under the effect of the adsorption, natural organic matters (NOM) can be adsorbed onto the bentonite surface, resulting in a reduced scavenging effect toward HO\u00b7 radicals, and hence eliminate the negative effect of NOM on DCAA removal. At the initial stage of the reaction, Fe(3+) is rapidly hydrolyzed to polycations and adsorbed onto the bentonite surface or into its structural layers. This positively charges the surface of the bentonite and increases its surface area, resulting in a strong adsorption of HA or DCAA. Furthermore, Fe(3+) catalyzes ozone decomposition to form HO\u00b7 thus further improving the efficiency. The adsorptive ozonation has been shown to be potentially advantageous in destruction of toxic, dissolved pollutants in drinking water, and appears to have great potential for a wide range of treatment applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key laboratory of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, 361021, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jinli", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "9885956", "ISSNLinking": "0963-9292"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1302-78-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Bentonite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9LSH52S3LQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Dichloroacetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bentonite"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dichloroacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Water Res. 2005 Sep;39(15):3553-64", "ArticleIdList": ["16095660"]}, {"Citation": "Water Sci Technol. 2004;50(5):23-8", "ArticleIdList": ["15497825"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2007 Jan;66(1):145-50", "ArticleIdList": ["16793113"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2005 Oct;39(16):3900-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16131464"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2005 Aug;39(13):2926-34", "ArticleIdList": ["16029883"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21499868", "10.1007/s10646-011-0680-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
