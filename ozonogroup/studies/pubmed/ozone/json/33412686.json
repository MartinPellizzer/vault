The content of certain minerals varies by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude between bottled water brands. The major cations Ca, Mg, Na, and K can be found in concentrations up to 730, 450, 1900, and 270\u00a0mg/L but are usually below 100\u00a0mg/L; higher concentrations have only been found in some European and North American bottled water samples. The dominating anions are HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> , Cl<sup>-</sup> , and SO<sub>4</sub> <sup>2-</sup> . Sensory evaluation and description of water strongly depend on personal preferences and sensitivities. The major cations can be detected by taste in concentrations down to 2 digits in the\u00a0mg/L range; however, the intensity depends on which anions are present. Most cations add different degrees of salty, sour, sweet, and bitter tastes to water depending on their concentrations. Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Zn may introduce metallic, astringent, and irritative sensations and for Fe and Cu also retro-nasal odors may influence the metallic sensation. Drinking water with total dissolved solids in the range of 100 to 400\u00a0mg/L results in good sensory quality. Known off-flavor problems originate from by-products of ozonation and leaching of organics from bottling material which may also be enhanced by ozonation, and microbial by-products from the source water such as geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol, lubricants, or cleaning agents used in the bottling industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, Univ. of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marcussen", "ForeName": "Helle", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, Univ. of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holm", "ForeName": "Peter E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, Univ. of Copenhagen, Thorvaldsensvej 40, 1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "Hans Chr B", "Initials": "HCB"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "strategic water research initiative ViVa at the Faculty of Life Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Compr Rev Food Sci Food Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "101305205", "ISSNLinking": "1541-4337"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ahmad M, Bajahlan AS. 2007.
