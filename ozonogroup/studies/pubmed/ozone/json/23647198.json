This approach has been challenged by recent studies suggesting that secondary organic aerosol (SOA) cannot reach equilibrium within atmospheric time scales. The emergent hypothesis is that gas-particle partitioning rates are limited by diffusion within the condensed phase, which is thought to be \"glassy.\" Here, we investigate the equilibration time scales of SOA formed from \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis by measuring the dynamic response to a modest step-change in temperature. Upon heating, equilibrium is disturbed, and the particles evaporate to restore equilibrium at the new temperature, which is attained when evaporation ceases. The SOA was formed at 10 \u00b0C and then heated to near room temperature (30 \u00b0C) so that the phase state (viscosity) of the condensed-phase after heating is similar to how it would be in the atmosphere. Experiments were performed in both a thermodenuder, with SOA loading of 350 \u03bcg/m(3), and in a smog chamber, with SOA loading of 2-12 \u03bcg/m(3). Both experiments show, contrary to previous findings, that the SOA achieves equilibrium with dynamic responses consistent with a mass accommodation coefficient of order 0.1. For typical atmospheric conditions, this translates into equilibration time scales on the order of minutes to tens of minutes, supporting the use of equilibrium partitioning in chemical transport models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saleh", "ForeName": "Rawad", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donahue", "ForeName": "Neil M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "Allen L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23647198", "10.1021/es400078d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
