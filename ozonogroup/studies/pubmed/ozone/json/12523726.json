The radical reaction model used in this simulator was found to be reasonable, because the results obtained from the simulation of a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system were in good agreement with the experimental results, e.g., the concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), hydrogen peroxide and dissolved ozone obtained from a lab-scale CSTR. Furthermore, by using this CFD simulator, the distributions of substances such as hydroxyl radical (OH*) and hydrogen peroxide in the O3/UV reactor have been investigated. These distributions showed that this CFD simulator was considered to be reasonable. In addition, the simulation results suggested that conventional reactors were not optimized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced R&D Technology Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corp., 8-1-1 Tsukaguchi-Honmachi Amagasaki Hyogo 661-8661, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamimura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furukawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirotsuji", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12523726"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
