Investigated AOPs included UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, UV/Cl<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/UV, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV, Cl<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV. AOPs were operated using various ozone doses (1.5-9\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), and UV fluences (191-981\u00a0mJ\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>). Electrical energy costs necessary for the oxidation of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) (i.e., carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim) were calculated using the electrical energy per order (E<sub>EO</sub>) parameter. Ozonation resulted by far the most energy efficient process, whereas UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> showed the highest energy costs. Energy costs for AOPs based on the combination of UV and ozone were in the order O<sub>3</sub>/UV\u00a0\u2248\u00a0Cl<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV\u00a0>\u00a0H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV, and they were significantly lower than energy costs of UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> processes. Cl<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV increased bromate formation, O<sub>3</sub>/UV and O<sub>3</sub> had same levels of bromate formation, whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>/UV did not form bromate. In addition, UV photolysis resulted an effective treatment for NDMA mitigation even in combination with ozone and chlorine in AOP technologies. Ozonation (doses of 1.5-6\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) was the least effective process to inactivate somatic coliphages, total coliform, escherichia coli, and enterococci. UV irradiation was able to completely inactivate somatic coliphages, total coliform, escherichia coli at low fluence (191\u00a0mJ\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>), whereas enterococci were UV resistant. AOPs that utilized UV irradiation were the most effective processes for wastewater disinfection resulting in a complete inactivation of selected indicator organisms by low ozone dose (1.5\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) and UV fluence (191-465\u00a0mJ\u00a0cm<sup>-2</sup>)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
