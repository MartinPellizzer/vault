Two scenarios, S1 and S2, representing different intensities of source segregation were analysed. In S1, the average source segregation intensity reached 25% and 13% for the Italian test area and Lebanese test area, respectively. In S2, source segregation intensity increased to 48% and 68% for the Italian and Lebanese test areas, respectively. Passing from S1 to S2 increased collection costs significantly, up to 44% with greater increases in the Italian test area where labour cost is higher. In both areas, environmental impacts decreased with greater source segregation intensity. Savings in the climate change impact and stratospheric ozone depletion potential were lower under the Lebanese test area in comparison with the Italian test area. In contrast, savings in freshwater eutrophication and acidification impact were lower for the Italian test area. The increase in the source segregation intensity resulted in maximum savings for the depletion of abiotic resources, 74% to 77% and 79% to 80% in a developing and developed context, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, American University of Beirut, Riad El-Solh, Lebanon."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4949-7746"], "LastName": "Maalouf", "ForeName": "Amani", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LAR Laboratory, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4343-6598"], "LastName": "Di Maria", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, American University of Beirut, Riad El-Solh, Lebanon."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2379-9006"], "LastName": "El-Fadel", "ForeName": "Mutasem", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9881064"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lebanon"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31607236", "10.1177/0734242X19877677"]}}]}
