For air exchange rates <3/h, the ratio of the breathing zone to the ozone concentration 1 m from the body (bulk air), r(ozone), ranges from 0.59 to 0.75 for floor or ceiling air supply. ORPHS are enriched in the breathing zone, with concentrations for these conditions ranging from 1.2 to 2.5 greater than bulk air concentrations. At high air exchange rates (>8/h), the breathing zone concentrations approach bulk air concentrations (r(ozone) > 0.9) with a floor supply, whereas large concentration gradients occur between breathing zone and bulk air with a ceiling supply. At these high air exchange rates, ORPHS levels are 1.6-2.0 and 2.9-6.0 times the bulk air concentrations for floor and ceiling supply, respectively. The extent of depletion of ozone or enrichment of ORPHS is large enough that reliance on micro-environmental measurements alone, to assess the intake of ozone or ORPHS, is undesirable.", "Chemical reactions between ozone and human and clothing surfaces are predicted to significantly reduce ozone concentrations, and increase ozone reaction products associated with human surfaces (ORPHS) concentrations, in the breathing zone, relative to those concentrations in the larger microenvironment of a room. Existing measurements may overestimate ozone exposure and intake in typical indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rim", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Novoselec", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morrison", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Indoor Air", "NlmUniqueID": "9423515", "ISSNLinking": "0905-6947"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19382954", "10.1111/j.1600-0668.2009.00595.x", "INA595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
