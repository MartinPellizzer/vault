In vitro study with deoxyguanosine (dGuo) showed that 1O(2) was responsible for drug-sensitized photodegradation of the guanine base of DNA and RNA. Sodium azide (NaN(3)) and 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABCO) accorded significant inhibition (76-98%) in the production of (1)O(2) and photo-oxidation of dGuo. The combined effect of drug and UV-B irradiation is of paramount importance in view of cell-damaging reactions by 1O(2). Our findings are important because of increasing UV-B radiation on the earth's surface due to depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. The selected drugs are used routinely for the treatment of various diseases and their combined action may cause undesirable phototoxic responses. Our study suggests that exposure to sunlight should be avoided after the intake of the photosensitive drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Photobiology Laboratory, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Post Box No. 80, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow- 226 001, India. itrc@sancharnet.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ray", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hans", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol In Vitro", "NlmUniqueID": "8712158", "ISSNLinking": "0887-2333"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G9481N71RO", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyguanosine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11869874", "10.1016/s0887-2333(01)00116-3", "S0887233301001163"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
