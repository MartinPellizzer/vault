However, only a few longitudinal studies have been conducted on their associations with long-term air pollution exposure.", "This study aimed to examine whether long-term air pollution exposure is associated with ABI and CAVI in workers of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR).", "This longitudinal study included 1261 participants (age range, 57-76 years as of 2007) of the EGAT study (2007-2017). ABI and CAVI were measured in 2007, 2012, and 2017. Annual mean concentrations of particulate matter \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) were estimated by ordinary kriging using data from 22 background and 7 traffic monitoring stations in BMR between 2002 and 2017. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess associations between air pollution (expressed as 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year average concentration) and ABI and CAVI (expressed as percent changes per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2,</sub> and CO). We also applied the mixed-effect ordinal logistic models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) of having high or moderate CAVI per an IQR increase in air pollution.", "After controlling for potential confounders, 1-year average CO was negatively associated with ABI, but not significantly (-0.48%, 95% CI: -1.03, 0.07). Three-year average NO<sub>2</sub> was positively associated with CAVI (6.67%, 95% CI: 0.21, 13.1). In contrast, 1-year average PM<sub>10</sub> was inversely associated with CAVI although the association was not significant. Although not significantly, 1-year average NO<sub>2</sub> and CO were positively associated with prevalence of high or moderate CAVI.", "Although not statistically significant, long-term NO<sub>2</sub> and CO exposure was associated with ABI and CAVI in the participants of the EGAT study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
