We measured BP by using an automated sphygmomanometer and obtained hourly data of air pollutants at a nearby site. The sum of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>x</sub>) and their weighted average (O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup>) were obtained as exposure variables. We applied linear mixed-effect models to evaluate the effects of O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup>on systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP).", "Totally, 160 pairs of valid BP values were obtained. The 24-h mean levels of O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> were 64.38\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 110.28\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Overall, both O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> were significantly linked with SBP, DBP and MAP at most lag periods, whereas non-significant with PP. A 10-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> at lag 0-24\u2009h was linked to increases of 2.43\u2009mmHg (95% CI: 0.96, 3.91) in SBP, 2.31\u2009mmHg (95% CI: 1.37, 3.26) in DBP and 2.35\u2009mmHg (95% CI: 1.35, 3.36) in MAP, while the corresponding effect estimates for O<sub>x</sub> were 1.51\u2009mmHg (95%CI: 0.60, 2.43), 1.43\u2009mmHg (95% CI: 0.85, 2.02) and 1.46\u2009mmHg (95%CI: 0.83, 2.09). In two-pollutant models, our results were almost unchanged after controlling for simultaneous exposure to other pollutants. The effects were more pronounced among males and those with physical activity.", "The findings provide first-hand evidence that short-term exposure to O<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>x</sub><sup>wt</sup> was associated with BP increases in young adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
