All patients were treated with a percutaneous ozone injection and one patient was excluded. There were 21 patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia (group A) and seven patients with painful trigeminal neuropathy caused by post-herpetic neuralgia (group B). The percutaneous injection was an oxygen-ozone mixture at an ozone concentration of 30 \u03bcg/mL into the Gasserian ganglion performed under CT guidance. The number of procedures performed varied from one to as many as 16. Outcomes were evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores.", "The combined VAS scores were 7.11 \u00b1 1.23 pretreatment, 2.86 \u00b1 1.69 posttreatment (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and 3.25 \u00b1 2.01 after 6-month follow-up (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In group A, the VAS scores were 7.10 \u00b1 1.04 pretreatment and 2.90 \u00b1 1.84 posttreatment (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In group B, the VAS scores were 7.14 \u00b1 1.77 pretreatment and 2.71 \u00b1 1.25 posttreatment (<i>P</i> < 0.05). After 6-months follow-up, the VAS score was 3.38 \u00b1 2.18 in group A and 2.86 \u00b1 1.46 in group B, a decrease compared to pretreatment (<i>P</i> < 0.05). VAS of Group A and B showed no difference not only in pretreatment but also in postreatment and follow-up.", "Percutaneous ozone injection is a safe and effective treatment for patients with refractory trigeminal neuralgia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine & Critical Care Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Weifang Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jian-Xiong", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine & Critical Care Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine & Critical Care Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Weifang Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ruo-Wen", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine & Critical Care Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine & Critical Care Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wen-Xing", "Initials": "WX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Services, Wirral University Teaching Hospital, Wirral, Merseyside, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eastwood", "ForeName": "Derek", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "John P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "New Zealand", "MedlineTA": "J Pain Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101540514", "ISSNLinking": "1178-7090"}, "CoiStatement": "Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Merskey H, Bogduk N.
