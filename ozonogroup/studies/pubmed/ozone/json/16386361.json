The results showed that the presence of AC improved ozone utilization and biodegradability of the effluent. For dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal, AC/O(3)-BAC was more efficient than O(3)-BAC and its synergetic effect could be noticed. It was showed that small molecules with molecular weight (MW)<3 kDa predominated in the raw water accounting for more than 56% DOC, and their amount increased after oxidation, accounting for more than 64% DOC. Except for organic pollutants with MW>10 kDa, those of other MW range were decomposed better by AC/O(3) process than by O(3) process alone. GC/MS analysis showed that AC/O(3)-BAC process was effective in removing phthalate esters (PAEs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). PAEs' removal ratio reached more than 93% and reduced with the increase of the length of the alkyl side chains and the alkyl branch chains. POPs-polybromobiphenyls' removal reached more than 94% except for 2,2',4,5',6-pentabromophenyl and decreased with the substitutional bromines increase except for 2,2',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl, which could be completely removed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou 510006, China. llsh99@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Laisheng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wanpeng", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pengyi", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiuyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zulin", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16386361", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.11.045", "S0304-3894(05)00738-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
