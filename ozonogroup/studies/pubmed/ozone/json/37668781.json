However, the evidence regarding the short-term effect of air pollution on cardio- and cerebrovascular hospitalisations in areas with relatively low air pollution levels is limited. This study aims to examine the effect of short-term exposure to different air pollutants on hospital admissions due to cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases in rural and regional Australia with low air pollution. The study was conducted in five local Government areas of Hunter New England Local Health District (HNE-LHD). Hospitalisation data from January 2018 to February 2020 (820 days) were accessed from the HNE-LHD admitted patients' dataset. Poisson regression model was used to examine the association between the exposure (air pollutants) and outcome variables (hospitalisation due to cardio- and cerebrovascular disease). The concentrations of gaseous air pollutants, Sulphur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) were below national benchmark concentrations for every day of the study period. In single pollutant models, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> significantly increased the daily number of cardio- and cerebrovascular hospitalisations. The highest cumulative effect for SO<sub>2</sub> was observed across lag 0-3 days (Incidence Rate Ratio, IRR: 1.77; 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.18-2.65; p-value: 0.01), and for NO<sub>2</sub>, it was across lag 0-2 days (IRR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02-1.25; p-value: 0.02). In contrast, higher O<sub>3</sub> was associated with decreased cardio- and cerebrovascular hospitalisations, with the largest effect observed at lag 0 (IRR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89-0.98; p-value: 0.02). In the multi-pollutant model, the effect of NO<sub>2</sub> remained significant at lag 0 and corresponded to a 21% increase in cardio- and cerebrovascular hospitalisation (95% CI: 1-44%; p-value = 0.04). Thus, the study revealed that gaseous air pollutants, specifically NO<sub>2</sub>, were positively related to increased cardio- and cerebrovascular hospitalisations, even at concentrations below the national standards."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
