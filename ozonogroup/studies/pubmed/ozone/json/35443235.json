However, the relationship between the adsorbed metal content and catalytic performance of the resulting nanomaterials is unclear. In this work,<i>Pichia pastoris residues</i>was utilized to adsorb Ce(\u2162) at different metal ion concentrations, and then CeO<sub>2</sub>@C nanomaterials were prepared by pyrolysis. The effects of solution pH and adsorption behavior were investigated. The prepared nanostructures were characterized using electron microscopy and different spectroscopy methods, and their catalytic performances in the removal of salicylic acid from solution by catalytic ozonation were invested. The microbial residue had a metal uptake of 172.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.82 mg\u00b7 g<sup>-1</sup>at pH 6. In addition, the efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) removal increased from 21.54% to 34.10% with an increase in metal content in the catalysts from 0 mg\u00b7 g<sup>-1</sup>to 170.05 mg\u00b7 g<sup>-1</sup>. After pyrolysis, the absorbed Ce(\u2162) metal transformed to CeO<sub>2</sub>metal nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix and had a core-shell CeO<sub>2</sub>@C structure. Therefore, this work not only reveals a relationship between metal content and catalytic performance, but also provides an approach for studying performance of materials with different metal contents loaded on various carriers."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ningning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Gangting", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3869-5990"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Flag Bio-Tech Co., Ltd, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Flag Bio-Tech Co., Ltd, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Haiyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Guanzhou", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5800-8465"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanostructures"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35443235", "10.1088/1361-6528/ac6885"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
