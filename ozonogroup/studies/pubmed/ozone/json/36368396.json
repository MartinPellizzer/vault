However, the factors contributing to ClNO<sub>2</sub> production and its impact on O<sub>3</sub> formation in the polluted atmosphere are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the causes and impacts of extremely high ClNO<sub>2</sub> levels (up to 8.3 ppbv, 1 min average) in a winter pollution episode at a semi-rural surface site in South China. Anthropogenic activities (mainly coal burning) produced an abundant amount of chloride, and high NO<sub>3</sub> production rates and efficient N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> uptake by aerosols facilitated ClNO<sub>2</sub> production at night. We used a chemical box model to assess the ClNO<sub>2</sub> impact on next-day O<sub>3</sub> production both at the site and in downwind areas. The model results showed that ClNO<sub>2</sub> chemistry led to 6.6 % enhancement of net O<sub>x</sub> (=NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>) production at the site, while the enhancement was increased to 11.2 % in the air mass transporting downwind, which resulted in 20 ppbv (38.5 % max) increment of peak O<sub>3</sub> concentration. ClNO<sub>2</sub> also changed the response of O<sub>3</sub> to reduction in the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> precursors (NO<sub>x</sub> and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), thereby affecting the design of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOC reduction strategies for O<sub>3</sub> pollution mitigation. Reducing chloride emissions can help alleviate the emission reduction burden for NO<sub>x</sub> and anthropogenic VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
