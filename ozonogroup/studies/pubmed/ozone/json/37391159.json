They play important role in microbial inactivation but could also pose a considerable selection effect on the microbial community of reclaimed water. Classical culture-based methods that rely on the assessment of conventional bacterial indicators (e.g., coliform bacteria) could hardly reflect the survival of disinfection residual bacteria (DRB) and hidden microbial risks in disinfected effluents. Hence, this study investigated the shifts of live bacterial community during ozone and chlorine disinfection in three reclaimed waters (i.e., two secondary effluents and one tertiary effluent), adopting Illumina Miseq sequencing technology in combination with a viability assay, propidium monoazide (PMA) pretreatment. Notably, statistical analyses of Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed the existance of distinct differences in bacterial community structure between samples with or without PMA pretreatment. On the phylum level, Proteobacteria commonly dominated in three undisinfected reclaimed waters, while ozone and chlorine disinfection posed varied effects on its relative abundance among different influents. On the genus level, ozone and chlorine disinfection significantly changed the bacterial composition and dominant species in reclaimed waters. Specifically, the typical DRB identified in ozone disinfected effluents were Pseudomonas, Nitrospira and Dechloromonas, while for chlorine disinfected effluents, Pseudomonas, Legionella, Clostridium, Mycobacterium and Romboutsia were recognized as typical DRB, which call for much attention. The Alpha and Beta diversity analysis results also suggested that different influent compositions greatly affected the bacterial community structure during disinfection processes. Since the experiments in present study were conducted in a short period and the dataset was relatively limited, prolonged experiment under different operational conditions are needed in future to illustrate the potential long-term effects of disinfection on the microbial community structure. The findings of this study could provide insights into microbial safety concern and control after disinfection for sustainable water reclamation and reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
