The PAH surfaces studied were the 4-ring systems pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, and fluoranthene. Reaction of NO3 radicals with all three PAHs was observed to be very fast with the reactive uptake coefficient, gamma, ranging from 0.059 (+0.11/-0.049) for benz[a]anthracene at 273 K to 0.79 (+0.21/-0.67) for pyrene at room temperature. In contrast to the NO3 reactions, reactions of the different PAHs with the other gas-phase species (N2O5, NO2, HNO3, and O3) were at or below the detection limit (gamma <or= 6.6 x 10(-5)) in all cases, illustrating that these reactions are at best slow. For NO3 we also investigated the time dependence of the reactive uptake to determine if the surface-bound PAH molecules were active participants in the reaction (i.e., reactants). Reaction of NO3 on all three PAH surfaces slowed down at 263 K after long NO3 exposure times, suggesting that the PAH molecules were reactants. Additionally, NO2 and HNO3 were identified as major gas-phase products. Our results show that under certain atmospheric conditions, NO3 radicals can be a more important sink for PAHs than NO2, HNO3, N2O5, or O3 and impact tropospheric lifetimes of surface-bound PAHs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z3."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gross", "ForeName": "Simone", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bertram", "ForeName": "Allan K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "411VRN1TV4", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6XB659ZX2W", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrogen pentoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E0T7WFW93", "NameOfSubstance": "pyrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18311955", "10.1021/jp7107544"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
