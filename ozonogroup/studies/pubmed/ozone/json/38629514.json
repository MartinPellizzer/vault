Clarifying the concentration distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> at different time scales is helpful to formulate scientific and effective pollution prevention and control measures. Here, the concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were decomposed using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on the loess (STL) method; their long-term, seasonal, and short-term components were obtained; and their temporal and spatial distribution characteristics were studied. The results showed that the decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in the BTH Region from 2017 to 2021 was higher than that of O<sub>3</sub>. There was a positive correlation between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in spring and summer and a negative correlation in autumn and winter. The short-term component and seasonal component had the greatest contribution to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, respectively. There were two principal components in the seasonal and short-term components of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the long-term and short-term components of O<sub>3</sub>, corresponding to the central and southern part of Hebei Province and the northern part of the BTH Region. Sub-regional distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the BTH Region at different time scales were found. Compared with that in the original series, the long-term component could better reflect the evolution trend of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, and the standard deviation (SD) of the seasonal component and short-term component could be used to measure the fluctuation in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in various cities. The SD of the seasonal and short-term components of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in every city in front of Taihang Mountain was higher, and the SD of the short-term component of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Tangshan was the highest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Su-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38629514", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202306169"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
