Cerium-doped \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> materials showed ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) conversion of 96% for 40 ppm of O<sub>3</sub> under relative humidity (RH) of 65% and space velocity of 840 L g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> after 6 h at room temperature, which is far superior to the performance of the Co-\u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> (55%) and \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> (38%) catalysts. Under space velocity of 840 L g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, the conversion of ozone over the Ce-\u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst under RH = 65% and dry conditions within 96 h was 60% and 100%, respectively, indicating that it is a promising material for ozone decomposition. XRD and HRTEM data suggested that Ce-\u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> formed mixed crystals consisting of \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> and \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> with specific surface area increased from 74 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 120 m<sup>2</sup>/g compared to undoped \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub>, thus more surface defects were introduced. H<sub>2</sub>-TPR, O<sub>2</sub>-TPD, XPS, Raman, and EXAFS confirmed that Ce-\u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> exhibited more surface oxygen vacancies and surface defects, which play a key role during the decomposition of ozone. This study provides important insights for developing improved catalysts for gaseous ozone decomposition and promoting the performance of manganese oxide for practical ozone elimination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering , Beijing University of Chemical Technology , Beijing 100029 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaotong", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-0669"], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinzhu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering & Technology Research Center for Environmental Protection Materials and Equipment of Jiangxi Province , Pingxiang University , Pingxiang 337055 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1770-3522"], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Guangzhi", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2124-0620"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Changbin", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering , Beijing University of Chemical Technology , Beijing 100029 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Runduo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100085 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Xiamen 361021 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transition Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transition Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30346750", "10.1021/acs.est.8b04294"]}}]}
