Oxidation is one of those methods. There have been only limited data concerning application of the advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) for mustard destruction available before. In this study sulfur mustard oxidation rate depending on kind of the oxidative system and process parameters used was assessed using selected AOT. The following were selected for mustard oxidation: ozone (O(3)), UV light (UV), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)); double systems: UV/O(3), UV/H(2)O(2), and O(3)/H(2)O(2); a triple system: O(3)/H(2)O(2)/UV and Fenton reaction. Effectiveness of the selected AOT methods has been evaluated and the most suitable one for mustard destruction was chosen. Using ozone in various combinations with hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation mustard can be destroyed much quicker comparing to the classical oxidizers. Fast mustard oxidation (a few minutes) occurred in those systems where ozone alone was used, or in the following combinations: O(3)/H(2)O(2), O(3)/UV and O(3)/H(2)O(2)/UV. When those advanced oxidation technologies are used, mustard becomes destroyed mainly in course of the direct oxidation with ozone, and reactions of mustard with radicals formed due to ozone action play a secondary role. Rate of sulfur mustard oxidation in the above mentioned ozone-containing oxidative systems decreases with pH value increasing from 2 to 12. Only when pH value of reaction solutions is close to pH 5, mustard oxidation rate is minimal, probably due to \"disappearance\" of radicals participating in oxidation in this pH. Sulfur mustard can be most effectively destroyed using just ozone in pH 7. In that case mustard destruction rate is only slightly lower than the rate achieved in optimal conditions, and the system is the simplest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland. spopiel@wat.edu.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Popiel", "ForeName": "Stanis\u0142aw", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witkiewicz", "ForeName": "Zygfryd", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chrzanowski", "ForeName": "Micha\u0142", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemical Warfare Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T8KEC9FH9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Mustard Gas"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Warfare Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17913350", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.08.041", "S0304-3894(07)01171-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
