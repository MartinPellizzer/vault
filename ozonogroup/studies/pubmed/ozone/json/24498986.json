Here, we investigate the effects of elevated O\u2083 on microbial biomass and community structure in the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with different O\u2083 sensitivity (R123: O\u2083-tolerant plant; S156: O\u2083-sensitive plant) based on the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) method. Compared with ambient O\u2083, elevated O\u2083 significantly decreased mycorrhizal colonization rates in the 2 genotypes, especially in S156 plants. The wet masses of shoot and root were decreased by elevated O\u2083 in the 2 genotypes independent of AM inoculation, but they were higher in the mycorrhizal plant than in the nonmycorrhizal plant independent of O\u2083 concentration. Elevated O\u2083 significantly decreased the relative proportion of specific fungal PLFAs in the nonmycorrhizal plant, but this effect disappeared in the mycorrhizal plant. The relative proportions of specific PLFAs of other microbial groups (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and actinomycete) in the rhizosphere and all specific PLFAs in the hyphosphere were not affected by elevated O\u2083 independent of AM inoculation. In the rhizosphere of the 2 genotypes, microbial community structure was changed by AM inoculation and elevated O\u2083 as well as by their interaction; in the hyphosphere, however, microbial community structure was changed by elevated O\u2083 only in R123 plants. It is concluded that AM inoculation can offset negative effect of elevated O\u2083 on fungal biomass but seems to enhance shift of microbial community structure in rhizosphere under elevated O\u2083."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Engineering and Science, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuguang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diao", "ForeName": "Xiaojun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Liansheng", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phaseolus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizosphere"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24498986", "10.1139/cjm-2013-0851"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
