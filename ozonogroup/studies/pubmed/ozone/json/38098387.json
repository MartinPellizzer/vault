Detection and source localization of atmospheric pollutants is the basis and key to controlling the combined pollution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. With the rapid development of UAV technology and sensor technology, air pollution detection based on UAV platforms can effectively obtain the structural characteristics of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> near the surface and accurately trace the source of air pollution events by applying the computer algorithms, with the characteristics of high timeliness, flexibility, and spatial and temporal resolution. This will help researchers understand the distribution, changes, and sources of regional pollutants and provide a scientific basis for the synergistic control of combined air pollution. This study reviewed the traditional air pollution detection methods, summarized the types of UAV platforms and detection instruments commonly used in pollution detection, concluded the applications of UAV-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution detection and the algorithms of pollution source localization, and discussed the future trends of UAV-based air pollution detection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Intelligent Science and Control Engineering, Jinling Institute of Technology, Nanjing 211169, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster(KLME), Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters(CIC-FEMD), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ti-Jian", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster(KLME), Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters(CIC-FEMD), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Transportation Meteorology of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing Joint Institute for Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing 210041, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38098387", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202211243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
