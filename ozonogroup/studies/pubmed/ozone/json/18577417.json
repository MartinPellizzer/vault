Accordingly, the present study was designed to assess the effects of oxygen-ozone on astrocytes. Astrocytes were cultured in vitro through methods of trypsinization, different-speed cultivation and passaging to purify, then seeded into 24 well plates and divided to one of four groups (n=7) to receive the following treatments: respectively added 400 microl complete medium (CM) after effects of 20 microg/ml oxygen-ozone (Group O-20), 40 microg/ml oxygen-ozone (Group O-40), 60 microg/ml oxygen-ozone (Group O-60); without intervention (Group C). After incubation of 2 h or 4 h, cell morphology was observed and endocellular superoxide dismutase (SOD), endocellular malondialdehyde (MDA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leaking ratio, and dead cells' percentage were detected. The results showed cell damage in Group O-60. As compared with Group C, endocellular SOD increased in all groups, MDA at 2 h increased in Groups O-40 and O-60 and MDA at 4 h decreased in Groups O-20 and O-40; LDH leaking ratio at 2 h in Group O-20 and those at 2 and 4 h in Group O-40 decreased, while LDH leaking ratio at 4 h increased and dead cells' percentage in Group O-60 increased. We conclude that in short time (2 and 4 h), oxygen-ozone of 60 microg/ml showed a damaging role on astrocytes in vitro, while oxygen-ozone of 20 and 40 microg/ml did not show damaging role obviously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Management, Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Nai-bao", "Initials": "NB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Zhi-jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Neurosci Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600130", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3940"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Astrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18577417", "10.1016/j.neulet.2008.06.036", "S0304-3940(08)00811-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
