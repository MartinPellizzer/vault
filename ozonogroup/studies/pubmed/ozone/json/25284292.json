This study investigated O3 and O3/H2O2 systems to pretreat hydrocortisone wastewater. The optimum treatment efficiency of the O3 system was achieved under pH value of 5.76, dosage of O3 of 217.5\u2005mg/L, and reaction time of 90\u2005min. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) was 94% and 92%, respectively. The ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and COD (B/C) increased from 0.066 to 0.310. Moreover, the optimum H2O2/O3 molar ratio was 0.3 with the optimum pH of 3, and reaction time was reduced to 15\u2005min to reach COD removal efficiency of 67.3% in the O3/H2O2 oxidation system. Interestingly, isobutanol was assumed to be a good hydroxyl radical trapping agent due to the great decrease of Fenton reagent reaction rate constant. By comparing two different kinetic models, oxidation mechanism could be interpreted by the pseudo first-order kinetic model with the high correlation coefficient R2 above 0.9787. It can be concluded that ozonation system was controlled by both direct oxidation and free radical oxidation, and particularly the later one played a dominant role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Science and Engineering , College of Marine Science and Engineering, Tianjin University of Science &Technology , Tianjin 300457 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guiju", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dandan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Panpan", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WI4X0X7BPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocortisone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25284292", "10.1080/09593330.2014.971885"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
