In this study, we found that propane and n-butane were significantly lower at the offshore site (WSI) in Hong Kong ( p < 0.05), whereas C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> were comparable to the suburban site (TC) ( p > 0.05). Stronger oxidative capacity at WSI led to more efficient RONO<sub>2</sub> formation. Relative incremental reactivity (RIR) was for the first time used to evaluate RONO<sub>2</sub>-precursor relationships. In contrast to a consistently volatile organic compounds (VOC)-limited regime at TC, RONO<sub>2</sub> formation at WSI switched from VOC-limited regime during O<sub>3</sub> episodes to VOC and nitrogen oxides (NO <sub>x</sub>) colimited regime during nonepisodes. Furthermore, unlike the predominant contributions of parent hydrocarbons to C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub>, the production of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> RONO<sub>2</sub> was more sensitive to other VOCs like aromatics and carbonyls, which accounted for \u223c40-90% of the productions of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> alkylperoxy (RO<sub>2</sub>) and alkoxy radicals (RO) at both sites. This resulted from the decomposition of larger RO<sub>2</sub>/RO and the change of OH abundance under the photochemistry of other VOCs. This study advanced our understanding of the photochemical formation of RONO<sub>2</sub>, particularly the relationships between RONO<sub>2</sub> and their precursors, which were not confined to the parent hydrocarbons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Lewei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Xiaopu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7996-7294"], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Shichun", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Zhenhao", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29664616", "10.1021/acs.est.8b00256"]}}]}
