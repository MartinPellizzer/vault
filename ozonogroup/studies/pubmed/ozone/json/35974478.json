This study investigated the role of two plant growth regulators in affecting wheat-yield responses to elevated [O<sub>3</sub> ]. In a controlled factorial experiment, wheat plants were treated with combinations of Ethephon, which releases ethene, Chlormequat, which blocks gibberellin synthesis, and elevated [O<sub>3</sub> ]. \u2022 \u2002 Spring-wheat plants were subjected to lifelong exposures to ambient or moderately elevated [O<sub>3</sub> ]. At flag-leaf emergence, the plants were treated with Ethephon and/or Chlormequat, or untreated (controls). Gas-exchange measurements were made at anthesis; morphology, biomass, and yield components were recorded at harvest. \u2022 \u2002 Elevated [O<sub>3</sub> ] accelerated development and decreased the number of grains per ear and ears per plant. Chlormequat abolished these O<sub>3</sub> effects, protecting against yield reduction though not biomass loss. Ethephon treatment partially protected against O<sub>3</sub> -induced biomass loss though not yield reduction. \u2022 \u2002 This study suggests that the effects of elevated [O<sub>3</sub> ] on development and allocation are more important in determining the yield response of wheat than the accompanying decline in photosynthesis and biomass accumulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, John Tabor Laboratories, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, Essex, CO4 3SQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKee", "ForeName": "I F", "Initials": "IF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Illinois, Departments of Crop Sciences and Plant Biology, 190 Edward R.
