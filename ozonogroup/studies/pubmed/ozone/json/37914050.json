Its catalytic capability in photocatalytic ozonation process was tested by degradation and mineralization of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) solution. The results demonstrated that the TOC removal rate was dramatically improved to 90.0% at 75\u00a0min for UV/O<sub>3</sub>/BiPO<sub>4</sub> process, which was 4.9 and 3.8 times more than that of UV/BiPO<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant (0.337 min<sup>-1</sup>) and mineralization rate (90.0%) for SDBS degradation using BiPO<sub>4</sub> in UV/O<sub>3</sub> process were 1.6 and 1.3 times as great as that of conventional TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst (0.206 min<sup>-1</sup>, 67.3%). The influence of BiPO<sub>4</sub> dosage, O<sub>3</sub> concentration initial pH and coexisted ions on SDBS degradation in UV/O<sub>3</sub>/BiPO<sub>4</sub> process were also investigated. The outcome of quenching studies illustrated both \u00b7OH and h<sup>+</sup> contributed prominently to SDBS degradation in UV/O<sub>3</sub>/BiPO<sub>4</sub> process, implying that high valence band position of BiPO<sub>4</sub> could promote the synergism between photocatalysis and ozonation. The degradation pathway of SBDS was proposed by combination of intermediates analysis and DFT calculation. Real carwash wastewater was chosen as typical surfactant containing wastewater to explore the practical application of UV/O<sub>3</sub>/BiPO<sub>4</sub> technology. During 30\u00a0min, COD and LAS removal efficiency reached 59.7% and 70.6%, respectively. The quality indices of effluent could meet the requirements for reuse of carwash water in Water Quality Standard for Urban Miscellaneous Use in China. Energy consumption in the process was calculated as 13.9\u00a0kW\u00a0h m<sup>-3</sup>, which was about 3.6 and 2.2 times less than that of UV/BiPO<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> process, respectively. The results suggest that UV/O<sub>3</sub>/BiPO<sub>4</sub> system has an application potential for surfactant containing wastewater treatment or recycle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
