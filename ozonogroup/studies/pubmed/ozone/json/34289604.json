Specifically, we prepared functional Mn-C@Fe nanoparticles with carbon shell supporting Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for catalysis while encapsulating magnetic iron core for recycle. Batch study shows its excellent catalytic reactivity on the degradation of organics particular for the ozone-recalcitrant oxalic acid (20\u00a0min for 90.9% removal, kinetics constant of 0.045 min<sup>-1</sup>). Our mechanism study ruled out the hydroxyl radical oxidation, and highlighted the formation of a heptavalent Mn intermediate oxidant responsible for the fast degradation that was initiated via ozone activation of Mn(II)-sites on the carbon shell. Our findings underscore a non-radical catalytic ozonation as a promising alternative technology for the abatement of aqueous organic pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
