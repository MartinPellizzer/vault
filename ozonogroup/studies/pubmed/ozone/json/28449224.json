OMI data at solar noon were compared to ground-based spectral irradiances at Toowoomba (27\u00b036' S 151\u00b055' E), Australia, at 310, 324 and 380 nm for both cloud-free and all sky conditions. There was a strong relationship between the ground-based UV spectroradiometer data and satellite-based measurements with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.89 or better in each waveband for cloud-free days. The data show an overestimate of the satellite-derived spectral irradiances compared to the ground-based data. The models developed for the subtropical site data account for this overestimation and are essential for any data correlation between satellite- and ground-based measurements. Additionally, this research has compared solar noon broadband UVA irradiances evaluated with a model and the discrete satellite spectral irradiances for the solar noon values of cloud-free days to those measured with a ground-based UVA radiometer. An R<sup>2</sup> of 0.86 was obtained confirming that for cloud-free days the broadband UVA can be evaluated from the OMI satellite spectral irradiances."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The American Society of Photobiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia."}], "LastName": "A Jebar", "ForeName": "Mustapha A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia."}], "LastName": "Parisi", "ForeName": "Alfio V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia."}], "LastName": "Downs", "ForeName": "Nathan J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, Engineering and Sciences, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia."}], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "Joanna F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28449224", "10.1111/php.12784"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
