In this paper, the reaction process of ozone-initiated KET degradation in water was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) method at the M06-2X/6-311++g(3df,2p)//M06-2X/6-31+g(d,p) level. The detailed reaction path of KET ozonation is proposed. The thermodynamic results show that ozone-initiated KET degradation is feasible. Under ultraviolet irradiation, the reaction of ozone with water can also produce OH radicals (HO<sup>\u00b7</sup>) that can react with KET. The degradation reaction of KET caused by HO<sup>\u00b7</sup> was further studied. The kinetic calculation illustrates that the reaction rate (1.99 \u00d7 10<sup>-1</sup> (mol/L)<sup>-1</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>) of KET ozonation is relatively slow, but the reaction rate of HO<sup>\u00b7</sup> reaction is relatively high, which can further improve the degradation efficiency. On this basis, the effects of pollutant concentration, ozone concentration, natural organic matter, and pH value on degradation efficiency under UV/O<sub>3</sub> process were analyzed. The ozonolysis reaction of KET is not sensitive to pH and is basically unaffected. Finally, the toxicity prediction of oxidation compounds produced by degradation reaction indicates that most of the degradation products are harmless, and a few products containing benzene rings are still toxic and have to be concerned. This study serves as a theoretical basis for analyzing the migration and transformation process of anti-inflammatory compounds in the water environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
