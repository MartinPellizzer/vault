A significant effect of ozone exposure on microbial inactivation was observed. After ozonation, minor effects on the cell membrane integrity and permeability were observed, while scanning electron microscopy analysis showed slightly altered cell surface structure.", "The results of this study suggest that cell lysis was not the major mechanism of microbial inactivation. The deletion of oxidative stress-related genes resulted in increased susceptibility of E. coli cells to ozone treatment, implying that they play an important role for protection against the radicals produced by ozone. However, DnaK that has previously been shown to protect against oxidative stress did not protect against ozone treatment in this study. Furthermore, RpoS was important for the survival against ozone.", "This study provides important information about the role of oxidative stress in the responses of E. coli during ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 The Authors.
