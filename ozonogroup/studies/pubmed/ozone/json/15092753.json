At time intervals ranging from 1 h to 42 days after treatment, macroautoradiographs of leaf, stem and root tissue were made to determine relative distribution patterns of labelled chemical. Translocation of (14)C-EDU was very rapid and predominantly acropetal, especially after the first few hours. Maximum quantities of (14)C were found in leaf tissue approximately 7-10 days following injection, after which the intensity of the labelled chemical declined over the remainder of the study (42 days). Distribution patterns of (14)C-EDU were correlated with observed levels of protection afforded most plants when the chemical is injected 7 days before fumigation with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, OH 43015, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roberts", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cascino", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092753", "10.1016/0269-7491(87)90050-9", "0269749187900509"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
