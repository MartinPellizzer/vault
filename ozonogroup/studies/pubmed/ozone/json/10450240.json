London data from 1992 to 1994 were analysed to examine the consistency of results over time and to include particles with a mean aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns (PM10) and carbon monoxide.", "Poisson regression was used of daily mortality counts grouped by age and diagnosis, adjusting for trend, seasonality, calendar effects, deaths from influenza, meteorology, and serial correlation. The pollutants examined were particles (PM10 and black smoke), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide with single and cumulative lags up to 3 days.", "No significant associations were found between any pollutant and all cause mortality, but, with the exception of ozone, all estimates were positive. Each pollutant apart from ozone was significantly associated with respiratory mortality; PM10 showed the largest effect (4% increase in deaths of all ages for a 10th-90th percentile increment). The pollutants significantly associated with cardiovascular deaths were nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and black smoke but there was no evidence of an association with PM10. In two pollutant models of respiratory deaths, the effect of black smoke, which in London indicates fine particles of diesel origin, was independent of that of PM10, but not vice versa.", "These results from a new data set confirm a previous report that there are associations between various air pollutants and daily mortality in London. This new study found greater specificity for associations with respiratory and cardiovascular deaths, and this increases the plausibility of a causal explanation. However, the effects of ozone found in the earlier study were not replicated. The fraction of PM10 which comprises black smoke accounted for much of the effect of PM10."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, St George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bremner", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atkinson", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McMichael", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strachan", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bland", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bower", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poisson Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Stat Med. 1989 May;8(5):551-61", "ArticleIdList": ["2657958"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1995 Mar;103 Suppl 2:3-13", "ArticleIdList": ["7614944"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1995 May;103(5):472-80", "ArticleIdList": ["7656877"]}, {"Citation": "Epidemiology. 1995 Sep;6(5):476-84", "ArticleIdList": ["8562622"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1996 Mar 16;312(7032):665-9", "ArticleIdList": ["8597732"]}, {"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996 Apr;50 Suppl 1:S3-11", "ArticleIdList": ["8758217"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Nov 1;146(9):750-62", "ArticleIdList": ["9366623"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1996 Aug;104(8):838-50", "ArticleIdList": ["8875158"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1996 Oct;46(10):927-39", "ArticleIdList": ["8875828"]}, {"Citation": "Occup Environ Med. 1997 Feb;54(2):108-16", "ArticleIdList": ["9072018"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1997 Jun 7;314(7095):1658-63", "ArticleIdList": ["9180068"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Jul 15;146(2):177-85", "ArticleIdList": ["9230780"]}, {"Citation": "J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996 Apr;50 Suppl 1:S12-8", "ArticleIdList": ["8758218"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10450240", "PMC1757726", "10.1136/oem.56.4.237"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
