These radicals can affect ozone production and destruction in the stratosphere. Recently, it became clear that halogen radicals can also play a significant role in the chemistry of the troposphere. The photochemistry of ClNO(2) has been the subject of several studies in the gas and solid state that demonstrated a clear phase-dependent reactivity. Here, we report our initial studies of nitryl chloride in solution. Resonance Raman (RR) spectra of ClNO(2) dissolved in methanol after excitation within the 1(1)A(1)-2(1)A(1) absorption band (D band) in the region 200-240 nm are presented. RR intensity along the NO symmetric stretch coordinate (v(1)) at 1291 cm(-1) is observed at all excitation wavelengths, whereas limited intensity corresponding to the transition of the N-Cl symmetric stretch (v(3)) was only observed at 199.8 nm, whereas no intensity corresponding to the O-N-O symmetric bend (v(2)) was observed. Depolarization ratios and absolute resonance Raman cross sections for v(1) were obtained at several excitation wavelengths spanning the D band. Depolarization ratios were found to deviate significantly from 1/3, consistent with more than a single dipole-allowed electronic transition contributing to the scattering. RR intensity analysis (RRIA) reveals that two closely spaced excited electronic states contribute to the scattering, which are dissociative along the Cl-N coordinate. In this study the role the solvent environment plays in ClNO(2) state energetics and excited structural evolution along fundamental coordinates is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cyprus, P.O.
