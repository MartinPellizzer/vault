The soldiers, who were randomly distributed among military units throughout the country, led homogenous lives and were subjected to health checkups 8-12\u00a0months post-enlistment. We analyzed data pertaining to those who enlisted and underwent health checkups in 2019 (n\u00a0=\u00a012,778) using linear mixed models. Additionally, we evaluated quantile-specific associations using quantile regression models. We also assessed interactions based on body mass index (BMI) at the time of enlistment (\u226525.0 vs.\u00a0<\u00a025.0\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>).", "The linear mixed models revealed that a 10-\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in fine particulate matter\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by -0.66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.21, -0.10), and a 10-ppb increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) increased total cholesterol (TC) levels by 1.04% (95% CI: 0.24, 1.84). In the quantile regression models, associations were also found at specific deciles. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure contributed to higher TC, NO<sub>2</sub> resulted in higher triglycerides and lower HDL-C, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) led to lower HDL-C. The association between O<sub>3</sub> and TC differed according to BMI (p-value for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.03); among those with a BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025.0\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a 10-ppb increase in O<sub>3</sub> increased TC by 1.09% (95% CI: 0.20, 1.09).", "These results shed new light on the importance of controlling air pollution, which can contribute to abnormal blood lipid levels, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
