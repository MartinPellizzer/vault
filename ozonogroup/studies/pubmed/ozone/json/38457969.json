While ceramide metabolism plays an important role in IR pathogenesis, the effects of air pollution on this process and its mechanisms remain unclear. We recruited young adults aged 18-30 years to a panel study in Wuhan, China. Using personal portable devices and stationary monitoring stations, we tracked particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters\u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics quantified ceramide metabolism, and Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850 kBeadChip assay measured deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation. Linear mixed-effects models assessed relationships of air pollution with i) IR indexes, ii) ceramide metabolism, and iii) DNA methylation. Mediation analysis was subsequently performed to evaluate the potential mediating effect of DNA methylation in the association between air pollution and ceramide metabolism. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were associated with elevated IR. Specifically, each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> at lag0-12\u00a0h significantly increased triglyceride\u2011glucose index (TyG index) and TyG-BMI (TyG - Body mass index) by 0.88%, 0.89% and 0.26%, 0.26%, respectively. Furthermore, levels of eight ceramides were altered by air pollution exposure, and nine methylated CpG sites in inflammation genes mediated the effects of air pollution on ceramide metabolism. Our findings imply the existence of a novel mechanism connecting air pollution to IR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
