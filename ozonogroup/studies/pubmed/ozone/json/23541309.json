The parent compound was almost completely degraded with ozone dose up to 3.5 mg/L with no mineralization. Twenty one degradation products were identified using an electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Several ozonation pathways were proposed including hydroxylation, demethylation, carbonylation, deamination and methylene group cleavage. Two species of luminescent bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum and Vibrio qinghaiensis were selected to assess the toxicity of ozonation products. For P. phosphoreum, higher level of toxicity was observed compared to the parent compound, but a negligible toxicity change was observed for V. qinghaiensis, indicating different modes of action for the same water sample. This was further confirmed by quantitative structure-active relationship analysis. This work proves the dominant role of ozone rather than hydroxyl radicals in the reaction and the potential risk after ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
