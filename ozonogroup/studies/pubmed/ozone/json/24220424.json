A total of 30 Wistar male rats were used. A 5-mm-diameter trephine bur was used to create CSD on the right side of the parietal bone of each rat calvarium. Once the bone was excised, a synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate graft material was implanted to all the bone defect sites. The animals were randomly divided into 3 groups as follows: the control group (n = 10), which received no LLLT or ozone therapy; the LLLT group (n = 10), which received only LLLT (120 seconds, 3 times a week for 2 weeks); and the ozone therapy group (n = 10) (120 seconds, 3 times a week for 2 weeks). After 1 month, all the rats were killed, and the sections were examined to evaluate the presence of inflammatory infiltrate, connective tissue, and new bone formation areas. Histomorphometric analyses showed that in the LLLT and ozone groups, the new bone areas were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). In the LLLT group, higher new bone areas were found than in the ozone group (P < 0.05). This study demonstrated that both ozone and laser therapies had a positive effect on bone formation in rat calvarial defect, compared with the control group; however, ozone therapy was more effective than LLLT (808 nm; 0.1 W; 4 J/cm(2); 0.028 cm(2), continuous wave mode)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "From the *Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry; and \u2020Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kazancioglu", "ForeName": "Hakki Oguz", "Initials": "HO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ezirganli", "ForeName": "Seref", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aydin", "ForeName": "Mehmet Serif", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Craniofac Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "9010410", "ISSNLinking": "1049-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Substitutes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Substitutes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Low-Level Light Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Parietal Bone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skull Fractures"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24220424", "10.1097/SCS.0b013e3182a244ae", "00001665-201311000-00061"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
