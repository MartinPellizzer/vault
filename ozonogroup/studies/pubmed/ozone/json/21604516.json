In addition, the article emphatically introduces the ozone's applications and development in the medical aspects. Prospects for the use of ozone concentration detection, ozone treatment and ozone therapy instrument are also demonstrated in it. The literature collected and reviewed on ozone concentration detection and ozone therapy includes 37 papers in English, and 50 papers in Chinese, but only 30 articles among them are included in this review (19 in Chinese and 11 in English), according to the principle of eliminating the old information and repetitive contents. The present paper selects only those on ozone, ozone concentration, ozone therapy and ozone therapy instrument."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Yanshan University, Q inhuangdao 066004, China. hljin@ysu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Hailong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Shaoyan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Junjie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Wenxue", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9426398", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5515"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21604516"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
