UVO irradiation of copper-doped nickel acetate significantly increased the electrical conductivity (from 4.28 \u00d7 10(-4) S cm(-1) to 5.66 \u00d7 10(-2) S cm(-1)), which is due to the increased carrier concentration (from 3.53 \u00d7 10(13) cm(-3) to 2.41 \u00d7 10(16) cm(-3)), and the charge extraction efficiency was enhanced, leading to better compatibility with the hole transport layer. By UVO irradiation, the work function was increased from 4.95 eV to 5.33 eV by the surface dipole formation, which effectively reduced the interface barrier between the hole transport layer and the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer. UVO Irradiation of the underlying layer also allows the MAPbI3 precursors to form better morphology with highly arranged crystallinity. Compared to the cells using non-irradiated copper doped nickel acetate, UVO-irradiated copper-doped nickel acetate devices showed an enhanced open-circuit voltage (3% increase), short circuit current (16% increase), fill factor (5% increase), showing an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 12.2% (21% increase)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeongmo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hee Ryung", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyeong Pil", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Tengda", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kanwat", "ForeName": "Anil", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Mohd Yusoff", "ForeName": "Abd Rashid Bin", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Display Research Center, Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemoon-goo, 130-701 Seoul, Korea. jjang@khu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanoscale", "NlmUniqueID": "101525249", "ISSNLinking": "2040-3364"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27088187", "10.1039/c6nr01308b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
