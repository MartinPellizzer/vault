However, these studies were conducted on a small scale, which limits their application to LMF industries. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gaseous antimicrobial intervention with ClO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> to reduce foodborne pathogens (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, serovars of Salmonella enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes) inoculated on almonds and peppercorns maintained under various conditions. Almonds were treated for over 4 or 6\u00a0h. Peppercorns were treated for over 2.5 or 4\u00a0h. Gaseous O<sub>3</sub> treatment was used for 6\u00a0h on almonds and 2 or 4\u00a0h on peppercorns. Additionally, the effects of relative humidity (RH) during the treatment of peppercorns and post-treatment heating on almonds were evaluated. Heating at 65\u00a0\u00b0C post-ClO<sub>2</sub> treatment yielded the highest bacterial log reduction of 4.6\u00a0CFU/g on almonds, while 80% RH resulted in 3.7-log bacterial reduction on peppercorns. Gaseous O<sub>3</sub> resulted in maximum log reductions of 1.3 and 2.5\u00a0CFU/g on almonds and peppercorns, respectively. No visual damage was observed. In conclusion, ClO<sub>2</sub> was more efficient than O<sub>3</sub> and the treatment can be incorporated into industrial practices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Produce Safety and Microbiology Research Unit, Western Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service.
