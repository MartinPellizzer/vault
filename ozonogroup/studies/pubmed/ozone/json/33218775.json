The comparison shows that the clean and static boundary conditions, referred to as PROFILE, apparently underestimate the ozone concentration over the upper troposphere and stratosphere, whereas the global chemical transport model (CTM) provides much more reasonable performance. Further investigation reveals that the boundary conditions exert larger impacts over areas with high altitudes and close distances to boundaries, such as the Tibetan Plateau, while they yield weak impacts on regions relatively far from the boundary, such as the North China Plain (NCP). Process analysis was conducted to investigate the modulation of physical and chemical processes on ozone formation in June 2017, illustrating that during the daytime of the high-O<sub>3</sub> period, the photochemical reactions within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) almost become the only source favorable to ozone accumulation. Motivated by this phenomenon, we constructed a linear regression and found that the maximum daily 8-hr ozone (MDA8) ozone concentration was highly correlated with the surface ozone change rate and chemical reactions in the PBL during the pollution period, with MDA8 ozone exceeding 70\u00a0ppbv over NCP. Based on this relationship as well as the design of numerical experiments, we propose a strategy of dynamic emission control. Firstly, the emission reduction during the peak ozone formation period may weaken the fast chemical reactions in the PBL and subsequent surface ozone concentration. Secondly, emission reduction one or two days prior to an episode might achieve larger ozone reduction through the accumulation effect. Lastly, emission control outside of the NCP may surpass the local impact under favorable meteorological conditions. Therefore, the efficacy of dynamic emission control was striking when both the accumulation and transport effect were taken into consideration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
