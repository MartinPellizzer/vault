Exogenous l-arginine improves endothelial function to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease, but the mechanism by which this is accomplished remains unclear. We determined the effects of exogenous l-arginine infusion on vascular biomarkers in patients with hypertension.", "Venous blood samples were obtained from seven patients with hypertension (45\u00b15yrs., HT group) and eleven normotensive men (37\u00b13yrs., CT group) before and during a 30-min intravenous l-arginine or saline infusion. Nitrite concentration was evaluated by ozone-chemiluminescence method; metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activities were detected by zymography; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and 8-isoprostane concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were determined by colorimetric assay.", "At baseline, nitrite, TIMP-1, and MMP-2 activity were similar between the groups (P>0.05), but MMP-9, TBARS and 8-isoprostane were higher in HT group (P\u22640.03). During l-arginine infusion, nitrite increased only in control group (P=0.01), while MMP-2, MMP-9 activities, MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio and 8-isoprostane decreased in HT group (P\u22640.02). There were no significant changes in vascular biomarkers between groups during the saline infusion (P>0.05).", "Exogenous l-arginine diminished metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activities and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio along with restoring the oxidative stress balance in patients with hypertension."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
