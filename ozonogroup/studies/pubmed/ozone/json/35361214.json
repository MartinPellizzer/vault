Our aims were to estimate the prevalence of O<sub>2</sub> desaturation during exercise in patients with COPD, and determine the association of exposure to air pollution with exercise-induced desaturation (EID), the degree of emphysema, and dynamic hyperinflation (DH).", "We assessed the effects of 10-year prior to the HRCT assessment and 7\u00a0days prior to the six-minute walking test exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of\u2009<\u200910\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>) or of\u2009<\u20092.5\u00a0\u00b5M (PM<sub>2.5)</sub>, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in patients with emphysema in this retrospective cohort study.

Ambient air pollutant (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>) data were obtained from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) air-monitoring stations, usually within 10\u00a0km to each participant's home address.", "We recruited 141 subjects with emphysema. 41.1% of patients with emphysema exhibited EID, and patients with EID had more dyspnea, worse lung function, more severe emphysema, more frequent acute exacerbations, managed a shorter walking distance, had DH, and greater long-term exposure to air pollution than those without EID. We observed that levels of 10-year concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> were significantly associated with EID, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were associated with the severity of emphysema, and associated with DH in patients with emphysema.
