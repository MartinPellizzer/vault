Enhancing the stability of the sulfur-doped graphene structure is therefore important to improve its catalytic activity during the ozonation process. However, this has remained a challenge so far. Therefore, we adopted a low-energy microwave plasma technique to synthesize a high purity sulfur-doped graphene (S \u23af Gr) catalyst for the ozonation process. The effect of S \u23af Gr in the ozonation process was tested using carbamazepine (CBZ; 0.05 mM) as a probe compound. A complete CBZ removal was obtained at an ozone concentration of 0.08 mM while in comparison with single O<sub>3</sub>, \u223c1.5 and 2.5 times decrease in the formation of the two important intermediate transformation products i.e., BQM (1-(2-benzaldehyde) - 4-hydroxy (1H, 3H)-quinazoline-2-one) and BQD (1-(2-benzaldehyde) - (1H, 3H)-quinazoline-2, 4-dione) was observed. Radical scavenging experiments confirmed the formation of HO. The XPS results showed that the activity of S \u23af Gr towards the formation of HO was positively related to S-bearing carbon atoms at the edge of the graphene structure. Therefore, the addition of S \u23af Gr is directly linked with the formation of HO, which further contributed to the improved elimination of intermediate transformation products. With a low sulfur loss of 1 %, the microwave plasma synthesized S \u23af Gr catalyst remained stable during ozonation, implying its feasibility in practical application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
