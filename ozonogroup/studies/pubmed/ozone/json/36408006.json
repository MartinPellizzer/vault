However, few studies were conducted in Egypt; thus, the researchers conducted the current cross-sectional study among a sample of the Egyptian population to identify general knowledge and perception about climate change and its effects, as well as attitudes toward mitigation measures.", "An exploratory population-based electronic-open survey, was conducted among 527 members of the general population between January and April 2022, using a convenience sampling technique. A pre-tested 2-page (screen) electronic included three sections: sociodemographic characteristics, global warming/climate change-related knowledge, and attitude toward climate change mitigation.", "The average global warming knowledge score was 12 \u00b1 3. More than 70% (71.1%) of the participants were knowledgeable (percentage score >70%). Approximately half of the enrolled participants (48.2%) agreed that everyone is vulnerable to the effects of global warming/climate change. More than three-quarters (78.3%) of the participants agreed that carbon emissions from vehicles and industrial methane emissions were the first factors that contributed to climate change, followed by the ozone holes (731%). Global warming/climate change-related knowledge was statistically higher in participants aged of >30 years, married participants, urban residents, highly educated individuals, and employed individuals (<i>p</i>-value \u2264 0.05). Approximately 80% of the participants agreed that responding to the questionnaire drew their attention to the topic of climate change and its effects. More than two-thirds of those polled agreed that increasing public transportation use could help mitigate the effects of climate change/global warming, followed by the materials used and the direction of construction.", "More than two-thirds of the participants were knowledgeable regarding climate change. Social media and the internet were the main sources of information. However, participants need to get the information in a different way that could help in changing their attitude positively toward the issue of climate change mitigation. The current study recommends the need for various initiatives that work should be launched."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Salem, Hegazy, Thabet Mohammed, Mahrous Hassan, Saad Abdou and Zein."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Manial, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Salem", "ForeName": "Marwa Rashad", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Helwan University, Helwan, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hegazy", "ForeName": "Nelly", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Thabet Mohammed", "ForeName": "Anas Abdullnasser", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, El Menia University, Minya, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mahrous Hassan", "ForeName": "Esraa", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Emergency Resident, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Saad Abdou", "ForeName": "Mohamed Mohyeldin", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Manial, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Zein", "ForeName": "Marwa M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101616579", "ISSNLinking": "2296-2565"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Johnston RB.
