We tested the robustness of the associations using two-pollutant models and examined the potential effect modification by age, gender and season via stratification analyses. Lastly, we fitted the concentration-response curves.", "We identified a total of 4761 AECOPD inpatients during the study period. The average daily-mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was 45.2\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration on the concurrent day of the onset of AECOPD was associated with a 1.05% (95% confidence interval: 0.14%, 1.96%) increase in AECOPD. The association was robust to the adjustment of ozone, but not to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The association was larger in females, elderly patients, and was restricted within the cold season, but all between-group differences were insignificant. The concentration-response relationship curves were generally linear but flatted at concentrations over 40\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>.", "This study demonstrated a higher risk of AECOPD associated with present-day PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure in a Chinese city.
