We focused on two ozone episodes, September 6th-September 11th (\"Episode 1\") and September 23rd-September 26th (\"Episode 2\"), when the maximum daily eight-hour average (MDA8) ozone at surface monitors exceeded 70 ppbv. Long-range transport patterns of air masses during these episodes were from the central/northern US. High-resolution (4\u00a0km resolution) trajectory analysis with FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model revealed local recirculation of air masses and the accumulation of pollutants across Houston contribute to the ozone exceedances. Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) driven by 1.33-km resolution meteorology from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) tool simulated elevated ozone production rates during ozone episodes across the Houston metropolitan area, with ozone production hotspots mostly over Houston city and industrial districts of the Houston Ship Channel (HSC). The regional increase in ozone production rates was due to the transport of VOC-rich air masses (via northerly flows) that brought ozone precursors to the region, which ultimately caused a transition in the ozone formation tendency from generally VOC-limited to NO<sub>x</sub>-limited conditions. However, the city of Houston and the HSC remained in a VOC-limited regime because of local NO<sub>x</sub> emissions that, to some extent, preponderated the impact of transported VOCs. While approximately 37\u00a0% of the elevated ozone production was attributed to local photochemistry, the remaining \u223c63\u00a0% increase in ozone production was due to the transported ozone to the region during episodes, bringing ozone to the Houston region and contributing to ozone exceedances. The outcomes of this study illustrated the synergy between transport and ozone production, both long-range and local scale, which resulted in ozone exceedances in Houston."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
