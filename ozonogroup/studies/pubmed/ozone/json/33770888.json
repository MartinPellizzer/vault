Given that PM<sub>2.5</sub> is still controlled as a key pollutant, managements for the collaborative reduction of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are urgently required in China. In the current work, monitoring data of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> from 2015 to 2016 in 1464 monitoring sites (MS) was collected and cleaned. Additionally, 7 anthropogenic emission reductions were jointed with the corresponding monitoring data. According to the O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> variation, a meta-analysis was conducted and divided regions into 4 categories via the effect size, region I: O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> collaborative reduction, region II: PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased and O<sub>3</sub> increased, region III: O<sub>3</sub> decreased and PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased, regions IV: both O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased. Then, based on the region labels, machine learning was used to identify the pattern between region label and its precursor reductions. The findings were as follows: (1) Principal component analysis showed that NH<sub>3</sub> was not focused on. (2) Random forest had a well performance on region classification with the accuracy of 80.40% and the importance of the 7 precursors was in the sequence of VOCs>NH<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0PM<sub>2.5</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0OC\u00a0>\u00a0SO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0NO<sub>X</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0Coarse PM. (3) Polytomous logistic regression evaluated the critical factors that influenced the region label, which showed that the reductions of VOCs, NH<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> could achieve the collaborative reduction in a short time in most of cities in China. Based on the statistical results above, a kinetic management system including evaluation and policy-making sections was finally established, which filled the gap of the collaborative reduction in environmental management in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
