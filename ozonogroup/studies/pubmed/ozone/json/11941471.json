To gain insight into copper-modulated patterns of gene expression, copper-treated Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plants were analysed by mRNA differential display. The experimental conditions were selected using aggregation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) as a molecular sensor to monitor copper-induced oxidative stress. Two copper-induced messengers encoding a vegetative storage protein (VSP2) were isolated by this technique. Both clones differed in the length of their 3'-untranslated region according to the presence of two polyadenylation signals in this region. VSP2 expression was further studied under natural senescence and various conditions causing oxidative stress, such as ozone exposure, paraquat and H2O2 treatments. The expression of other messengers related to copper homeostasis and detoxification processes was followed in parallel to that of VSP2. Here, we describe specific gene-expression responses to copper treatment, and present arguments connecting copper homeostasis, senescence and antioxidative responses in plants. Our results are consistent with the role of VSPs as temporary nitrogen-storage proteins which accumulate if nutrients are abundant, either in developing organs or in cotyledons and mature leaves subjected to generalized protein mobilization, such as those conditions created under severe oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament de Bioqu\u00edmica i Biologia Molecular, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Dr Moliner 50, Burjassot, 46100, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mira", "ForeName": "Helena", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "Noem\u00ed", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pe\u00f1arrubia", "ForeName": "Lola", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "VSP2 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LRX7AJ16DT", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PLG39H7695", "NameOfSubstance": "Paraquat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Copper Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Paraquat"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11941471", "10.1007/s00425-001-0706-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
