The current survey was designed to estimate the incidence and understand the factors associated with burnout among cardiac anesthesiologists in India.", "Members of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Anaesthesiologists (IACTA) were invited to participate. The survey consisted of two sections: the initial section collected demographic data, work patterns, and factors associated with burnout perception. The second part assessed emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and low personal accomplishment (LPA) using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS).", "Web-based survey.", "Members of IACTA.", "None.", "A high score on EE (\u226527 and/or DP \u226510) identified those at high risk for burnout. A high risk of burnout in addition to LPA \u226433 was defined as burnout syndrome. Of the 2,262 IACTA members surveyed, 325 (14.35%) responded. Among them, 162 (49.8%) were classified as at high risk of burnout, and 91 (28%) met the criteria for burnout syndrome. Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with a high risk of burnout, including <5 years of experience (odds ratio [OR] = 3.53), insufficient external support (OR = 2.87), limited personal time (OR = 1.96), and considering leaving cardiac anesthesia (OR = 3.61). Factors contributing to burnout syndrome were <5 years of experience (OR = 3.83), inadequate workplace colleague support (OR = 1.84), and considering leaving cardiac anesthesia (OR = 2.43).", "The burden of burnout syndrome is high among Indian anesthesiologists. Risk factors included younger age, inadequate workplace and external support, limited personal time, and contemplation of leaving cardiac anesthesia. There is a need for various stakeholders to be sensitized and institute necessary measures to reduce the burden and impact of burnout."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
