The two main previously known sources of this compound are emissions from the ocean and from the compound's use as an agricultural pesticide. Laboratory biomass combustion experiments showed that methyl bromide was emitted in the smoke from various fuels tested. Methyl bromide was also found in smoke plumes from wildfires in savannas, chaparral, and boreal forest. Global emissions of methyl bromide from biomass burning are estimated to be in the range of 10 to 50 gigagrams per year, which is comparable to the amount produced by ocean emission and pesticide use and represents a major contribution ( approximately 30 percent) to the stratospheric bromine budget."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Man\u00f6", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andreae", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17817427", "10.1126/science.263.5151.1255", "263/5151/1255"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
