Karst., P, sitchensis (Bong-) Carr. and Pinus sylvestris L. were grown from the seedling stage and subjected, by open-air fumigation, to three regimes of SO<sub>2</sub> (ambient, 4 ppb (parts in 10<sup>9</sup> by volume); low, 12 ppb; high, 20 ppb) and two regimes of O<sub>3</sub> (ambient, 25 ppb; high, 30 ppb) in factorial combination, between 1987 and 1990. We determined the abundance of three lichens, Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach., Hypogymnia physodes (L.) Nyl. and Lecanora canizaeoides Nyl. ex Crombie, which colonized the trunks and branches of the saplings, at the end of the experiment between May-July 1991. All three species showed a marked preference for P. abies and were scarcest on P, sylvestris which had the most acidic hark. E. prunastri was the rarest of the three lichens and only colonized plots exposed to ambient SO<sub>2</sub> (4 ppb). Diminutive thalli of H. physodes were relatively numerous in the ambient SO<sub>2</sub> , plots, much scarcer in those receiving low SO<sub>2</sub> (12 ppb) and rare in those with high SO<sub>2</sub> (20 ppbl. Coverage by L. conizaeoides was very low in the ambient SO<sub>2</sub> , plots but appreciable in the low and high SO<sub>2</sub> treatment plots. The results indicate directly beneficial effect of SO<sub>2</sub> on L. conizaeoides colonization rather than an indirect benefit through competitor release. The O<sub>3</sub> treatment (1.3 times ambient during Spring-Autumn) did not influence the abundance of the lichens. All three lichen species appeared to be more sensitive (positive and negative effects) to SO<sub>2</sub> , than mapping studies have suggested. Possible reasons for the high SO<sub>2</sub> -sensitivity of the lichens are discussed. These include the high acidity of conifer bark and the fact that growth from diaspores and development of immature thalli is involved rather than survival of established populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berkshire, SL5 7PY, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berkshire, SL5 7PY, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McNee", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NPTEC Kelvin Avenue, Leatherhead, Surrey, KT22 7SE, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McLeod", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bates JW. 1994.
