Ceramic (alpha-Al(2)O(3)) membranes were chosen because of their ozone resistance. A thin metal oxide (TiO(2) and gamma-Al(2)O(3)) layer was deposited on the membrane surface to eliminate large defects. Membranes were characterized by bubble pressure and gas permeability tests. Mass transfer coefficients were calculated by using the double-film theory. Decolorization kinetics were studied with model dye solutions. Decolorization experiments with a real exhausted dyebath (untreated and after biological treatment) were also carried out. The potential advantages of membrane contactors for the treatment of these types of effluents are demonstrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnotessile S.r.l., via del Gelso 13, Prato, Italy. chemtech@tecnotex.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciardelli", "ForeName": "Gianluca", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciabatti", "ForeName": "Ingrid", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ranieri", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Capannelli", "ForeName": "Gustavo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bottino", "ForeName": "Aldo", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann N Y Acad Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7506858", "ISSNLinking": "0077-8923"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12783808", "10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb05990.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
