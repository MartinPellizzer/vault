The kinetic and mechanistic information on the furfural chemistry is necessary to assess the fate of furfural in the atmosphere and its impact on the air quality. Here we studied the atmospheric oxidation mechanisms of furfural initiated by the OH radicals using quantum chemistry and kinetic calculations. The reaction of OH and furfural was initiated mainly by OH additions to C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> positions, forming R2 and R5 adducts, which could undergo rapid ring-breakage to form R2B and R5B, respectively. Our calculations showed that these intermediate radicals reacted rather slowly with O<sub>2</sub> under the atmospheric conditions because the additions of O<sub>2</sub> to these radicals are only slightly exothermic and highly reversible. Alternatively, these radicals would react directly with O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, HO<sub>2</sub>/RO<sub>2</sub>, etc. Namely, the atmospheric oxidation of furfural would unlikely result in ozone formation. Under typical atmospheric conditions, the main products in OH-initiated furfural oxidation include 2-oxo-3-pentene-1,5-dialdehyde, 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone, 4-oxo-2- butenoic acid, and 2,5-furandione. These compounds will likely stay in the gas phase and are subject to further photo-oxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, South China University of Technology , Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiaocan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8953-250X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, South China University of Technology , Guangzhou 510640, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment and Pollution Control, South China University of Technology , Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liming", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28394125", "10.1021/acs.jpca.7b00506"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
