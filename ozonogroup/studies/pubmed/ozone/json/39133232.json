However, nitrate/nitrite, which absorbs strongly at 222 nm, may affect the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Herein, we evaluated model organic matter and real water samples and observed a substantial increase in the formation potential for trichloronitromethane (chloropicrin) (TCNM-FP), a nitrogenous DBP, by nitrate or nitrite after irradiation at 222 nm. At a disinfection dose of 100 mJ\u00b7cm<sup>-2</sup>, TCNM-FP of humic acids and fulvic acids increased from \u223c0.4 to 25 and 43 \u03bcg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, by the presence of 10 mg-N\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> nitrate. For the effect of nitrate concentration, the TCNM-FP peak was observed at 5-10 mg-N\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. Stronger fluence caused a greater increase of TCNM-FP. Similarly, the increase of TCNM-FP was also observed for wastewater and drinking water samples containing nitrate. Pretreatment using ozonation and coagulation, flocculation, and filtration or the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can effectively control TCNM-FP. The formation potential of other DBPs was minorly affected by irradiation at 222 nm regardless of whether nitrate/nitrite was present. Overall, far-UVC 222 nm treatment poses the risk of increasing TCNM-FP of waters containing nitrate or nitrite at environmentally relevant concentrations and the mitigation strategies merit further research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota 58102, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiale", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0009-0002-7213-6065"], "LastName": "Kann", "ForeName": "Ryan J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota 58102, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Dauda", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3786-094X"], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ching-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39133232", "10.1021/acs.est.4c04258"]}}]}
