However, inventories of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are in fact limited for the environmental management of megacities. In this study, we provided an estimation of BVOC emissions and their spatial characteristics in a typical urbanized area, Shenzhen megacity, China, based on an in-depth vegetation investigation and using remote sensing data. The total BVOC emission in Shenzhen in 2019 was estimated to be 3.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0g\u00a0C, of which isoprene contributed to about 24.4%, monoterpenes about 44.4%, sesquiterpenes about 1.9%, and other VOCs (OVOCs) about 29.3%. Metropolitan BVOC emissions exhibited a seasonal pattern with a peak in July and a decline in January. They were mainly derived from the less built-up areas (88.9% of BVOC emissions). Estimated BVOCs comprised around 5.2% of the total municipal VOC emissions in 2019. This percentage may increase as more green spaces emerge and anthropogenic emissions decrease in built-up areas. Furthermore, synergistic effects existed between BVOC emissions and relevant vegetation-based ecosystem services (e.g., air purification, carbon fixation). Greening during urban sprawl should be based on a trade-off between BVOC emissions and ecosystem benefits of urban green spaces. The results suggested that urban greening in Shenzhen, and like other cities as well, need to account for BVOC contributions to ozone. Meanwhile, greening cites should adopt proactive environmental management by using plant species with low BVOC emissions to maintain urban ecosystem services while avoid further degradation to ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
