Natural killer (NK) activity is an important first line of defense to virally infected cells as well as certain neoplasms; therefore, testing the effects of exposure to toxic compounds on this activity is important in understanding the immunotoxic potential of the compound. Lymphoid cell suspensions, obtained after enzymatic dispersion of rat lungs and purification over nylon wool columns, showed in vitro natural killer activity toward YAC lymphoma cells. Validation of the test with well-known NK activity stimulators such as Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon (IFN), and inhibitors like anti-asialo-GM1 (ganglio-n-tetrasylceramide) antibody confirmed the reliability of the test as an assay for detecting NK activity in rat lungs. Using this assay, we studied the effects of exposure to ozone (O3), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide (TBTO) on NK activity in rat lung. Inhalation exposure to O3 for 7 days at 0.4 and 0.8 mg/m3 resulted in stimulation, and exposure at 1.6 mg O3/m3 resulted in suppression of NK activity. Oral exposure to HCB in concentrations of 150 and 450 mg/kg food for 6 weeks suppressed NK activity in rat lungs in a dose-related manner. This was also true for 6 weeks of oral exposure of rats to 20 and 80 mg TBTO/kg food, but to a lesser extent. In summary, we have developed and validated a method to measure the effects of (toxic) substances on NK activity in rat lung."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Loveren", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krajnc", "ForeName": "E I", "Initials": "EI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rombout", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blommaert", "ForeName": "F A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vos", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trialkyltin Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3353Q84MKM", "NameOfSubstance": "bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Z87H0LKUY", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexachlorobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Separation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hexachlorobenzene"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Trialkyltin Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2136961", "10.1016/0041-008x(90)90080-e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
