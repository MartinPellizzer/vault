To address this knowledge gap, we focused on the western Sichuan Basin (SCB), situated immediately east of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is considered susceptible to MVB coupled with severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution in southwest China. We revealed the MVB driving diurnal O<sub>3</sub> variations and meteorological mechanisms using surface observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. Local MVB days accounted for up to 47% of cases in the summers of 2015-2022. Driven by the MVB, the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased by 8.8%, with 12.7% and 50.0% deterioration in the O<sub>3</sub> light and moderate exceedance rates, respectively, on the western SCB edge. The daytime upslope valley breeze with 20% higher wind speed drove the westward transport of rich O<sub>3</sub> and precursors from the upwind-polluted inner SCB towards its western edge, and the O<sub>3</sub> photochemical production, followed by intensifying solar radiation and air temperature, gave rise to 14.8% of surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over the western SCB edge. The nighttime downward mountain breeze with a 20% increase in wind speed could transport the rich O<sub>3</sub> in the mountainous area to the basin edge, causing O<sub>3</sub> levels to increase by 2.8%. In summary, we quantitatively assessed the impacts of MVB on changes in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and air quality along with its meteorological mechanisms, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of meteorological drivers in the atmospheric environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
