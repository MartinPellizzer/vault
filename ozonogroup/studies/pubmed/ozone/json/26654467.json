Ozone is a pollutant that has a relatively smooth spatial spread over a large scale although there can be significant small-scale variations. We take advantage of these characteristics and demonstrate detection of instrument calibration drift within a few days using a rolling 72 h comparison of hourly averaged data from the test instrument with that from suitably defined proxies. We define the required characteristics of the proxy measurements by working from a definition of the network purpose and specification, in this case reliable determination of the proportion of hourly averaged ozone measurements that are above a threshold in any given day, and detection of calibration drift of greater than \u00b130% in slope or \u00b15 parts-per-billion in offset. By analyzing results of a study of an extensive deployment of low-cost instruments in the Lower Fraser Valley, we demonstrate that proxies can be established using land-use criteria and that simple statistical comparisons can identify low-cost instruments that are not stable and therefore need replacing. We propose that a minimal set of compliant reference instruments can be used to verify the reliability of data from a much more extensive network of low-cost devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, School of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Miskell", "ForeName": "Georgia", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Salmond", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, School of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland 1142, Auckland, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Alavi-Shoshtari", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Ltd, 40A George Street, Mt Eden, Auckland 1024, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Bart", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meteorological Services of Canada, Environment Canada, Vancouver V1V 1V7, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ainslie", "ForeName": "Bruce", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, School of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Grange", "ForeName": "Stuart", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, The University of British Columbia , Vancouver V6T 1ZU, Canada."}], "LastName": "McKendry", "ForeName": "Ian G", "Initials": "IG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aeroqual Ltd, 109 Valley Road, Mt Eden, Auckland 1024, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Henshaw", "ForeName": "Geoff S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, School of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland , Auckland 1142, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "David E", "Initials": "DE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26654467", "10.1021/acs.est.5b04421"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
