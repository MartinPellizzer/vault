The curvature of the microcantilever is measured by an optical system that combines a rapidly scanning laser beam, a position-sensitive detector, and lock-in detection to achieve a long-time stability on the order of 6 mN m(-1) over 4 h and a short-time sensitivity of better than 1 mN m(-1). Thermally oxidized Si shows the smallest changes in interface stress as a function of phenol concentration in water. For hydrophilic SiO(2) prepared by chemical treatment, the change in interface stress at 5 wt % phenol in water is larger than that of thermally oxidized Si by -60 mN m(-1); for SiO(2) formed by exposure of the silicon microcantilever to ozone, the change in surface stress is larger than that of thermally oxidized Si by -330 mN m(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Advanced Materials for the Purification of Water with Systems, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA. xzhang9@uiuc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xijing", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cahill", "ForeName": "David G", "Initials": "DG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17014155", "10.1021/la061032o"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
