These catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in pyrazines degradation and odor elimination. The synthesis of Mn-nN was achieved through a facile urea-assisted heat treatment method. Experimental characterization and theoretical analyses revealed that the MnN structures in Mn-nN, played a crucial role in facilitating the formation of electron-dense Mn sites that served as the primary active sites for ozone activation. In particular, Mn-1N exhibited excellent performance in the HCO system, demonstrating the highest 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-DMP) degradation efficiency. <sup>\u2022</sup>OH was confirmed as the primary reactive oxygen species involved in the HCO process. The second-order rate constants for 2,5-DMP degradation with O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, were determined to be (3.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.018)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-1</sup> and (6.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.844)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Seventeen intermediates were identified through GC-MS analysis during the degradation of 2,5-DMP via HCO process with Mn-1N. The degradation pathways were subsequently proposed by considering these identified intermediates. This study introduces a novel approach to synthesize N-doped Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts and demonstrates their efficacy in HCO for the degradation of pyrazines and the elimination of associated odors. The results show that the catalysts are promising for addressing odor-related environmental issues and provide valuable insights about the broader significance of catalytic ozonation processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
