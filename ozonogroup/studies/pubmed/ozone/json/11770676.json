Decreased exposure to these pollutants or a better understanding of the processes by which they impact the airway may be useful in decreasing asthma severity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Center for Environmental Medicine and Lung Biology, The University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill 27599-7310, USA. peden@med.unc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peden", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}], "NumberOfReferences": "50"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11770676", "10.1016/s1081-1206(10)62334-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
