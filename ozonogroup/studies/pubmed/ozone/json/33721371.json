Pain duration (<\u00a01\u00a0year), type of disk herniation based on Michigan State University classification (MSU), stages of disk degeneration revealed by discogram and absence of foraminal stenosis (bony or ligament flavum hypertrophy) appeared as predictors of successful outcome. Age, gender, previous spine surgery, level site of disk herniation, presence of uncontained lumbar disk herniation, and vertebral Modic changes were not statistically associated with the outcome. Both the models showed a good accuracy (model 1, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.027, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79 to 0.89; model 2, AUC = 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.024, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.91).", "OCN is an effective treatment for radicular pain due to disk herniation.
