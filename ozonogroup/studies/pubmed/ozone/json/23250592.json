Patients had different types of autonomic response (sympathicotonic or normotonic). Autonomic tone at baseline, autonomic reactivity and autonomic supply of activity were determined. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Patients of the main group received ozone therapy along with standard medications. Patients of the control group received standard medications. Disturbances of vascular-autonomic regulation with the domination of ergotropic sympathetic effects were identified in 69.7% of patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease. Ozone therapy caused a shift of the autonomic balance towards the parasympathetic activity as well as the decrease in the activity of the vasomotor center and the central regulation circuit that indicates the increase in the power of defense mechanisms associated with the normalization of autonomic balance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuz'mina", "ForeName": "V Iu", "Initials": "VIu"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khokhlov", "ForeName": "Iu K", "Initials": "IuK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savin", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova", "NlmUniqueID": "9712194", "ISSNLinking": "1997-7298"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Autonomic Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Autonomic Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "physiopathology", "rehabilitation"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrovascular Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23250592"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
