Enhanced UV-B radiation has been considered as important global environmental problem and results in important effects to mankind and the entire global ecosystem. Nitric oxide (NO) is not only a toxic molecule, one of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), but also an important redox-active signaling molecule. NO is really a double-edged sword, it can be either beneficial and activate defense responses in plants and animals or toxic, together with ROS. Besides those, NO can also act as a signal molecule and play very important roles in life of organisms. To study the effects of NO on the biological specific property of enhanced UV-B stressed Spirulina platensis, the chlorophyll-a, protein contents and biomass were investigated under enhanced UV-B radiation and its combination with different chemical treatment. The changes of chlorophyll-a, protein contents and biomass confirmed that 0.5 mmol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a donor of nitric oxide (NO), could markedly alleviate the biological damage of cyanobacteria-Spirulina platensis 794 caused by enhanced ultraviolet-B. Further results proved that NO significantly increase the content of protein and proline. Meanwhile, the accumulation of reduced glutathione (GSH) in S. platensis cells were raised under normal growth condition. But exogenous NO could decrease the increasing of reduced glutathione (GSH) in enhanced UV-B stressed S. platensis cells. These results suggest that NO has protective effect and can strongly alleviate biological damage caused by UV-B stress in S. platensis 794 cells. For the first time, reported the effect of NO on the regulating ability of biological damage of S. platensis induced by enhanced UV-B. Therefore, further investigations will be necessary to inquire into the interaction and inter-correlation of signal molecules and the mechanism in cyanobacterium under enhanced UV-B stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Bioengineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730030, China. xuelg03@st.lzu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Lin-gui", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shi-weng", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shi-jian", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Li-zhe", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xun-ling", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21610860R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Donors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "169D1260KM", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroprusside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Donors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroprusside"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17037055"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
