The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) and the highly disaggregated anthropogenic and the biogenic gridded emissions (1 km x 1 km) recently prepared by the Korean Ministry of Environment were applied. Wind fields with observational nudging in the prognostic meteorological model TAPM are optionally adopted to comparatively examine the meteorological impact on the prediction capabilities of urban-scale air pollutants. The result shows that the simulated concentrations of secondary air pollutant largely agree with observed levels with an index of agreement (IOA) of >0.6, whereas IOAs of approximately 0.4 are found for most primary pollutants in the major cities, reflecting the quality of emission data in the urban area. The observationally nudged wind fields with higher IOAs have little effect on the prediction for both primary and secondary air pollutants, implying that the detailed wind field does not consistently improve the urban air pollution model performance if emissions are not well specified. However, the robust highest concentrations are better described toward observations by imposing observational nudging, suggesting the importance of wind fields for the predictions of extreme concentrations such as robust highest concentrations, maximum levels, and >90th percentiles of concentrations for both primary and secondary urban-scale air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Department, National Institute of Environmental Research, Inch'on, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Il-Soo", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Suk-Jo", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheol-Hee", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Chul", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yong-Hee", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15242150", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470942"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
