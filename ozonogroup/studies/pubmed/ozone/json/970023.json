As opposed to the commonly used chlorine the disinfecting activity of ozone cannot be sustained in the water during the distribution process, and as a result recontamination and bacterial growth are not adequately under control. Information about the safety margins of this disinfecting procedure was obtained in experiments simulating the working conditions of a water plant including supply system. After treatment with 1.5 mg O3/1 water, specimens with no detectable remanent ozone were found to remain sterile for at least one month. However, during the passage of a pipeline of 1200 m length recontamination with and considerable growth of microorganisms was observed. After inoculating water sterilized by ozone with a normal population of water bacteria, the bacterial growth was more pronounced than in similar experiments with heat-sterilized water of the same origin. This may be an indication that the breakdown products of organic water contaminants (e.g. humic acid) - resulting from the ozone treatment - are better nutrients for the water bacteria than the original organic substances themselves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stalder", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klosterk\u00f6tter", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Untersuchungen zur Wiederverkeimung von Trinkwasser nach Ozonbehandlung."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zentralbl Bakteriol Orig B", "NlmUniqueID": "1306477"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1976", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["970023"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
