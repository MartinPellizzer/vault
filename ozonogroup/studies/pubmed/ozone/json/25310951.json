We recently demonstrated that an ozone exposure of 240 ppb is sufficient to reduce lung function indices. We enrolled ten healthy subjects exposed in an intermittent exercise protocol to ozone concentrations of 240 ppb and 40 ppb (sham exposure). EBC-pH and FeNO were assessed before (pre), immediately post (post), and 16 h after exposure (16 h). Findings are that compared to baseline, EBC-pH was significantly higher immediately after sham and ozone exposures, but not 16 h later. There was a negative net change in EBC-pH after adjusting for effects after sham exposure (net-\u0394pHpost -0.38%, net-\u0394pH16h -0.23%). Concerning FeNO, we observed no changes of values after sham exposure compared to baseline, but measured a significant lower net response at the end of exposure (net-\u0394FeNOpost -17.5%) which was transient within 16 h (net-\u0394FeNO16h -9.4%). We conclude that exercise known to enhance EBC-pH may compensate for EBC acidification associated with inflammation resulting in diminished change of this biomarker. Ozone imposes an oxidative burden and reactions between reactive oxygen species and NO might be an explanation for reduced FeNO levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Prevention and Occupational Medicine of the German Social Accident Insurance, Institute of the Ruhr-University Bochum (IPA), B\u00fcrkle-de-la-Camp-Platz 1, 44789, Bochum, Germany, hoffmeyer@ipa-dguv.de."}], "LastName": "Hoffmeyer", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sucker", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mons\u00e9", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berresheim", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jettkant", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rosenkranz", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Br\u00fcning", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcnger", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25310951", "10.1007/5584_2014_63"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
