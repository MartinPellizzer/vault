However, a large amount of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)-containing wastewater is produced in the process of polymer flooding, and this poses a potential threat to the environment. In this study, the treatment of HPAM-containing wastewater was analyzed in an ozonic-anaerobic-aerobic multistage treatment process involving an ozone reactor (OR), an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBR), and an aerobic biofilm reactor (ABR). At an HPAM concentration of 500\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and an ozone dose of 25\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC, the HPAM removal rate reached 85.06%. With fracturing of the carbon chain, high-molecular-weight HPAM was degraded into low-molecular-weight compounds. Microbial communities in bioreactors were investigated via high-throughput sequencing, which revealed that norank_c_Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17, norank_f_Cytophagaceae, and Meiothermus were the dominant bacterial groups, and that Methanobacterium, norank_c_WCHA1-57, and Methanosaeta were the key archaeal genera. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which HPAM-containing wastewater is treated using an ozonic-anaerobic-aerobic multistage treatment system. The ideal degradation performance and the presence of keystone microorganisms confirmed that the multistage treatment process is feasible for treatment of HPAM-containing wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
