It was found that, as compared with the former two techniques, the last two were more effective in organic matter removal, and the efficiency reached 75% - 90%, while the former only at 50% - 60%. The waterworks that adopted the Grade II source raw water were suggested to use the conventional techniques and seasonal preozonation techniques, while the others were suggested to alternatively select GAC or BAC technique to meet the request of new water quality criterion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architectural Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100022, China. hanhongda@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Hong-Da", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yu-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Wen-Jie", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong-Sheng", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17326435"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
