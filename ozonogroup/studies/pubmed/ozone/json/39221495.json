This research employed experimental methods to explore the deactivation effects of LTP on common bacteria such as <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, focusing on the role of air parameters such as the airflow rate, relative humidity, and temperature in influencing the device's performance. Notably, the study determined that an operational voltage of 3000 V for the LTP device, combined with conditions of low airflow, low humidity, and high temperature, significantly enhances the inactivation of bacterial aerosols, achieving an 82% inactivation rate at a negative ion concentration of 2.4 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> ions per m<sup>3</sup> and a wind speed of 3 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Despite the generation of ozone and ultraviolet light as by-products, their concentrations were found to be within safe limits for human exposure. In addition, this study identified an effective inactivation range, alongside an optimal arrangement for the airflow direction within ducts, to maximize the sterilization efficiency of the LTP device. Given these promising results, the study advocates for the integration of LTP technology into the air duct of HVAC systems of public buildings to improve air quality and reduce the risk of airborne disease transmission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Infrastructure Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China. lvyang@dlut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1529-6970"], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Infrastructure Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China. lvyang@dlut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3732-6541"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaodong", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Infrastructure Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China. lvyang@dlut.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": ["0009-0004-8553-2707"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Beibei", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Bioengineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7232-267X"], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39221495", "10.1039/d4em00158c"]}}]}
