A thorough examination and analysis of data obtained from a compilation of 14 studies was undertaken, with a particular emphasis on investigating the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), oxide of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>) on individuals diagnosed with ASD. The findings demonstrate a moderate association between exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ASD, as indicated by a combined odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) spanning from 0.77 to 1.549. O<sub>3</sub> shows a combined odds ratio (OR) of 0.82, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 0.49 to 1.14. NO<sub>x</sub> shows a moderate level of heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 75.9%, p = 0.002), suggesting that the impact of NO<sub>x</sub> on the risk of ASD. There is a statistically significant relationship between exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and ASD, although the strength of this relationship is diminished. The findings demonstrated a noteworthy correlation between exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the occurrence of ASD. The study found a significant correlation, in relation to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with a combined odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 1.11 to 1.34. The findings have significant implications for the formulation of programs aimed at reducing exposure to harmful chemicals, especially among vulnerable groups such as children."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
