To assess any potential chemical transformation of short unsaturated dicarboxylic acids in tropospheric heterogeneous chemistry, maleic and fumaric acid were selected as surrogates in this study. A novel aerosol flow tube apparatus is employed to perform kinetic studies of the oxidation of these organic compounds by gas-phase ozone. The system consists of a particle generation system, a vertically oriented glass flow tube and an infrared observation White cell with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for the detection system. A flow of single component organic aerosols with mean diameters ranging between 0.7 and 1.1 microm is introduced in a flow tube, in which the particles are subsequently exposed to a known concentration of ozone for a controlled period of time. A band assignment of infrared vibrational frequencies for dry maleic and fumaric acid aerosol spectra is presented. These studies are complemented with off-line analysis on the reaction products. The reaction exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics on gas product formation, and the pseudo-first-order rate coefficients displayed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood dependence on gas-phase ozone concentration for both materials. By assuming a Langmuir-Hinshelwood behaviour, the following parameters were obtained: for the reaction of maleic acid aerosols, K(O3) = (3.3 + 0.5) x 10(-16) cm3 molecule(-1) and k(I)(max) = (0.038 + 0.004) s(-1); for the reaction of fumaric acid aerosols, K(O3) = (1.6 + 0.5) x 10(-16) cm3 molecule(-1) and k(I)(max) = (0.048 + 0.007) s(-1), where K(O3) is a parameter that describes the partitioning of ozone to the particle surface and k is the maximum pseudo-first-order coefficient at high ozone concentrations. Apparent reactive uptake coefficients were estimated from the pseudo-first-order rate coefficient and a trend of decreasing uptake coefficients with increasing ozone concentrations was observed, in good agreement with literature values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK M13 9PL."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "N\u00e1jera", "ForeName": "Juan J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horn", "ForeName": "Andrew B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19812829", "10.1039/b909623j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
