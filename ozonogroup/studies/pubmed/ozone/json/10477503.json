Under hypobaric conditions there is an increased risk of hypoxemia. G-forces, positive pressure breathing and anti-G maneuvers cause physical stress to the lung tissue and altered pulmonary blood flow. Breathing with pure oxygen, dry cabin air and ozone can cause airway irritation. Chemically and physically by irritating agents may be present. Emergencies such as smoke in the cockpit or inhalation of tear gas can rapidly compromise the pulmonary system in susceptible persons. Sudden incapacitation may occur. Trapped gases may cause overinflation and lung rupture in rapid decompression. Applicants for military duty have to pass basic lung function tests routinely. Preselection of aircrew candidates tends to be even stricter. Asthma and obstructive lung disease are disqualifying. Trained aircrew with late onset of pulmonary problems can be waived under certain restrictions in many cases. Some national regulations exclude even applicants with allergies. Due to aeromedical experience we should always be aware of the latent unspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). BHR is one of the characteristics of asthma bronchiale. If BHR exists there is an increased risk of later development of asthma bronchiale, especially together with perennial allergies such as against house dust mite. Under certain conditions BHR can become symptomatic and aeromedically relevant. In some cases we saw an exacerbation under medication, mostly under beta-receptor-blockers. In one case even under betablocker-containing eye drops. In the Gulf War 1991 a number of allied military personnel had to be withdrawn because of bronchospastic symptoms. This can be explained among others by medication with physostigmine. Physostigmine is a systemically active cholinergic drug which is prophylactically used under threat of chemically warfare agents. In individuals with latent BHR physostigmine will lower the threshold for bronchial reactions considerably and even cause manifest bronchospasm.", "We recommend an unspecific bronchial challenge test in the selection of personnel for duties where uncompromised lung function under all environmental conditions is essential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "German Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine, Division I, P.O.
