Air pollution in Nanjing has been improving since the implementation of the \"Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan\" in 2013. However, Nanjing still faces PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Evaluating the response of pollutant concentrations to the reductions in precursor emissions is helpful to obtain effective strategies of emission reduction to improve pollution levels. The sensitive simulations of emission perturbation in atmospheric chemistry models directly demonstrate the response of pollution to the reductions in emissions. Nevertheless, these sensitive simulations are limited in computing time and resources. The random forest algorithm was trained by using the simulation results of the atmospheric chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) in 2015. The changes in daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> and daily maximum eight-hour O<sub>3</sub> (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations in Nanjing in 2019 were efficiently predicted under different reduction scenarios of anthropogenic emissions. The simulations showed that the seasonal average of <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in Nanjing would decrease by 2-4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> with the reduction in anthropogenic emissions of 10% in 2019 in China. In the case of controlling only local emissions in Nanjing, the concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Nanjing decreased significantly without local anthropogenic emissions. Additionally, the simulations showed that the annual average of <i>\u03c1</i>(PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in Nanjing could be lower than the national secondary limit (35 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) when the anthropogenic emission reduction in China was higher than 20% in 2019. For ozone, the equal proportional emission reductions in nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) and volatile organic pollutants (VOCs) of O<sub>3</sub> precursors in China likely led to the increase in seasonal average concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> in Nanjing. For the proportional reduction of anthropogenic emissions by 10%-50% in China, the seasonal average of <i>\u03c1</i>(MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) in Nanjing in 2019 would increase by 1-3 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in spring, 1-4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in autumn, and 3-11 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in winter, respectively, compared with that in the base simulation. With the reduction in anthropogenic NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission by 10% and VOCs by 20%, the seasonal average of <i>\u03c1</i>(MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) in Nanjing would decrease by 3-6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. On this basis, further increasing the proportion (30%) of VOCs emission reduction could reduce the annual average of <i>\u03c1</i>(MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) in Nanjing by 7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. However, the annual average of <i>\u03c1</i>(MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) of Nanjing in 2019 increased by 1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, with the local emission reduction of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> by 10% and VOCs by 30%. Therefore, this showed that the key to alleviate ozone pollution in Nanjing is a reasonable control ratio of ozone precursor emissions and the implementation of regional joint prevention and control. In order to effectively reduce the O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Nanjing, the emission reduction ratio of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs in China should be less than 1:2. The response of pollutant concentrations to reductions in precursor emissions were efficiently obtained by the random forest algorithm and GEOS-Chem model. The simulations would provide the scientific basis for the emission control strategy to alleviate air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Yong-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education (KLME), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters (CIC-FEMD), International Joint Research Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Yu-Hao", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education (KLME), Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters (CIC-FEMD), International Joint Research Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Ze-Yong", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37694620", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202209163"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
