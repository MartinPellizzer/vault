Biomass significantly decreased with increasing O(3) dose in all species except for spruce. Losses of 25.5% (ash), 17.4% (beech), 9.9% (Scots pine) were found per 10 microl l(-1) h accumulated O(3) exposure over a threshold concentration of 40 nl l(-1) during daylight hours (AOT40). Ratios of root/shoot biomass (RSR) also significantly decreased with increasing AOT40 levels in beech and ash, but not in Norway spruce and Scots pine. The data show that the deciduous species beech and ash were more susceptible to O(3) with respect to RSR and biomass than the coniferous species Norway spruce and Scots pine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland. werner.landolt@wsl.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landolt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fchlmann", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bleuler", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bucher", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092880", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00050-6", "S0269-7491(00)00050-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
