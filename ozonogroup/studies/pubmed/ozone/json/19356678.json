In the present study we have investigated the effects of chronic (30 or 60 days) exposure to ozone on olfactory perception and memory and on levels of lipid peroxidation, alpha and beta estrogen receptors and dopamine beta-hydroxylase in the olfactory bulb in ovariectomized female rats. The ability of 17beta-estradiol to prevent these effects was then assessed. Results showed that ozone exposure for 30 or 60 days impaired formation/retention of a selective olfactory recognition memory 120 min after exposure to a juvenile stimulus animal with the effect at 60 days being significantly greater than at 30 days. They also showed impaired speed in locating a buried chocolate reward after 60 days of ozone exposure indicating some loss of olfactory perception. These functional impairments could all be prevented by coincident estradiol treatment. In the olfactory bulb, levels of lipid peroxidation were increased at both 30- and 60-day time-points and numbers of cells with immunohistochemical staining for alpha and beta estrogen receptors, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase were reduced as were alpha and beta estrogen receptor protein levels. These effects were prevented by estradiol treatment. Oxidative stress damage caused by chronic exposure to ozone does therefore impair olfactory perception and social recognition memory and may do so by reducing noradrenergic and estrogen receptor activity in the olfactory bulb. That these effects can be prevented by estradiol treatment suggests increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders in aging women may be contributed to by reduced estrogen levels post-menopause."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Mexico, Apartado Postal 70250, Mexico 04510, D.F, Mexico. rguevara@servidor.unam.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guevara-Guzm\u00e1n", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arriaga", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kendrick", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernal", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vega", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mercado-G\u00f3mez", "ForeName": "O F", "Initials": "OF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivas-Arancibia", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Neuroscience", "NlmUniqueID": "7605074", "ISSNLinking": "0306-4522"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogen Receptor alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogen Receptor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.17.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Receptor alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Receptor beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Olfactory Bulb"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Olfactory Perception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Recognition, Psychology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Perception"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19356678", "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.01.047", "S0306-4522(09)00047-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
