At 24 hr after the pretreatment DMSO (3.0 ml/kg), phenanthrene (150 mg/kg), ozonized or nitrated products of phenanthrene (150 mg/kg), pyrene (150 mg/kg), or ozonized or nitrated products of pyrene (150 mg/kg) were injected ip. Phenanthrene, pyrene, and their ozonized or nitrated products were dissolved in DMSO (50 mg/ml). No increase in the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) was seen in the pretreated rats 48 hr after the treatment. This is in contrast to what was seen in previous work without the BNF pretreatment. BNF pretreatment induced a small but significant increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels. No treatment group receiving BNF differed from another with respect to GGTP. A decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels was noted in the nitro-PAH treatment groups; the same phenomenon was observed earlier in rats treated with nitro-PAH without BNF treatment. These results suggest that the mixed-function oxidase systems specifically induced by BNF have a protective effect against the hepatotoxicity of the oxonized or nitrated products of phenanthrene and pyrene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruhr", "ForeName": "L P", "Initials": "LP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flory", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banton", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giamalva", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Church", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pryor", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-16029", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6051-87-2", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Naphthoflavone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta-Naphthoflavone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3576942"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
