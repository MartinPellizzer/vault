The life cycle assessment (LCA) technique has become a common tool to evaluate those impacts. The present study aimed to contribute to the better understanding of the application of this technique, by evaluating the influence of the selection of the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method in its results and conclusions. A specific case study was chosen, using previous information related to an anti-glare lamellae (AGL) for highway use, made with virgin and recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Five distinct LCIA methods were used: Eco-indicator 99, CML 2 (2000), EPS 2000, Eco-indicator 95 and EDIP 97. Consistent results between these methods were obtained for the Climate change, Ozone layer depletion, Acidification and Eutrophication environmental indicators. Conversely, the Summer smog indicator showed large discrepancies between impact assessment methods. The work sheds light on the advantages inherent in using various LCIA methods when doing the LCA study of a specific product, thus evidencing complementary analysis perspectives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Polymers and Composites/I3N, University of Minho, Campus de Azur\u00e9m, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal. csimoes@dep.uminho.pt"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sim\u00f5es", "ForeName": "Carla L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xar\u00e1", "ForeName": "Susana M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernardo", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9881064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9002-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manufactured Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recycling"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Safety Management"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21558083", "10.1177/0734242X11403799", "0734242X11403799"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
