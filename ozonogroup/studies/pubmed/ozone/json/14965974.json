Near the end of the second season of O(3) exposure, gas exchange was measured on needles of surviving flushes at saturating CO(2) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Both photosynthetic capacity (A(sat)) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g(wv)) declined linearly with needle age but differences within a flush were also found. Gas exchange rates of needles from the base of the current-year flush were significantly lower than those of needles from the top of the flush, even though age differences between needles were negligible. Although most measurements were conducted at saturating CO(2), similar patterns of gas exchange were also found at 350 micro mol mol(-1) CO(2), indicating that photosynthesis of needles at the bottom of the flush was more strongly affected by O(3) than that of needles at the top of the flush, even though the potential for O(3) uptake was probably less in needles at the bottom of the flush because of reduced stomatal conductance. Carboxylation efficiency (deltaA/deltaC(i)), the linear slope of the A/C(i) response, was highly correlated with A(sat), varying with needle age, needle position in the flush and O(3) exposure, but the magnitude of the reductions was greater than for A(sat). We conclude that susceptibility to O(3) damage among needles of an individual seedling varies not only with needle age but also with needle position, and that reductions in photosynthetic capacity may not be directly attributable to increased uptake of the pollutant. The data also indicate the need to consider within-flush variation when estimating whole-plant carbon gain and O(3) uptake."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ManTech Environmental Technology Inc., 200 SW 35th Street, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hogsett", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14965974", "10.1093/treephys/15.3.181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
