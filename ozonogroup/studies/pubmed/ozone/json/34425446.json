To fill this knowledge gap, vertical profiling (0-500 m and 0-900 m, AGL) of BC and O<sub>3</sub> was conducted in a highly urbanized area of Shenzhen in subtropical South China using a multicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. In total 32 flights were conducted from the 10th to 15th, December 2017 (winter campaign) and 42 flights from the 19th to 28th, August 2018 (summer campaign) with 4 time slots per day, including morning, afternoon, evening, and midnight. In general, equivalent BC (eBC) concentration decreased as the height increased with an overall slope of -0.13 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> per 100 m in the winter campaign and -0.08 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> per 100 m in the summer campaign. On the contrary, an increase of O<sub>3</sub> level with altitude was observed (7.8 ppb per 100 m). Absorption \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent (AAE) exhibits a slightly increasing trend with height. Seasonality of eBC vertical profiles was observed in morning, afternoon and midnight flights, but not for evening flights. The analysis showed the shape of vertical profiles of eBC and O<sub>3</sub> can be affected by planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and air mass origin. Calculated heating rates due to BC show distinct seasonal variability for morning but not for afternoon, because of the counteracting effects by solar irradiance in the subtropical afternoon and eBC concentration in urban South China influenced by the monsoon climate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
