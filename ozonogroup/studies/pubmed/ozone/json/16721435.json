Infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy is used to observe gas-phase products generated during ozonolysis and subsequent photolysis of SAM in real time. Reactions taking place during ozonolysis transform alkene-terminated SAM into a photochemically active state capable of photolysis in the tropospheric actinic window (lambda > 295 nm). Formaldehyde and formic acid are the observed photolysis products. Photodissociation action spectra of oxidized SAM and the observed pattern of gas-phase products are consistent with the well-established Criegee mechanism of ozonolysis of terminal alkenes. There is strong evidence for the presence of secondary ozonides (1,3,4-trioxalones) and other peroxides on the oxidized SAM surface. The data imply that photolysis plays a role in atmospheric aging of primary and secondary organic aerosol particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, 92697-2025, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jiho", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomez", "ForeName": "Anthony L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walser", "ForeName": "Maggie L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ao", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16721435", "10.1039/b602704k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
