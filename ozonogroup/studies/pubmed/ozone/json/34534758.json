In this study, an integrated coagulation-ozonation (ICO) process was used to pretreat HO-EDWs and the influences on the characteristics of dissolved organic pollutants (DOPs) were investigated. Coagulation using aluminum sulfate removed 39% of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), 21% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 57% of petroleum hydrocarbons and 38% of polar oils from Liaohe HO-EDWs and the biodegradability was greatly improved. Ozonation removed 33% of SCOD and 88% of polar oils from the coagulated HO-EDWs. Most species of aromatic compounds, phenols, aliphatic acids, anilines and naphthenic acids with high C numbers and ring numbers were degraded and the unsaturation degrees of DOPs significantly decreased under ozonation. As a result, the biodegradability was further improved and the acute toxicity towards Vibrio fischeri was substantially reduced. Some O<sub>x</sub>S<sub>1</sub> species and organic nitrogen compounds in HO-EDWs were penetrated through ozonation and caused the residual biotoxicity. The results demonstrate the potential of ICO pretreatment for improving the quality of refractory HO-EDWs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
