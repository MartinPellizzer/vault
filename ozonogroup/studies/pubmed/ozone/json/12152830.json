Karst.] were exposed during four growing seasons to two different ozone treatments in open-top chambers: charcoal filtered air (CF), and non-filtered air with extra ozone (NF+, 1.4xambient concentrations). Within each ozone treatment the saplings were either kept well watered or treated with a 7-8 week period with reduced water supply each growing season. The total biomass of the trees was measured in April and September during each of the last three growing seasons. NF+ significantly reduced the total biomass accumulation of Norway spruce saplings during the fourth growing season. No interaction between ozone and reduced water supply could be detected. The magnitude of the ozone impact after 4 years of exposure was an 8% reduction of the total plant biomass and a 1.5% reduction of the RGR. The reduced water supply reduced the total biomass 29% and the RGR 12%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swedish Environmental Research Institute, G\u00f6teborg. pererik.karlsson@ivl.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karlsson", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medin", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selld\u00e9n", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wallin", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ottosson", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pleijel", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sk\u00e4rby", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12152830", "10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00330-x", "S0269-7491(01)00330-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
