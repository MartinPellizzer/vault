The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of ozone exposure on memory and to correlate this with pulmonary and brain Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Male Wistar rats were exposed for 4 h to one of the following ozone concentrations: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 ppm. Subsequently, they were tested in a passive avoidance conditioning protocol to measure short and long-term memory. Motor activity was determined 1 and 24 h after ozone exposure. Cu/Zn SOD levels in the brain and pulmonary tissue were also measured. Rats exposed for 4 h to 0.2, 0.5, and 1 ppm ozone showed long-term memory deterioration and decreased motor activity, which was reversed 24 h later. Brain and pulmonary Cu/Zn SOD levels were increased in animals exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 ppm ozone doses, but decreased in animals exposed to 1 ppm ozone. The results suggest that ozone exposure affects long-term memory possibly in association oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, D.F., M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivas-Arancibia", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vazquez-Sandoval", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez-Kladiano", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schneider-Rivas", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lechuga-Guerrero", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory, Short-Term"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9466895", "10.1006/enrs.1997.3784", "S0013-9351(97)93784-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
