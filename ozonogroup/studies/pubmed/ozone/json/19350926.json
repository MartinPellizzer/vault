In this study, a benchtop photocatalytic flow reactor was used to evaluate the efficiency of hectorite-TiO2 and kaolinite-TiO2, two novel composite materials synthesized in our laboratory. Toluene, a model hydrophobic VOC and a common indoor air pollutant, was introduced in the air stream at realistic concentrations, and reacted under UVA (lamda(max) = 365 nm) or UVC (lamda(max) = 254 nm) irradiation. The UVC lamp generated secondary emission at 185 nm, leading to the formation of ozone and other short-lived reactive species. Performance of clay-Ti02 composites was compared with that of pure TiO2 (Degussa P25), and with UV irradiation in the absence of photocatalyst under identical conditions. Films of clay-TiO2 composites and of P25 were prepared by a dip-coating method on the surface of Raschig rings, which were placed inside the flow reactor. An upstream toluene concentration of approximately 170 ppbv was generated by diluting a constant flow of toluene vapor from a diffusion source with dry air, or with humid air at 10, 33, and 66% relative humidity (RH). Toluene concentrations were determined by collecting Tenax-TA sorbent tubes downstream of the reactor, with subsequent thermal desorption--GC/MS analysis. The fraction of toluene removed, %R, and the reaction rate, Tr, were calculated for each experimental condition from the concentrations measured with and without UV irradiation. Use of UVC light (UV/TiO2/O3) led to overall higher reactivity, which can be partially attributed to the contribution of gas phase reactions by short-lived radical species. When the reaction rate was normalized to the light irradiance, Tr/Ilamda,the UV/TiO2 reaction under UVA irradiation was more efficient for samples with a higher content of TiO2 (P25 and Hecto-TiO2), but notfor Kao-TiO2. In all cases, reaction rates peaked at 10% RH, with Tr values between 10 and 50% higherthan those measured under dry air. However, a net inhibition was observed as RH increased to 33% and 66%, indicating that water molecules competed effectively with toluene for reactive surface sites and limited the overall photocatalytic conversion. Compared to P25, inhibition by coadsorbed water was less significant for Kao-TiO2 samples, but was more dramatic for Hecto-TiO2 due to the high water uptake capacity of hectorite."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Circuito Exterior, Ciudad Universitaria, Coyoac\u00e1n, C.P. 04150, M\u00e9xico City, M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kibanova", "ForeName": "Daria", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cervini-Silva", "ForeName": "Javiera", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Destaillats", "ForeName": "Hugo", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Silicates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T1FAD4SS2M", "NameOfSubstance": "Clay"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Silicates"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nanocomposites"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19350926", "10.1021/es803032t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
