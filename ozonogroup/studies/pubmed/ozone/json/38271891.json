Seventy-seven adult male rats were divided into six groups: Sal, saline; Car, carrageenan; Ibup +\u00a0Sal, ibuprofen and saline; Ibup +\u00a0Car, ibuprofen and carrageenan; O3\u00a0+\u00a0Sal, ozone and saline; and O3\u00a0+\u00a0Car, ozone and carrageenan. The mixture of 5% ozone and 95% oxygen (20\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) was administered three times in the course of a week. Nociceptive responses in the masseter muscles were measured using a head withdrawal threshold, determined by an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer. The animals were euthanized one or eight days after the carrageenan injection, and the masseters were submitted to histological and histomorphometric analyses.", "Mechanical allodynia and inflammation levels were reduced in the Ibup +\u00a0Car group compared to the other groups. Myonecrosis was similar among carrageenan-treated groups. Picrosirius red stained sections showed more collagen fibers and more regenerating myofibers in the O3\u00a0+\u00a0Car group compared to the other groups. Eight days after carrageenan injection, the O3\u00a0+\u00a0Car group showed neutrophils close to the regenerating myofibers.", "Intramuscular ozone therapy did not alleviate mechanical allodynia, and it did not protect the masseter muscle against the deleterious effects produced by carrageenan, probably due to the mode of administration of this therapeutic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
