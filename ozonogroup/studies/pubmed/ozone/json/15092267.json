Before exposures began, seedlings grown in the vermiculite-peat substrate were taller but smaller in diameter than those grown in the mineral soil-peat substrate. After 8 weeks of exposure, seedlings grown in the mineral soil-peat substrate were significantly larger in diameter and total biomass than those grown in the vermiculite-peat substrate. Primary needle and secondary needle injury increased with increasing O3 concentrations. Suppression of diameter growth, shoot weight and root weight was linear as O3 concentration increased. The effect of O3 on height or diameter growth or shoot biomass was not influenced by substrate type; but the suppression of root biomass due to O3 was dependent on substrate, with greater suppression in biomass occurring in the vermiculite-peat substrate. Foliar injury due to O3 was slightly greater in family 8-103, but growth suppression due to O3 was not significantly different among the families. Based on root biomass, response of seedlings to O3 was substrate-dependent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horton", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinert", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heck", "ForeName": "W W", "Initials": "WW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092267", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90089-u", "0269-7491(90)90089-U"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
