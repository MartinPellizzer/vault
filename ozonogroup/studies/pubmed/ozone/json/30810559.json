Nevertheless, the incidence of skin cancers continues to increase in most light-skinned populations, probably due mainly to risky sun exposure behaviour. In locations with strong sun protection programs of long duration, incidence is now reducing in younger age groups. Changes in the epidemiology of UV-induced eye diseases are less clear, due to a lack of data. Exposure to UV radiation plays a role in the development of cataracts, pterygium and possibly age-related macular degeneration; these are major causes of visual impairment world-wide. Photodermatoses and phototoxic reactions to drugs are not uncommon; management of the latter includes recognition of the risks by the prescribing physician. Exposure to UV radiation has benefits for health through the production of vitamin D in the skin and modulation of immune function. The latter has benefits for skin diseases such as psoriasis and possibly for systemic autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The health risks of sun exposure can be mitigated through appropriate sun protection, such as clothing with both good UV-blocking characteristics and adequate skin coverage, sunglasses, shade, and sunscreen. New sunscreen preparations provide protection against a broader spectrum of solar radiation, but it is not clear that this has benefits for health. Gaps in knowledge make it difficult to derive evidence-based sun protection advice that balances the risks and benefits of sun exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Research School of Population Health, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. robyn.lucas@anu.edu.au and Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2736-3541"], "LastName": "Lucas", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia and MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0994-6196"], "LastName": "Yazar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King's College London, London, UK."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4163-6772"], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Norval", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6264-3982"], "LastName": "de Gruijl", "ForeName": "F R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Akita University School of Medicine, National Institute for Minamata Disease, Nakadai, Itabashiku, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takizawa", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Dermatology Research, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, The University of Manchester and Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9107-6654"], "LastName": "Rhodes", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Australia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6467-1191"], "LastName": "Sinclair", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research, Herston, Brisbane, Australia and School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Australia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7162-0854"], "LastName": "Neale", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101124451", "ISSNLinking": "1474-905X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stratospheric Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Stratospheric Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30810559", "10.1039/c8pp90060d"]}}]}
