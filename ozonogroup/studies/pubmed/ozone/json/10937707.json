Drought conditions were imposed on 2-year-old plants by withholding water. During the onset of water stress, analyses of the response of net carbon assimilation of leaves to their intercellular CO2 concentration were used to examine the potential limitations imposed by stomata, carboxylation velocity and capacity for regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate on photosynthesis. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence were used to determine changes in the efficiency of light utilization for electron transport, the occurrence of photoinhibition of photosystem II photochemistry and the possibility of stomatal patchiness across leaves. The first stages of water stress produced decreases in the light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation which were accompanied by decreases in the maximum carboxylation velocity and the capacity for regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate in the absence of any significant photodamage to photosystem II. Leaves of rosemary and lavender were more sensitive than those of olive during the first stages of the drought treatment and also exhibited increases in stomatal limitation. With increasing water stress, significant decreases in the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry occurred in lavender and rosemary, and stomatal limitation was increased in olive. No indication of any heterogeneity of photosynthesis was found in any leaves. Drought treatment significantly decreased leaf area in all species, an important factor in drought-induced decreases in photosynthetic productivity. Exposure of plants to elevated UV-B radiation (0.47 W m(-2)) prior to and during the drought treatment had no significant effects on the growth or photosynthetic activities of the plants. Consequently, it is predicted that increasing UV-B due to future stratospheric ozone depletion is unlikely to have any significant impact on the photosynthetic productivity of olive, lavender and rosemary in the field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nogu\u00e9s", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disasters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10937707", "10.1093/jxb/51.348.1309"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
