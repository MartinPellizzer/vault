The experimental findings unveiled that under the specified conditions, the degradation percentages of TEB were raised to 99% within 40\u00a0s, 5\u00a0min, and 3\u00a0min for UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, UV/NaClO and ozonation, respectively. The mineralization percentages within 1\u00a0h were 59%, 31% and 8% for the three AOPs. UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV/NaClO technologies mainly acted through OH\u00b7, while O<sub>3</sub> treatment primarily relied on the free radicals such as <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup>. UV-based AOPs achieved almost complete dechlorination within 1\u00a0h, whereas O<sub>3</sub> treatment had a less effective dechlorination, reaching only 27.61%. Notably, UV alone achieved a dechlorination percentage of 43.07%. By identifying the TPs, we found that the three AOPs shared three similar degradation pathways. The degradation mechanism of TEB mainly entailed the removal of the benzene ring, tert-butyl group and triazolyl group. Toxicity assessment revealed an initial increase followed by a gradual decrease in toxicity for UV/NaClO and O<sub>3</sub> treatments, whereas UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment exhibited a sustained decrease. This was due to the presence of TP278 and TP303 by UV/NaClO and TP168 and TP153 by ozonation. After estimating the costs of the three AOPs, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> standed out as the best choice for achieving a 90% degradation percentage and exhibiting lower toxicity performance, while O<sub>3</sub> treatment was favored for low TOC demands. These research findings provided valuable reference for understanding the degradation mechanism and developing a new technology of the removal of TEB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
