Ganlong No. 92-005) exposed to (0) control, 8.64 (T1) and 11.2 kJ m(-2) day(-1) (T2) biologically effective UV-B irradiation (UV-B(BE)) were studied under greenhouse conditions. These irradiance levels correspond to a decrease in the stratospheric ozone of approximately 12.5 and 20%, respectively, for a clear solstice day at Lanzhou (36.04 degrees N, 1550 m), China. Compared with controls, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased by 70.8% in T1 and 83.8% in T2 on the 7th day of the radiation, and the IUFA (index of unsaturated fatty acids) decreased, indicating peroxidation of lipid acids. Simultaneously, a drastic decrease of phospholipid content after 21 days and an increase of membrane lipid microviscosity on UV-B irradiation were also found, suggesting a reduction in the fluidity of membrane lipids. Ethylene emission by the microsomal membrane, in the presence of exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid was higher in the wheat seedlings after 7, 14 and 21 days' irradiation than in the controls. These changes were correlated with a rise in lipoxygenase activity. Membrane-bound enzymes (Ca2+ -ATPase and Mg2+ -ATPase) were promoted by UV radiation in the first 7 days and significantly decreased after 14 and 21 days' treatment in comparison to control. Our results suggest that UV-B radiation may cause changes in structural complexity and function of microsomal membranes in spring wheat leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, State Key Laboratory of Arid Agrioecology, Lanzhou University, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11100838", "10.1016/s1011-1344(00)00077-4", "S1011-1344(00)00077-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
