Amines containing diethylamine (DEA) groups in the structure would generate NDEA during the disinfection processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of reducing NDEA formation from a commonly used dithiocarbamate pesticide sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC) in subsequent chlorination and chloramination by pre-ozonation. The results demonstrated that NDEA could be generated directly during ozonation, its amounts increased from 0 to 14.34\u00a0\u03bcg/L with increasing ozone dosages (0-4\u00a0mg/L), which was higher than that chlorination (2.68\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and chloramination (4.91\u00a0\u03bcg/L) when the initial concentration of DEDTC was 20\u00a0\u03bcM. Pre-ozonation significantly raised NDEA formation from 2.68 to15.32\u00a0\u03bcg/L in subsequent chlorination; and that from 4.91 to 9.54\u00a0\u03bcg/L during subsequent chloramination processes. The addition of \u2022OH scavenger tert-butanol (tBA) increased the production of NDEA from 8.14 to 20.80\u00a0\u03bcg/L during ozonation, and that from 6.76 to17.98\u00a0\u03bcg/L in O<sub>3</sub>/HClO process, 8.74 to 17.33\u00a0\u03bcg/L in O<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub>Cl process. Except for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, most of the co-existing substances promoted NDEA generation from DEDTC under disinfection conditions. Based on the results of Gaussian theory calculations, GC/MS and UPLC-Q-TOFMS analysis, the influencing mechanisms of pre-ozonation on NDEA generation in the subsequent disinfection process were proposed. In addition, not only acute/chronic toxicity calculation but also luminescent bacteria test was performed to assess the possibility of pre-ozonation on the risk control of DEDTC. The research results fill a gap in the control of NDEA pollution and help to develop a safer ozone oxidation technology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
