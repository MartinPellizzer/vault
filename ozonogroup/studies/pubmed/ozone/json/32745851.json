The aim of this study is to examine in detail the time patterns of O<sub>3</sub> in the Czech Republic, a Central European country with a long-term history of ambient air pollution. We have examined the interplay between annual trends and within-a-year seasonality in daily O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at twelve stations representing different environments, geographical regions and altitudes in the Czech Republic in 1993-2018. We base our analysis on a generalised additive model (GAM) framework as a modern regression approach suitable for addressing non-linear trend shapes in a formalised and unified way. In particular, we use penalised splines. The inconsistent behaviour of the stations prior to 1998, two local maxima around 2003 and 2006 and a steady increase in O<sub>3</sub> at all sites from 2014 to the present are the main features of our study. A seasonality O<sub>3</sub> pattern with a clear maximum in May-June is similar for all stations. In parallel with the O<sub>3</sub> concentration changes over the years, the deformation of seasonality profiles over a long period of time occurs, resulting in a shift of the peak O<sub>3</sub> concentrations towards later days in the year. Our statistical modelling offers a detailed view of both long-term trend and seasonality components separately. Additionally, in a model with trend*seasonality interaction, we are able to study the gradual deformation of the seasonality profile over the years. Capsule: Our analysis of daily mean O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at twelve Czech sites in 1993-2018 revealed a steady increase in O<sub>3</sub> from 2014 and deformation of the seasonality O<sub>3</sub> profiles over the year."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
