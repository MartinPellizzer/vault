The code is restricted to pools in hotels and other lodging places. The absence of modern regulations for public hydrotherapy and swimming pools has permitted serious deficiencies in pool maintenance, which are highlighted in this report. The most notable of these deficiencies was the presence of high levels of bacterial contamination that could predispose to infect in the water of one public hot tub. The results of this study indicate that the Virginia Board of Health sanitary code for pool water must be revised immediately and should include all public hydrotherapy and swimming pools. Other states and communities may want to assess their codes for swimming pools and hydrotherapy tubs to avoid deficiencies that could be detrimental to public health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plastic Surgery, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville 22908."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zura", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gr\u00f6schel", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Becker", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edlich", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Burn Care Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "8110188", "ISSNLinking": "0273-8481"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Halogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "State Health Plans"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Swimming Pools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virginia"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2335553", "10.1097/00004630-199003000-00011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
