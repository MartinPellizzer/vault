Cutaneous trunci muscles were obtained from a local beef cattle processing plant. Muscles were divided into sixteen 25-cm<sup>2</sup> sections, and each section was individually inoculated with <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 to the final concentration of approximately 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/cm<sup>2</sup>. Muscle sections were collected and tested before and after simulated spray chill treatments of water or the novel aqueous ozone solution. Enumeration of survivors of each treatment was compared with that of the untreated muscle sections. Water spray chill reduced (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.05) <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 0.60 log, whereas the aqueous ozone spray chill reduction (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.05) was 1.46 log on surfaces of fresh beef. Aqueous ozone spray chill reduced (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.05) aerobic bacteria 0.99 log, but water spray chill did not significantly (<i>P</i> > 0.05) reduce aerobic bacteria on surfaces of fresh beef. The findings indicate that aqueous ozone can be used as a spray chill intervention to enhance the safety of beef."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska 68933-0166 (ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6571-9097 [T.L.W.])."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalchayanand", "ForeName": "Norasak", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TetraClean/CleanCore Technologies, LLC, Omaha, Nebraska 68144, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Worlie", "ForeName": "Drew", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, Nebraska 68933-0166 (ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6571-9097 [T.L.W.])."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "Tommy", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Red Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31622163", "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-19-093", "S0362-028X(22)10518-1"]}}]}
