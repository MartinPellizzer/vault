Research interests have been fostered because UVB has been increasing in recent years due to depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ultraviolet-B that penetrates into plant tissue may damage important cellular macromolecules. Although there has been considerable research on the effects of UVB on plants, the influence of the level of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm) on effects of UVB requires further definition as a prelude to studies of UVB sensitivity and defense mechanisms. Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type ecotype Landsberg erecta (LER), which is relatively insensitive to UVB, and the relatively sensitive LER-based mutant transparent testa-5 (tt5), were grown under 100 or 250 mumol m-2 s-1 PAR and then exposed to (zero) or 7 kJ m-2 day-1 UVBBE under these PAR levels. Plants exposed to UVB had reduced dry weight and leaf area and higher levels of UV-absorbing compounds in leaf tissue. The level of PAR did influence the effects of UVB, with the higher level of PAR prior to UVB exposure reducing sensitivity of LER to UVB. In contrast to other studies, higher PAR supplied simultaneously with UVB increased rather than decreased sensitivity of both genotypes to UVB. These results demonstrate the importance of controlling and comparing PAR levels when undertaking studies of UVB sensitivity, as effects of UVB on plants are influenced by the PAR levels plants are growing under prior to and during exposure to UVB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. eberkela@uoguelph.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berkelsar", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormrod", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hale", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photobiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8787005", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb02429.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
