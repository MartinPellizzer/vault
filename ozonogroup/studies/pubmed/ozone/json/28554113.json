Cathay poplar (Populus cathayana) saplings were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> (CF, charcoal-filtered air, NF, non-filtered ambient air and E-O<sub>3</sub>, non-filtered air +40ppb) and N treatments (N0, 0kgNha<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup>, N50, 50kgNha<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup> and N100, 100kgNha<sup>-1</sup>year<sup>-1</sup>) for 96days. Increasing O<sub>3</sub> exposure decreased isoprene emission (11.5% in NF and 57.9% in E-O<sub>3</sub>), as well as light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A<sub>sat</sub>) and chlorophyll content, while N load increased isoprene emission (19.6% in N50 and 33.4% in N100) as well as A<sub>sat</sub> and chlorophyll content. Although O<sub>3</sub> and N interacted significantly in A<sub>sat</sub>, N did not mitigate the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on isoprene emission, i.e. the combined effects were additive and did not interact. These results warrant more research on the combined effects of co-existing global change factors on future isoprene emission and atmospheric chemical processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
