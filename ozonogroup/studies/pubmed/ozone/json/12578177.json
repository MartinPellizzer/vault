During the experiment, various kinds of metallic ions (Pb+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Ti2+, and Mn2+) were added; it was found that the reaction rate increased in all cases. The best result was obtained by using manganese ions, followed by iron and titanium ions. At pH = 3 and 1 ppm Mn2+ concentration, the reaction rate was increased by three times. TOC removal rate was also increased from 12.6% to 38% at 60 min reaction time. Ozone self-decomposition with various kinds of metallic ions alone was tested. It was found the ozone self-decomposition coefficient is highly dependent on the reaction rate constant for ozonation of 2-chlorophenol. The improvement of reaction was relevant to the mechanism of reaction between ozone and metallic ions. Furthermore, the effect of adding manganese ions was studied. With the initial manganese concentration at 0-2 ppm, after gas exposure for 20 min the removal rate can be increased from 38% to 93%. TOC removal rate was increased from 11% to 38%. The reaction rate was improved more greatly at the initial pH = 3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, No.75, Poai Street Hsin-Chu 300, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "P Y", "Initials": "PY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K9KAV4K6BN", "NameOfSubstance": "2-chlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12578177"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
