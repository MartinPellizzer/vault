It is used for different purposes and in different industries worldwide. This cereal is prone to contamination with mycotoxins, such as zearalenone (ZEN), which is produced mainly by Fusarium graminearum, F. culmorum and F. equiseti. Toxin production under highly moist conditions (aw > 0.95) is exacerbated if there are alternations between low temperatures (12-14 \u00b0C) and high temperatures (25-28 \u00b0C). Even if good production practices are adopted, mycotoxins can be found in several stages of the production chain. For this reason, an alternative to reducing this contamination is ozonation. This study evaluated the reduction of ZEN in naturally contaminated whole maize flour (WMF) treated with 51.5 mg\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> of ozone for up to 60\u2009min. Pasting properties, peroxide value, and fatty acid composition were also evaluated.", "Zearalenone degradation in ozonated WMF was described by a fractional first-order kinetic, with a maximum reduction of 62.3% and kinetic parameter of 0.201\u2009min<sup>-1</sup> in the conditions that were evaluated. The ozonation process in WMF showed a decrease in the apparent viscosity, a decrease in the proportion of linoleic, oleic, and \u03b1-linolenic fatty acids, an increase in the proportion of palmitic acid, and an increase in the peroxide value.", "Ozonation was effective in reducing ZEN contamination in WMF. However, it also modified the pasting properties, fatty acid profile, and peroxide value, affecting functional and technological aspects of WMF. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6654-1991"], "LastName": "Alexandre", "ForeName": "Allana Patr\u00edcia Santos", "Initials": "APS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0620-8545"], "LastName": "Castanha", "ForeName": "Nanci", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "Naiara Silva", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Amanda Silva", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Food, Federal University of Rio Grande, Rio Grande, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4079-8753"], "LastName": "Badiale-Furlong", "ForeName": "Eliana", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Nutrition Research Center (NAPAN), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7435-343X"], "LastName": "Augusto", "ForeName": "Pedro Esteves Duarte", "Initials": "PED"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agri-food Industry, Food and Nutrition (LAN), Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Piracicaba, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2764-4706"], "LastName": "Calori-Domingues", "ForeName": "Maria Antonia", "Initials": "MA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "401004/2014-7", "Agency": "Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "306557/2017-7", "Agency": "Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2016/17741-1", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2016/10732-7", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2016/22638-5", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "APS Alexandre N.
