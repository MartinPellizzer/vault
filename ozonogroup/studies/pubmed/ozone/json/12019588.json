The pulp mills had previously used chlorine dioxide as the bleaching agent. Testings included spirometry, methacholine challenge testing, and questionnaires. Area samplings showed sporadic ozone levels exceeding 0.9 ppm.", "There was a greater prevalence of wheezing (25%) among the bleachery workers with a history of gassings (from ozone, chlorine, or sulfur dioxide) than among those without gassings (18%) and among the referents (13%). Among the current smokers the fraction with a slightly increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was greater among the bleachery workers reporting gassings than among those that had not been gassed. For the period from 1992 to 1996, when the mills were using ozone, there was an increased incidence rate of wheezing among the workers in the bleachery (incidence rate ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.6-5.8).", "Repeated exposure to irritants increases the risk of asthma-like symptoms. This finding reinforces the view that repeated peak exposures to irritants must be prevented in pulp mills."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.
