Overall, the coupled simulation results exhibited good agreement with the observations for meteorological fields and air quality (fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)) compared to those obtained using the non-coupled simulation. The coupling effect in the study area tended to be strong in the presence of relatively strong winds (\u22654\u00a0m\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>). The mean contributions of natural marine (DMS and SSA) and biogenic emissions to total PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass reached ~8.2\u00a0% over the marine area and\u00a0~\u00a09.1\u00a0% over the land area, respectively. On average, biogenic emissions contributed 8.6\u00a0%, 29.3\u00a0% (and 27.3\u00a0%) to the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (and organic carbon (OC)), respectively, over the land area. Isoprene and monoterpene contributed 40\u00a0% and 20\u00a0%, respectively, to biogenic SOA production over the land area and biogenic SOA accounted for 1.7\u00a0% and 7.8\u00a0% of the total O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, respectively. Secondary aerosol formation was enhanced by gas-to-particle conversion processes due to the coupling effect. Therefore, this modeling study confirmed the non-negligible impact of natural emissions on the air quality in the study area. In addition, the study area is likely to be associated with VOC-limited conditions because of significantly enhanced photochemical O<sub>3</sub> production owing to biogenic emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
