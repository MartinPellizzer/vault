In this study, we estimated the premature deaths attributed to ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from 2015 to 2100 under four socioeconomic climate scenarios based on an age-stratified assessment method. We found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> will decrease in all shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios and O<sub>3</sub> will decrease in the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios, contributing to a decrease in premature mortality together with the declining total population in China. However, the benefits of a decline in population size and PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over time will be largely offset by population aging, and premature death caused by PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> will continue to rise till 2060-2080. This impact was greater for the O<sub>3</sub>-related deaths than those for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Our study highlights the importance of future prevention strategies that must jointly improve air quality and susceptibility to aging."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
