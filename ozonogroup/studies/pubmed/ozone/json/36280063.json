In reality, high temperature does not occur alone in environment, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and heatwaves usually co-exist in atmospheric environment. However, whether O<sub>3</sub> exposure exacerbates HS-induced cognitive impairment and the potential underlying mechanisms have not been explored experimentally. The aim of this study was to determine the co-effects and mechanisms of HS and O<sub>3</sub> on the cognitive dysfunction.", "48 Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, HS, O<sub>3</sub> and HS plus O<sub>3</sub> (HO<sub>3</sub>) groups. Rats in HS and HO<sub>3</sub> group were exposed to 40 \u00b0C every morning from 9:00 to 12:00 for 15 consecutive days. While rats in O<sub>3</sub> and HO<sub>3</sub> groups were exposed to 0.7 ppm O<sub>3</sub> the same day from 14:00 to 17:00 for 15 days. Cognitive performance was examined with Morris water maze test. Neurodegeneration, glial activation, neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and apoptosis were evaluated by Western blot, Elisa, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining.", "HS induced cognitive decline and neuronal damage in rats. Further studies showed that exposure of rats to HS could also induce glial activation, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus, and decrease in the expressions of ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding, indicative of BBB disruption. Impressively, the neuronal effects induced by HS, as depicted above, could be worsened by co-exposure to O<sub>3</sub> in rats.", "Co-exposure to O<sub>3</sub> promotes HS-induced cognitive impairment in rats possibly through glial-mediated neuroinflammation and BBB disruption."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
