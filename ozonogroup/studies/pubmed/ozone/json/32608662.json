The concentrations of VOCs in the Jinnan District of Tianjin were monitored by the Syntech Spectras GC955 online monitoring system, and the ozone generation potential of VOCs was calculated by the maximum incremental activity factor. The results showed that the total concentration of VOCs in the Jinnan District was (32.33\u00b123.77) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, in which the mass concentration of alkane was the highest, and propylene, ethylene and toluene had the highest mass concentration. During the observation period, the ozone formation potential (OFP) of TVOC was 107.81 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the contribution of alkenes to OFP was the largest, which was 55.80%. Ethylene, isoprene, and toluene accounted for the first three places of OFP contribution rate. The backward trajectory analysis showed that TVOC and its OFPs were different under different trajectories. The estimation of VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> volume fraction ratio showed that O<sub>3</sub> formation was sensitive to VOCs, which showed that atmospheric photochemical pollution has a considerable degree of regional characteristics. The concentration ratio of ethylbenzene/<i>m,p</i>-xylene, and ethane/acetylene can be used to measure the progress of atmospheric chemical reaction and photochemical age in the air mass, which was proved by the aging process of VOC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Institute of Meteorological Science, Tianjin 300074."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Su-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ambient Air Particulate Pollution Prevention and Control, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Fen", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ambient Air Particulate Pollution Prevention and Control, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jia", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608662", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201908078"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
