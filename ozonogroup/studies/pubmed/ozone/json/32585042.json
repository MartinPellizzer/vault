Several air pollutants, including volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, toluene, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ), and particulate matter, act as risk factors for the development or aggravation of atopic dermatitis (AD). We evaluated the impact of air pollutants and weather changes on AD patients.", "Sixty AD patients \u22655\u00a0years of age (mean age: 23.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0years), living in the Campania Region (Southern Italy), were followed for 18\u00a0months. The primary outcome was the effect of atmospheric and climatic factors on signs and symptoms of AD, assessed using the SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) index. We measured mean daily temperature (TOD), outdoor relative humidity (RH), diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation, particulate with aerodynamic diameter\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub> ), NO<sub>2</sub> , tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ), and total pollen count (TPC). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations of AD signs and symptoms with these factors. An artificial neural network (ANN) analysis investigated the relationships between weather changes, environmental pollutants, and AD severity.", "The severity of AD symptoms was positively correlated with outdoor temperatures (TOD, DTR), RH, precipitation, PM<sub>10</sub> , NO<sub>2</sub> , O<sub>3</sub> , and TPC. The ANN analysis also showed a good discrimination performance (75.46%) in predicting disease severity based on environmental pollution data, but weather-related factors were less predictive.", "The results of the present study provide evidence that weather changes and air pollutions have a significant impact on skin reactivity and symptoms in AD patients, increasing the severity of the dermatitis. The knowledge of the single variables proportion on AD severity symptoms is important to propose alerts for exacerbations in patients with AD of each age. This finding represents a good starting point for further future research in an area of increasingly growing interest."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5640-6446"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine ASL Salerno, \"Santa Maria della Speranza\" Hospital, Salerno, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Patella", "ForeName": "Vincenzo", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine ASL Salerno, \"Santa Maria della Speranza\" Hospital, Salerno, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Florio", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Former Primary of Unit of Pediatry, Hospital of Eboli, Salerno, Italy."}], "LastName": "Palmieri", "ForeName": "Mario", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MACVIA-France and University Hospital, Montpellier, France."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Berlin Institute of Health, Comprehensive Allergy Center, Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "Bousquet", "ForeName": "Jean", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Physiology-National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Tonacci", "ForeName": "Alessandro", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology Analysis, Department for the Treatment of Addictions, ASL Salerno, Salerno, Italy."}], "LastName": "Giuliano", "ForeName": "Ada", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School and Unit of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gangemi", "ForeName": "Sebastiano", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pediatr Allergy Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9106718", "ISSNLinking": "0905-6157"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Hassoun Y, James C, Bernstein DI.
