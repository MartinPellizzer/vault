This is the first time to study the spatial and temporal variations of criteria pollutants in Beijing using hourly observational data from 12 sites between June 2014 and May 2015 released by the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) of China. Beijing is facing tremendous air pollution as the daily averaged PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00b5m) concentrations in all sites exceeding the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) Grade I & II standards (15 and 35\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). Slightly differences in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were observed between sites at the urban and rural areas. Pearson correlation coefficients show that most pollutants are temporally correlated in Beijing except for O<sub>3</sub>. The coefficients of divergence (COD) indicate that PM<sub>2.5</sub> is associated at most sites with only one rural site (Dingling) having observable difference and one site may be insufficient for monitoring surrounding area. The 8h peak O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) also correlates at different sites but with one urban site (Haidianquwanliu) different from others. In addition, an extreme PM<sub>2.5</sub> event (hourly average concentration exceeding 300\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for ~40h) was examined with the consideration of meteorological conditions. Southerly wind with low speed and high relative humidity allow the accumulation of pollutants while northerly wind with high speed and low relative humidity result in good air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
