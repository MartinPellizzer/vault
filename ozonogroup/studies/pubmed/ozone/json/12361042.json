Three types of experiments were conducted: anaerobic digestion, aerobic biodegradation, and denitrification using ozone-treated sludge as a carbon source. For 5 days, ozonated sludge at 0.1 gO3/g-SS showed about 2-3 times greater biodegradation compared to the raw sludge in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In anaerobic experiments, biodegradation increased with ozone dosage up to 0.2 gO3/g-SS. Further increase of ozone dosage did not improve the biodegradation. In aerobic condition, about 77% of the ozonated sludge at 0.1 gO3/g-SS could be biodegraded after 15 days and is compared with 36% degradation of the untreated sludge. Most of the biodegradation of the ozonated sludge occurred within 5 days while the raw sludge was biodegraded steadily throughout the experimental period. The biodegradation enhancement of ozonated sludge was confirmed in batch denitrification experiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engr, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea. yeom@skku.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeom", "ForeName": "I T", "Initials": "IT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Aerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12361042"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
