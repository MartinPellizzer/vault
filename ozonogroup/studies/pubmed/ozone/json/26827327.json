For oxide MBE growth, pure ozone delivery to the chamber has been made available, and several new deposition sources have been made available on a new 12 in. CF (ConFlat, a registered trademark of Varian, Inc.) flange. X-ray diffraction has been used as a major probe for film growth and structures for the system. In the original design, electron diffraction was intended for the secondary diagnostics available without the necessity of the x-ray and located at separate positions. Deposition of films was made possible at the two diagnostic positions. And, the aiming of the evaporation sources is fixed to the point between two locations. Ozone can be supplied through two separate nozzles for each location. Also two separate thickness monitors are installed. Additional features of the equipment are also presented together with the data taken during typical oxide film growth to illustrate the depth of information available via in situ x-ray techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Tung", "ForeName": "I C", "Initials": "IC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "S-H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Freeland", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Hawoong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Sci Instrum", "NlmUniqueID": "0405571", "ISSNLinking": "0034-6748"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26827327", "10.1063/1.4939100"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
