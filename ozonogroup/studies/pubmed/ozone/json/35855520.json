While O<sub>3</sub> control is challenging, tracking underlying formation mechanisms provides insights for regulatory directions. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the effects of changing emissions on O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanisms with observational evidence. We present a new approach that provides a quantitative metric for the ozone production rate (OPR) and its sensitivity to precursor levels by interpreting two decades of in situ observations of the six criteria air pollutants(2001-2018). Applying to the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB), California, we show that by 2016-2018, the basin was at the transition region between nitrogen oxide (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>)-limited and volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited chemical regimes. Assuming future weather conditions are similar to 2016-2018, we predict that NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-focused reduction is required to reduce the number of summer days the SoCAB is in violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (70 ppbv) for O<sub>3</sub>. Roughly, \u223c40% (\u223c60%) NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reductions are required to reduce the OPR by \u223c1.8 ppb/h (\u223c3.3 ppb/h). This change would reduce the number of violation days from 28 to 20% (10%) in a year, mostly in summertime. Concurrent VOC reductions which reduce the production rate of HO<sub><i>x</i></sub> radicals would also be beneficial."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0333-6277"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju 61005, Korea."}], "LastName": "Perdigones", "ForeName": "Begie C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju 61005, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Soojin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6617-7691"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Cohen", "ForeName": "Ronald C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climate and Air Quality Research Department, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon 22689, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jeong-Hoo", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju 61005, Korea."}], "LastName": "Min", "ForeName": "Kyung-Eun", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35855520", "10.1021/acs.est.2c01026"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
