Catalytic activity in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) removal followed the order of La<sub>0.8</sub>Ce<sub>0.2</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0La<sub>0.4</sub>Ce<sub>0.6</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0La<sub>0.6</sub>Ce<sub>0.4</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0La<sub>0.2</sub>Ce<sub>0.8</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0LaFeO<sub>3</sub> with 77, 66, 61, 60 and 56% respectively. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by diffraction of X-ray (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Moreover, electron spin resonance (ESR) and radicals quenching experiments showed that the active oxygen species in the ozone decomposition process are mainly hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), and also include superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, the superior activity of La<sub>0.8</sub>Ce<sub>0.2</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> could be attributed to the higher surface area, the richer lattice oxygen, richer surface -OH groups and the facilitated redox Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> cycling. In addition, this study provides an insight to use metal-doped perovskite catalysts for catalytic ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
