We have also compared the activities of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate cycle and a typical marker of oxidant injury, to assess whether ODC can serve as a sensitive marker of O3 effects on the lung. We exposed 90-day-old male specific-pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats to either 0.45 +/- 0.05 ppm (882 +/- 98 micrograms/m3) O3 or filtered room air continuously for 3 days. After exposure, the rats were terminated and the lungs examined for enzyme activities, polyamine contents, DNA content, and 3H-TdR incorporation. We found that in exposed rats, the enzyme activities were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) relative to air controls. G6PD, 25%, ODC, 147%, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMet DC), 86%. Polyamine contents were also affected by O3; putrescine increased 80%, p less than 0.05, spermidine did not change, and spermine decreased 23%, p less than 0.05. 3H-TdR incorporation into DNA was significantly elevated, 155%, p less than 0.001, after O3 exposure while total lung DNA content remained unchanged. The concomitant and large increase in ODC activity (reflecting polyamine metabolism) and DNA labeling (reflecting DNA synthesis and/or repair), indicates a strong correlation between the two and suggests that polyamine metabolism may play an important role in the accelerated cell proliferation associated with O3 injury. Moreover, the greater increase in lung ODC activity compared to other enzymes offers a sensitive marker of the lung response to inhaled O3. We conclude that inhalation of O3 at levels similar to what may be encountered during some smog episodes can result in significant pulmonary biochemical alterations with a potential for long-term consequences. The possible association between ODC activity and DNA labeling may offer a new insight into the mechanism of tissue injury and repair. We also speculate that the changes in lung polyamines may reflect antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions associated with the cellular defense against oxidant injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles 90024."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsayed", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ellingson", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tierney", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-27309", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10028-17-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tritium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VC2W18DGKR", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tritium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2296762", "10.1016/0041-008x(90)90078-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
