In general, short-term exposure to sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub> ) promotes stomatal opening, whereas longer-term exposure can cause partial stomatal closure. By contrast, the effects of oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub> ) are often small or insignificant. The effects of ozone, and oxidative stress, are equally complex. Short-term exposure to ozone stimulates a rapid reduction in stomatal aperture, whilst longer-term exposure causes stomatal responses to become sluggish. The response of stomata to abscisic acid (ABA) has been shown to be slower in plants exposed to a combination of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> suggesting an adverse effect on guard cell ABA signal transduction. In addition, ozone causes a reduction in stomatal closure under drought conditions. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that air pollutants and oxidative stresses can have a marked effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis of guard cells and the intracellular machinery responsible for stomatal movements. Here we discuss the effects of air pollutants on stomatal responses and their possible effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> based signalling in guard cells focusing on the effects of ozone and oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McAinsh", "ForeName": "Martin R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Nicky H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montgomery", "ForeName": "Lucy T", "Initials": "LT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "North", "ForeName": "Kathryn A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Allen GJ, Kwak JM, Chu SP, Llopis J, Tsien RY, Harper JF, Schroeder JI. 1999.
