The protocol for ozone/oxygen mixture therapy appointments was set as twice a week for 10 weeks, for a total of 20 applications for each patient. The evaluation of the lesions was based on the clinical and radiologic parameters. The primary outcome was the necrotic lesion reduction during ozone/oxygen therapy sessions and up to the end of follow up periods. The healing of the lesion was taken as a positive result. The level of significance was taken as p <0.05.", "A total of 14 patients affected by osteonecrosis were included. The mean follow-up of the patients was 14.3 months.
