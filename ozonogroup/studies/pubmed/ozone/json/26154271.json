Structurally similar but larger ELVOC (extremely low volatility organic compound) products formed from autoxidation of monoterpenes are believed to play a major role in the formation and early growth of atmospheric aerosol particles. Utilizing density functional theory geometries, with a DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP single point energy correction, the stepwise Gibbs free energies of formation have been calculated, and the stabilities of the molecular clusters have been evaluated. C6H8O7 interacts weakly with both itself and sulfuric acid, with standard free energies of formation (\u0394G at 298 K and 1 atm) around or above 0 kcal/mol. This is due to the presence of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the peroxyacid groups of C6H8O7. These stabilize the isolated molecule with respect to its clusters, and lead to unfavorable interaction energies. The addition of sulfuric acid to clusters containing C6H8O7 is somewhat more favorable, but the formed clusters are still far more likely to evaporate than to grow further in atmospheric conditions. These findings indicate that the O/C ratio cannot exclusively be used as a proxy for volatility in atmospheric new particle formation involving organic compounds. The specific molecular structure, and especially the number of strong hydrogen binding moieties, are equally important. The interaction between the C6H8O7 compound and aqueous phase sulfate ions indicates that ELVOC-type compounds can contribute to aerosol mass by effectively partitioning into the condensed phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Physics and \u2021Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Elm", "ForeName": "Jonas", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Physics and \u2021Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Myllys", "ForeName": "Nanna", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Physics and \u2021Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Hyttinen", "ForeName": "Noora", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Physics and \u2021Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Kurt\u00e9n", "ForeName": "Theo", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26154271", "10.1021/acs.jpca.5b04040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
