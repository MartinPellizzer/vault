The MNC initial concentration of the solution was set in the range of 2-20 mg/L to investigate NDMA formation during MNC ozonation. Four ozone doses (22.5, 37.2, 58.0, and 74.4 mg/min) were tested to study the effect of ozone dose. For the evaluation of effects of pH value, pH was adjusted from 5 to 9 in the presence of phosphate buffer. MNC ozonation experiments were also conducted in natural water to assess the influence of water matirx. The influence of the typical component of natural water was also investigated with the addition of HA and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution. Results indicated that ozone was effective in MNC removal. Consequently, NDMA and dimethylamine (DMA) were generated from MNC oxidation. Increasing pH value enhanced MNC removal but led to greater NDMA generation. Water matrices, such as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and humic acid, affected MNC degradation. Conversely, more NDMA accumulated due to the inhibition of NDMA oxidation by oxidant consumption. Though \u22c5OH can enhance MNC degradation, ozone molecules were heavily involved in NDMA production. Seven transformation products were identified. However, only DMA and the unidentified tertiary amine containing DMA group contributed to NDMA formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse , College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse , College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong M", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ARQ8157E0Q", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FYY3R43WGO", "NameOfSubstance": "Minocycline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Minocycline"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29405834", "10.1080/10934529.2018.1429724"]}}]}
