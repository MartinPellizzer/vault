Coking wastewater is one of coal chemical wastewater, which contains various refractory organic pollutants. To meet the more and more rigorous discharge standard and increase the reuse ratio of coking wastewater, advanced treatment process must be set for treating the biologically treated coking wastewater. To date, several advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including Fenton, ozone, persulfate-based oxidation, and iron-carbon micro-electrolysis, have been applied for the advanced treatment of coking wastewater. However, the performance of different advanced treatment processes changed greatly, depending on the components of coking wastewater and the unique characteristics of advanced treatment processes. In this review article, the state-of-the-art advanced treatment process of coking wastewater was systematically summarized and analyzed. Firstly, the major organic pollutants in the secondary effluents of coking wastewater was briefly introduced, to better understand the characteristics of the biologically treated coking wastewater. Then, the performance of various advanced treatment processes, including physiochemical methods, biological methods, advanced oxidation methods and combined methods were discussed for the advanced treatment of coking wastewater in detail. Finally, the conclusions and remarks were provided. This review will be helpful for the proper selection of advanced treatment processes and promote the development of advanced treatment processes for coking wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
