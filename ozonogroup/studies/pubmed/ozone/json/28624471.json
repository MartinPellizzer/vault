However, the mechanisms underlying these ozone exacerbation effects are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the exacerbation effect of ozone in OVA-induced asthma mice and tried to demonstrate the protective mechanism of vitamin E (VE). An asthma mouse model was established, and used to identify the exacerbating effects of ozone by assessing cytokine and serum immunoglobulin concentrations, airway leukocyte infiltration, histopathological changes in lung tissues, and airway hyper-responsiveness. We then determined the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated, the extent to which VE induced ROS elimination, and examined the antagonistic effects of VE on the ozone-induced exacerbating effects. This study showed that 1-ppm ozone exposure could exacerbate OVA-induced asthma in mice. More importantly we found that ozone induced oxidative stress in asthmatic airways may lead to the inhibition of Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and may subsequently induce even more exaggerated oxidative stress associated with asthma exacerbation. Through VE induced Nrf2 activation and the subsequent increase in Nrf2 target protein expression, this study suggests a novel mechanism for alleviating ozone exacerbated asthma symptoms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
