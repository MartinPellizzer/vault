Changes in COD, UV absorption at 254 nm (UVA254) and BOD content were measured during and after ozonation, and the ozone utilisation efficiency at different conditions was calculated. The initial COD concentration was found to influence the absolute removal of UVA254 significantly, but especially changes in pH influenced the ozone reactions. Increased pH (pH 10) most probably increased the overall hydroxyl radical production leading to a higher COD removal and a much better ozone utilisation compared to lower pH. This in contrast to initial COD variations which had little influence on the determined ozone utilisation. Regardless of initial COD content or pH, on average 10% of the initial COD content was converted to BOD, next to 10% COD that was removed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chys", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oloibiri", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Audenaert", "ForeName": "W T M", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Langenhove", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Demeestere", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Hulle", "ForeName": "S W H", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101200320", "ISSNLinking": "1379-1176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25864321"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
