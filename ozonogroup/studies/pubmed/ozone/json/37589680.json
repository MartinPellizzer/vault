Although this is being addressed continuously, the device performance has not improved further due to the use of PEDOT:PSS as the hole-transport material (HTM), which has poor long-term stability. Herein we have applied commercial ITO nanoparticles over ITO glass substrates and altered the surface chemistry of the ITO electrode via a simple two-step thermal annealing, followed by a UV-ozone treatment. These surface-modified ITO electrodes display promising interfacial characteristics, such as a suitable band alignment owing to significantly reduced surface carbon contamination, increased In-O bonding, and reduced oxygen vacancies, that enabled fabrication of an HTM-free TPSC device according to a two-step method. The fabricated device possessed an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7%, along with a superior long-term stability by retaining over 90% of the initial PCE upon shelf storage in a glovebox for a period of over 10000 h. The application of ITO nanoparticles led to effective interfacial passivation, whose impacts on the long-term durability were assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence decay profiles, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9377-2963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta-Hseuh Rd., Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Rajamanickam", "ForeName": "Parameswaran", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4893-9204"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry and Institute of Molecular Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta-Hseuh Rd., Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Emergent Functional Matter Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta-Hseuh Rd., Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Narra", "ForeName": "Sudhakar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4417-8631"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry and Institute of Molecular Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta-Hseuh Rd., Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Seetharaman", "ForeName": "Ashank", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6113-5679"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry and Institute of Molecular Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta-Hseuh Rd., Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Emergent Functional Matter Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 1001 Ta-Hseuh Rd., Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Diau", "ForeName": "Eric Wei-Guang", "Initials": "EW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37589680", "10.1021/acsami.3c10268"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
