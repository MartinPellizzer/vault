The ammonium removal pathways and microbial community in the GSFs were investigated. The concentrations of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen were monitored along the filter. Total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) loss occurred during the filtration. For 1 mg ammonium removal, the TIN loss was as high as 0.35 mg, DO consumption was 3.06 mg, and alkalinity consumption was 5.55 mg. It was assumed that both nitrification and denitrification processes occur in the filters to fit the TIN loss and low DO consumption. During the filtration, nitritation, nitrification and nitritation-anaerobic ammonium oxidation processes probably occur, while traditional nitrification and denitrification and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes may occur. In the GSFs, Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira are likely to be involved in nitrification processes, while Novosphingobium, Comamonadaceae and Oxalobacteraceae may be involved in denitrification processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. fengs07@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Shuguang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaojian", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhiyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Xiaobin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23520865", "10.1016/s1001-0742(11)60965-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
