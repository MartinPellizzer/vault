In this study, we investigated the exposure status of ozone pollution and the temperature distribution in an air-conditioned bus in Jinan during the evening peak period based on field measurements obtained with a handheld portable particle counter and indigo disulfonate spectrophotometry. Statistical analysis showed that the passengers experienced poor air quality within the confines of the bus due to the poor air quality outside. Furthermore, the level of passenger comfort was dissatisfactory because of the high temperature, thereby highlighting the urgent need to improve the current situation. Numerical simulations were conducted using FLUENT software to explore the impacts of the air supply angle, the opening and closing of the bus door, and the chemical reaction between ozone and its precursors on the diffusion and distribution of ozone, the temperature, and the airflow field. The results indicated that high concentrations of ozone were present in the middle and front regions of the bus. Pollution can be reduced by keeping the bus door open for no longer than 20\u00a0s when waiting for other passengers, and the best optimization effect in relation to the temperature and passenger comfort was determined as an air supply angle of 30\u00b0. In addition, the average individual daily intake of ozone was combined with other relevant parameters to assess the exposure level. It is recommended that the elderly and children should avoid peak time travel to reduce their exposure to ozone (inhalation dose values >\u200960\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and >\u200956\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> according to simulations, respectively). These findings are expected to effectively improve the air quality and passenger comfort levels in busses, thereby protecting the health of passengers and reducing carbon usage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Power and Energy Engineering, Shandong University, P.O.
