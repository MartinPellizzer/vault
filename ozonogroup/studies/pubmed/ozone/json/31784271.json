Exploring the synoptic impacts and quantifying the source contributions are important for mitigating O<sub>3</sub> pollution. This study focuses on the summertime O<sub>3</sub> pollution over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in eastern China. We identify six predominant synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) over the YRD during 2013-2017 using the self-organising map (SOM) approach. We conduct O<sub>3</sub> source attribution based on ozone source apportionment technology (OSAT) in a regional transport model. Surface O<sub>3</sub> pollution is found to be sensitive to the predominant SWPs, including four O<sub>3</sub>-polluted types (northeasterly, northerly and southwesterly and anticyclone) and two O<sub>3</sub>-clean types (cyclone and the Meiyu front). The integrated influences of local chemistry and regional transport are important in O<sub>3</sub> pollution under different SWPs. Daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> holds strong negative and positive correlations with relative humidity and sunshine duration, respectively. Among the six SWPs, the concentration and exceedance of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> reach their maxima under the northerly type on a regional average. Higher O<sub>3</sub> levels, particularly under the northerly and northeasterly types, are primarily related to regional transport on various spatial scales. Local production accounts for the largest proportion of O<sub>3</sub> sources under the anticyclone type. Under the southwesterly type, favourable weather conditions superimposed on regional transport lead to severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution in coastal cities. The impact of super-regional transport is most pronounced along the eastern coast under the cyclone type. Source category analysis shows that transportation and industrial emissions play a prime role in surface O<sub>3</sub> formation. This study illustrates the imperative implementation of joint emission control over eastern China to reduce O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
