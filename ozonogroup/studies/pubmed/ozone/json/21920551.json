Osteomyelitis was induced by a bone injection of 10(8) CFU/mL methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. HBO was administered daily at 2.8-atm pressure for 90 min; O(3) therapy was provided as intraperitoneal injections of 0.7 mg/kg O(3)/O(2) gas mixture once daily. Treatments were continued from d 7 to 21 after induction of osteomyelitis. Bone tissues and blood samples were harvested for biochemical, histopathologic, and microbiologic analyses.", "Rats in the sham, VO, and VOHB groups gained weight but those in the control, V, and VHB groups did not. Levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were lower in the VHB, VO, and VOHB groups than in V and control groups. Levels of interleukin-10 and -1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were decreased in the VHB, VO, and VOHB groups; transforming growth factor-\u03b2 was increased in these groups compared with V and control groups (P \u2264 0.001). Bacteria counts in VOHB were significantly lower than those in group of V (P = 0.012). Histopathologic scores in group VO were significantly lower than those in group V (P = 0.046).", "O(3) was as effective as HBO in decreasing oxidative parameters and inflammatory cytokines.
