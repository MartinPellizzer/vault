Two visible-light absorption bands appear in the visible spectra obtained for O<sub>3</sub>-THT and O<sub>3</sub>-PyD, whereas four bands are observed for O<sub>3</sub>-TAD, which contains both N and S atoms in the heterocyclic ring. Upon visible-light irradiation, O<sub>3</sub>-THT and O<sub>3</sub>-PyD form their corresponding oxide derivatives, tetrahydrothiophene-1-oxide and pyrrolidine-<i>N</i>-oxide. Although two O<sub>3</sub>-TAD complexes with different photoreactivities are detected, both structures form thiazolidine-1-oxide upon combining with O and S atom in the heterocyclic ring, but not thiazolidine-<i>N</i>-oxide. The mechanism of formation of these oxide compounds can be explained by the stability of the oxide compound in the triplet state formed via the combination of O(<sup>3</sup>P) and the paired ring molecule."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kon", "ForeName": "Asami", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Inano", "ForeName": "Natsuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Terada", "ForeName": "Nariko", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kamata", "ForeName": "Kentaro", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5722-4596"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Akai", "ForeName": "Nobuyuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of BASE (Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering), Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakata", "ForeName": "Munetaka", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "27"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33689327", "10.1021/acs.jpca.1c00280"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
