Advanced treatment methods including ozonation and granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption were tested to remove microcystins from drinking water. The results indicated that, when containing high level of algae in raw water, preoxidation at 2 mg/L of ClO2 was not enough to stop algae growth in long distance transportation. In the water plant studied, both coagulation and filtration caused significant increase instead of removal of microcystins in drinking water. Chlorine disinfection removed part of microcystins. However, both ozonation and GAC adsorption were able to remove microcystins completely, thereby improving the quality of drinking water in terms of microcystins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Engineering and Management, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X H", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Z S", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "77238-39-2", "NameOfSubstance": "microcystin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14672321", "10.1081/ese-120025837"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
