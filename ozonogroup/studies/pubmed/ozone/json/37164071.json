If also toxic (PMT) or very persistent and very mobile (vPvM) their regulation under REACH as substances of very high concern is foreseen. Yet, knowledge on the effectiveness of advanced wastewater treatment in removing PM-substances from WWTP effluents is limited to few rather well-known chemicals. The occurrence and behavior of 111 suspected and known PM-substances was investigated in two wastewater treatment plants employing either powdered activated carbon (PAC, full-scale) or ozonation with subsequent sand/anthracite filtration (pilot-scale) and an additional granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration was investigated. 72 of the 111 PM-substances analyzed were detected at least once in the secondary effluent of either wastewater treatment plant, resulting in total concentrations of 104\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively. While PAC removed 32\u00a0% of PM-substances well, the total PM burden in the effluent was only reduced from 103\u00a0\u03bcg/L to 87\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Ozonation and the subsequent sand/anthracite filtration was able to reduce the PM burden in wastewater from 40\u00a0\u03bcg/L to 19\u00a0\u03bcg/L, showing a higher removal efficacy than PAC in this study. The additional GAC filtration further reduced the total PM-concentration to 13\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Among the investigated PM-chemicals detected were constituents of ionic liquids: The anion hexafluorophosphate was one of few chemicals that was detected in effluent concentrations >1\u00a0\u03bcg/L and could not be removed by the processes studied, showing that for some chemicals preventive actions may be required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
