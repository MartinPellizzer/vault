However, whether AM symbiosis decreases plant O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity and what the underlying mechanisms are remain unclear. In this study, O<sub>3</sub>-tolerant poplar clone 107 and O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive poplar clone 546 were used as test plants. An open-top chamber experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of AM inoculation on plant growth and physiological parameters under O<sub>3</sub> enrichment. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> enrichment significantly decreased plant biomass and net photosynthetic rate and increased the leaf shedding rate and malondialdehyde concentration of clone 546. Generally, clone 107 was less responsive to O<sub>3</sub> enrichment than clone 546 was. Differences in antioxidant enzyme activity, rather than in specific leaf weight or stomatal conductance, were responsible for the differences in O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity between the two clones. AM inoculation significantly increased the biomass and decreased the leaf shedding rate and malondialdehyde concentration of clone 107 but had no significant effect on almost all the indexes of clone 546, suggesting a species-specific mycorrhizal effect on plant O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity. Mechanistically, AM symbiosis did not significantly affect nutrient uptake, stomatal conductance, or specific leaf weight of poplar but did significantly increase antioxidant enzyme activity. Linear regression analysis of antioxidant enzyme activities and the effect of O<sub>3</sub> on growth and physiological parameters showed that AM symbiosis mediated antioxidant enzyme activities to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> injury to the two poplar clones. This study improved the understanding of the protective effects of AM fungi on plants against O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
