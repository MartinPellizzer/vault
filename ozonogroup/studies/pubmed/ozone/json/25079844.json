Coagulation and oxidation of biological wastewater treatment effluent have been applied for the fouling control of microfiltration membranes. However, the change in EfOM structure by pre-treatments has not been clearly identified. The changes of EfOM characteristics induced by coagulation and ozonation were investigated through size exclusion chromatography, UV/Vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrophotometry and titrimetric analysis to identify the mechanisms in the reduction of ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling. The results indicated that reduction of flux decline by coagulation was due to modified characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. Total concentration of DOC was not reduced by ozonation. However, the mass fraction of the molecules with molecular weight larger than 5 kDa, fluorescence intensity, aromaticity, highly condensed chromophores, average molecular weight and soluble microbial byproducts decreased greatly after ozonation. These results indicated that EfOM was partially oxidized by ozonation to low molecular weight, highly charged compounds with abundant electron-withdrawing functional groups, which are favourable for alleviating UF membrane flux decline."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
