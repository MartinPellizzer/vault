However, eosinophilic airways inflammation has also been observed subsequent to ambient ozone exposure.", "For a population sample of 877 children living at nine sites with different ozone exposure we measured urinary eosinophil protein X (U-EPX) as a marker of eosinophil activation. U-EPX was determined from a single spot urine sample during autumn 1997. Children were participants in a longitudinal study of ozone effects on lung function.", "The 5-95% percentiles of ozone exposure (30-day mean before test) were 11.8-51.5 p.p.b. (mean: 31.6 ppb). U-EPX was measured by radioimmunoassay and expressed as ratio to urinary creatinine (microg EPX/mmol creatinine). Log transformation was performed to achieve a normal distribution. LogU-EPX was associated with gender, a diagnosis of asthma and atopy (skin test sensitivity to any of seven aeroallergens). LogU-EPX increased with ozone exposure for all children. The medians of LogU-EPX according to the first-fourth quartiles of ozone exposure were: 1.82, 1.88, 1.95 and 2.03. For 172 non-asthmatic children who had spent the whole summer at their site corresponding figures were 1.57, 1.78, 2.07 and 2.13. In a multivariate model with logU-EPX being the dependent variable and adjusted for gender, site and atopy, ozone was found to be significant (estimate: 0.007 microg/mmol creatinine per ppb ozone; SE:0.02; P < 0.001).", "Our observation supports the hypothesis that ozone in healthy children is associated with eosinophil inflammation, most likely in the airways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Children's Hospital Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frischer", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Studnicka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Halmerbauer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horak", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gartner", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tauber", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koller", "ForeName": "D Y", "Initials": "DY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "8906443", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribonucleases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Ribonucleases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11529890", "10.1046/j.1365-2222.2001.01155.x", "cea1155"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
