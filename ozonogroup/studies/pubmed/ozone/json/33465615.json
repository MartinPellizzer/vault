The distrupted interspecies competition is one of the primary causes driving the plankton community composition shifts under UVB stress. To reveal the competitive responses to enhanced UVB radiation, we grew two green algae Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and the unicellular cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in monocultures and in cocultures under differerent UVB intensities (0, 0.3 and 0.7\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>), respectively. Results showed that elevated UVB radiation consistently decreased the population carrying capacies and the photosynthesis of the three species in monocultures. While cocultivated, C.\u00a0pyrenoidosa was competively excluded by the presence of S.\u00a0obliquus, and the competitive outcome was not affected by UVB exposure. By contrast, unicellular M.\u00a0aeruginosa overwhelmingly suppressed the population growth of S.\u00a0obliquus under no UVB, yet S.\u00a0obliquus tended to be a better competitor under 0.3-0.7\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> UVB exposure. The species-specific photosynthesis sensitivity to UVB can partly explain the different tolerance of the algae to UVB and the change of competition outcome under elevated UVB. The present study elucidated the potential role of increased UVB radiation in determining the competitions between phytoplankton species, contributing to the understanding of phytoplankton community shifts under enhanced UVB stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
