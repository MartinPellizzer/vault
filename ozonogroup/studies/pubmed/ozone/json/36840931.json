Herein, we combined interfacial extraction and sonic spray ionization mass spectrometry to study the oxidation reaction of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG) mediated by ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at/near the surface of a hung water droplet. On-line interfacial extraction and ionization provided a snapshot of the short-lived CIs. Experiments in which the content of water was varied provided evidence for the formation of CIs, which has not been previously observed. Capture experiments using 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline <i>N</i>-oxide (DMPO) indicated that CIs could be selectively characterized, and the extracted ion current (EICs) of CIs vs DMPO-CI adducts further confirmed the successful observation of CIs. Theoretical calculation suggested that surface ozonolysis of POPG was mainly mediated by <i>anti-</i>CI. These results open a new route for aqueous surface reactive species identification, and benefit toward the understanding of disease development associated with cell oxidative stress mediated by CIs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1147-1759"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yaqi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yuwei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yanxiao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9182-335X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai), Weihai 264209, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36840931", "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05472"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
