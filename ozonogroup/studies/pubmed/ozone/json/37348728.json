Several species worldwide are still in danger from pesticide residues, despite efforts to mitigate the adverse health effects of these pollutants. As agricultural output has increased and scientific understanding has advanced, new methods have emerged for degrading pesticide traces. The remarkable effectiveness of ozone as a broad-spectrum disinfectant and its potential to destroy pesticide residues have led to its widespread use as a residue-free method for improving soil quality, disinfecting food, and treating water, among other benefits. Ozone is cheap to manufacture, making it an affordable option for treating harmful pesticide residues. Its capacity to degrade pesticides without negatively impacting the environment has increased its adoption as a tool for cleaning up after pesticide use. This review extensively provides an overview of ozonation for pesticide residues removal in different settings and applications. Ozone treatment of pesticide residues in the soil, water and food is effective in removing pesticides residues. We highlight recent advances in methods of removing pesticide residues. We discuss several challenges related to the ozone treatment of pesticide residues. Whether used alone or in conjunction with other processes, ozone is highly effective at removing pesticide residues from the environment. Therefore, we recommend this holistic and environmentally friendly strategy to reduce pesticide residues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
