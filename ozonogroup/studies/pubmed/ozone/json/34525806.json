The ability to accurately predict their fate, in part, relies upon quantitative knowledge of the chemical and physical parameters associated with the total organic carbon (TOC), which includes both precursors and oxidation products that evolve in the atmosphere over short to long time scales. However, such knowledge, obtained via limited carbon closure experiments, has not been attained for complex anthropogenic emissions. Here we present the first comprehensive characterization of TOC in the atmospheric oxidation of organic vapors from light and heavy oil mixtures associated with oil sand operations. Despite the complexity of the investigated oil mixtures, we are able to achieve carbon closure (83-116%) within the uncertainties (\u00b120%), with the degree of the closure being dependent upon the vapor composition and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> levels. In contrast to biogenic precursors (e.g., \u03b1-pinene), the photochemical time scale required for a largely complete oxidation and evolution of chemical parameters is very long for the petrochemical vapors (i.e., \u223c7-10 days vs \u223c1 day), likely due to the lower initial precursor reactivity. This suggests that petrochemical emissions and their impacts are likely to extend further spatially than biogenic emissions, and retain more of their complex composition and reactivity for many days. The results of this work provide key parameters to regional models for further improving the representation of the chemical evolution of petrochemical emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2970-037X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen 5232, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wentzell", "ForeName": "Jeremy J B", "Initials": "JJB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0033-5313"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qifan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Leithead", "ForeName": "Amy", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Moussa", "ForeName": "Samar G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4828-0884"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Chong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-Meng", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3683-4595"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Liggio", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34525806", "10.1021/acs.est.1c02620"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
