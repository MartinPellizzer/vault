An unexpected high ozone destruction rate was observed when O<sub>2</sub>* was present in the system. The kinetic model developed for the oxygen nightglow on the terrestrial planets was adapted to interpret the detected temporal profiles of the ozone number density and the O<sub>2</sub>* emission intensities. It was deduced that the vibrationally excited singlet delta oxygen molecule O<sub>2</sub>(a<sup>1</sup>\u0394, \u03c5) formed in the secondary processes reacts efficiently with ozone in the process O<sub>2</sub>(a<sup>1</sup>\u0394, \u03c5 \u2265 3) + O<sub>3</sub> \u2192 2O<sub>2</sub> + O, and the rate constant of this process was estimated to be 3 \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. Ab initio calculations at the CASPT2(14, 12)/cc-pVTZ/U\u03c9B97XD/cc-pVTZ level of theory were applied to find the reaction pathway from the reactants to products on the O<sub>5</sub> potential energy surface. These calculations revealed that the O<sub>2</sub>(a<sup>1</sup>\u0394) + O<sub>3</sub> reaction is likely to proceed via singlet-triplet intersystem crossing exhibiting an energy barrier of 9.6 kcal/mol, which lies between two and three quanta of vibrational excitation of O<sub>2</sub>(a<sup>1</sup>\u0394), and hence, O<sub>2</sub>(a<sup>1</sup>\u0394, \u03c5) with \u03c5 \u2265 3 could rapidly react with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000000266306833"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lebedev Physical Institute, Samara 443011, Russia."}], "LastName": "Pershin", "ForeName": "Andrey A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000344549903"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lebedev Physical Institute, Samara 443011, Russia."}], "LastName": "Torbin", "ForeName": "Aleksei P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000253774611"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lebedev Physical Institute, Samara 443011, Russia."}], "LastName": "Mikheyev", "ForeName": "Paul A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000272337206"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lebedev Physical Institute, Samara 443011, Russia."}], "LastName": "Kaiser", "ForeName": "Ralf I", "Initials": "RI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000272333133"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Samara National Research University, Samara 443086, Russia."}], "LastName": "Mebel", "ForeName": "Alexander M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000193414656"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lebedev Physical Institute, Samara 443011, Russia."}], "LastName": "Azyazov", "ForeName": "Valeriy N", "Initials": "VN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34717353", "10.1063/5.0064361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
