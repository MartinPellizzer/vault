It is an extremely reactive gas which rapidly forms intermediate oxidizing derivatives after inhalation. High concentrations cause death from pulmonary oedema. Both pulmonary and extrapulmonary toxicity have been observed at lower concentrations of ozone, including those currently present in urban air. Pulmonary cellular and subcellular membranes appear to be particularly susceptible. A primary mechanism of this effect is the oxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which has been demonstrated in rodent lungs after inhalation of ozone. Supporting evidence includes the potentiation of ozone toxicity by vitamin E deficiency and an increased use of this antioxidant vitamin during repetitive exposure to ozone. Other membrane effects include oxidation of thiol groups and, perhaps, of tryptophan. Microsomal alterations include a loss of lung cytochrome P450 which may also be related to lipid peroxidation. Extrapulmonary toxicity is not directly due to ozone but may represent in effect due to lipid peroxide decomposition products, particularly malonaldehyde. This three-carbon dialdehyde has been shown to alter cell membrane fluidity and to have mutagenic properties; the latter perhaps due to cross-linkage of DNA to histone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ciba Found Symp", "NlmUniqueID": "0356636", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["258163", "10.1002/9780470715413.ch17"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
