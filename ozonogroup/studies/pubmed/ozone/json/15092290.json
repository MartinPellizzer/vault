GA(3) was extracted with methanol from the lyophilized material. Subsequent purification steps included the use of polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP), cartridge reversed-phase purification, ethylacetate extraction and HPLC. The GA(3) was determined in the methylated form by means of a highly specific and sensitive enzyme immunoassay. Higher GA(3) contents were detected in young needles (year 1987) as compared to older ones (year 1986). However, no statistically significant differences were found in the GA(3) levels between the controls and the needles of trees which were treated with increased levels of ozone and acidic mist."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Botanik der TU Munich (Weihenstephan), D-8050 Freising 12, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schneider", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horn", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lauterbach", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hock", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092290", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90056-i", "0269-7491(90)90056-I"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
