Oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), particle nitrate (pNO<sub>3</sub>), peroxy nitrates (PNs), alkyl nitrates (ANs), and NO<sub>y</sub> measurements were made at both sites. Across all seasons at QC, the median NO<sub>x</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, pNO<sub>3</sub>, PNs, ANs, and NO<sub>y</sub> concentrations were 10.99, 0.49, 0.24, 0.62, 0.94, and 13.95 parts per billion (ppb), respectively. All-season median percent contributions of NO<sub>x</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, pNO<sub>3</sub>, PNs, and ANs to the total NO<sub>y</sub> at QC were 77, 4, 2, 5, and 7%, respectively. Therefore, the sum of the individual NO<sub>y</sub> species (NO<sub>yi</sub> \u2248 NO<sub>x</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub> +\u00a0pNO<sub>3</sub> +\u00a0PNs + ANs) accounted for 95% of the total NO<sub>y</sub> at QC, which was well within measurement uncertainties. At PSP, the median NO<sub>x</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, pNO<sub>3</sub>, PNs, ANs, and NO<sub>y</sub> concentrations were 0.65, 0.16, 0.12, 0.13, 0.18, and 1.56 ppb, respectively, over all seasons. The median percent contributions of NO<sub>x</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, pNO<sub>3</sub>, PNs, and ANs to NO<sub>y</sub> over all seasons at PSP were 42, 10, 8, 9, and 12%, respectively. NO<sub>yi</sub> comprised 81% of NO<sub>y</sub> across all seasons at PSP, and deviations from 100% closure were generally within measurement uncertainties. Since both datasets yielded NO<sub>y</sub> budget closure results that were either fully or largely explained by the measurement uncertainties, the observed NO<sub>yi</sub> is likely representative of ambient NO<sub>y</sub> in urban and rural New York. The results have implications for understanding the fate of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and their impact on local and regional air quality in urban and rural New York State.<i>Implications</i>: Continuous speciated and total reactive oxidized nitrogen (NO<sub>y</sub>) measurements were made in urban and rural New York from 2016 to 2018. Different NO<sub>y</sub> species have contrasting effects on the chemistry that impacts ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) formation and concentrations. Since O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are regulated pollutants that have proven difficult to control, the results have implications for current and future air quality policy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5001-6439"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York at Albany, Albany, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Ninneman", "ForeName": "Matthew", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York at Albany, Albany, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Marto", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "Stephanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Research & Analysis, Inc., Cary, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Edgerton", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Envair, Albany, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Blanchard", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York at Albany, Albany, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Schwab", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "7"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33395373", "10.1080/10962247.2020.1837289"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
