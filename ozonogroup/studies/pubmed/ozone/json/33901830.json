However, the impact of sewage treated water on the production mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, N<sub>2</sub>O production in the upper reach of a river was evaluated by field survey and activity test. The results demonstrated that the N<sub>2</sub>O production activity of the river pebbles increased with the inflow of the sewage treated water, which was supported by field survey results, such as the dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations and water quality. The emission factors of N<sub>2</sub>O were determined to be 0.02-0.05% in nitrification and 0.01-0.025% in denitrification. Our study shows that combining a field survey and an activity test improves the reliability of the results and leads to the appropriate quantitative evaluation. From a perspective of controlling the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from the sewage treatment plant, N<sub>2</sub>O generation inside the plant is critical. However, appropriate nitrogen removal in the treatment plant is connected to the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O generation in the river environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
