Conversion of As(III), which constituted over 70% of dissolved arsenic in the samples, to As(V) was fast with ozone, but sluggish with pure oxygen and air. Iron and manganese in the samples were also oxidized and, by sequestering the resultant As(V), played a significant role in the rate of reaction. Sorption capacity of freshly precipitated Fe(OH)3 was estimated to be 15.3 mg As/g. The kinetics of As(III) oxidation were interpreted using modified pseudo-first-order reaction. Half-lives of As(III) in experimental solutions involving saturation with each gas were approximately 4 min for the ozone reaction and, depending on the Fe concentrations, 2-5 days for pure oxygen and 4-9 days for air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Science, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nriagu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Teratogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N5509X556J", "NameOfSubstance": "arsenite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Teratogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10721144", "10.1016/s0048-9697(99)00470-2", "S0048-9697(99)00470-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
