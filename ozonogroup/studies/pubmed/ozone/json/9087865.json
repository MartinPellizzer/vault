We measured lung function and symptoms twice daily for one week each in fall, winter and spring; and concurrently assessed time-activity patterns and personal exposures. Average daily personal exposures correlated with pollutant concentrations at central sites (r = 0.61 for O3, 0.63 for NO2, 0.48 for PM). Questionnaire-reported outdoor activity increased slightly in communities/seasons with higher pollution. Lung function differences between communities were explainable by age differences. Morning forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased significantly with increase in PM or NO2 measured over the preceding 24 hours. Morning-to-afternoon change of forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) became significantly more negative with increase in PM, NO2, or O3 on the same day. Predicted FVC or FEV1 loss on highest- vs lowest-pollution days was < 2%. Daily symptoms showed no association with current or prior 24-hour pollution, but increased with decreasing temperature. Parents' questionnaire responses suggested excess asthma and allergy in children from one polluted community while children in the other polluted community reported more symptoms, relative to the cleaner community. We conclude that Los Angeles area children may experience slight lung function changes in association with day-to-day air quality changes, reasonably similar to responses seen by others in less polluted areas. Although short-term pollution effects appear small, they should be assessed in longitudinal lung function studies when possible, to allow maximally accurate measurement of longer-term function changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Service, Rancho Los Amigos, Medical Center, Downey, California 90242, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linn", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shamoo", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avol", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hackney", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9111438", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4245"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Likelihood Functions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9087865"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
