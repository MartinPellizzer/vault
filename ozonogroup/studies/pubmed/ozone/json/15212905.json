The aim of this study was to determine the daily, monthly and seasonal variation patterns of ozone concentrations at both sites and to study the possible regional influences. The daily variations mostly have the usual features with the afternoon maximum and the night minimum being more pronounced in the urban area. The average monthly concentrations throughout the year start to increase in March reaching their maximum values in July for the urban site. However, in the rural area, the monthly variations are smaller reaching their maximum value in June. The hourly evolution of the ozone concentrations in both sampling sites is well defined in spring and summer and not so well defined in autumn and winter. Taking into account the four seasons, the rural concentrations are higher than the urban ones. Summer is the season when there are similar concentrations at both sampling sites. Average hourly summer afternoon ozone for the hours 12:00-20:00 LST exceeded the 110 microg m(-3) European Union guidelines for human health for 8 h ozone exposure at the urban and rural sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics I, Faculty of Sciences, University of M\u00e1laga, M\u00e1laga 29071, Spain. mcduenas@uma.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Due\u00f1as", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ca\u00f1ete", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carretero", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liger", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15212905", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.04.013", "S0045-6535(04)00281-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
