Hence, the room temperature detection of N<sub>2</sub>O is highly desirable. In this work, The TCN(II)-KOH-rGO/CF modified electrode was successfully fabricated by drop coating method. The synthesized electrode was successfully characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR and XRD. The sensor electrode was used to detect different N<sub>2</sub>O concentration in flow conditions at room temperature. TCN(II)-KOH-rGO/CF modified electrode showed high sensitivity towards N<sub>2</sub>O, a wide range from 1ppm to 16\u00a0ppm and low detection of 1\u00a0ppm N<sub>2</sub>O were achieved for the TCN(II)-KOH-rGO/CF modified electrode. The limit of detection and the response towards this nitrogen oxide is competitive to other sensing methods. In addition, the sensitivity of the electrochemical sensor electrode was compared with the online Gas Chromatography. Additionally, the selectivity of the working electrode was analyzed and specified. The working electrode stability was analyzed for more than 30 days shows good stability. The fabricated TCN(II)-KOH-rGO/CF electrode is easier to prepare to get excellent analytical performance towards N<sub>2</sub>O. Hence, the proposed TCN(II)-KOH-rGO/CF electrode could be the suitable material for detection of N<sub>2</sub>O in the real site process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
