Leaf apoplastic extracts were analysed for peroxidase and oxidase activities in vitro, using different substrates. Partial loads in vivo were deduced using measured kinetic constants and substituted-enzyme catalysis approaches. Ascorbate use in O3 scavenging was calculated using measured stomatal conductances and ASC concentrations. Under elevated O3, stomatal conductance and O3 uptake were higher. O3 fluxes to the plasmalemma were levelled off by higher apoplastic ASC concentrations. The effect of CO2 enrichment on ASC concentrations under elevated O3 was minor. Under ambient O3, the ascending hierarchy of ASC users was: peroxidases, O3 scavenging, oxidases, coniferyl alcohol re-reduction. Under elevated O3, ASC use in O3 scavenging was higher than by oxidases. The redox state of ASC was not depressed by O3; there was no leaf injury. The cell wall/plasmalemma/cytosol system in birch had sufficient capacity to maintain ASC redox status in the apoplast, without necessity to restrict O3 uptake by stomatal closure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Padu", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kollist", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tulva", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moldau", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E7SM92591P", "NameOfSubstance": "coniferyl alcohol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15720628", "10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01220.x", "NPH1220"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
