"Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Through the environmental factors impact experiments,such as current intensity,initial pH value of the reaction solution,and the type and concentration of the electrolyte,effect and mechanism of electrochemically enhanced removal of nitrobenzene from aqueous solution on activated carbon fibers (ACF)-ozone technique were studied.The result showed that compared with the ACF-O<sub>3</sub> system,the removal efficiency of NB in electrochemically enhanced ACF-O<sub>3</sub> system was significantly improved.The effect of current intensity on the NB removal efficiency in the electrochemically enhanced ACF-O<sub>3</sub> system was not significant.O<sub>3</sub> concentration had some effect on the NB removal efficiency.The pH value of the initial reaction solution had a great influence on the catalytic activity of ACF in ACF-O<sub>3</sub> system.The presence of inorganic salts such as sodium sulfate,sodium nitrate and sodium chloride inhibited the catalytic ability of ACF in O<sub>3</sub> system.In addition,ACF was destroyed by ozone and the promoting effect of ACF was reduced.When the cathode electric field was applied on the surface of ACF,the removal effect of the organic compounds by ACF-O<sub>3</sub> was improved significantly and the structure of ACF was not destroyed by ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
