Epidemiological and experimental exposure studies indicate a harmful impact of outdoor air pollution from vehicles and factories both on the development of allergic diseases and asthma and the increase in asthma symptoms and exacerbations. The level of outdoor pollution in Asia is much higher and more diverse than those encountered in Western countries. This may increase the impact of outdoor pollution on health, particularly lung health in Asia. This review discusses the constituents of air pollution in Asia with a special focus on studies in mainland China and Taiwan where the levels of pollution have reached high levels and where such high levels particularly in winter can cause a thick haze that reduces visibility. The onus remains on regulatory and public health authorities to curb the sources of pollution so that the health effects on the population particularly those with lung and cardiovascular diseases and with increased susceptibility can be mitigated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China ; 2 National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London & Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust, London, UK ; 3 Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, 115 Zhunan, Taiwan ; 4 Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qingling", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China ; 2 National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London & Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust, London, UK ; 3 Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, 115 Zhunan, Taiwan ; 4 Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Zhiming", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China ; 2 National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London & Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust, London, UK ; 3 Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, 115 Zhunan, Taiwan ; 4 Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA."}], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Kian Fan", "Initials": "KF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China ; 2 National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London & Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust, London, UK ; 3 Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, 115 Zhunan, Taiwan ; 4 Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Shau-Ku", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Thorac Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101533916", "ISSNLinking": "2072-1439"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Thorac Dis. 2015 Oct;7(10):E520. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.10.10", "PMID": "26623135"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Chung KF, Zhang J, Zhong N.
