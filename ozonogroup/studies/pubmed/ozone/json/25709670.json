The present study compares the bleaching effect of ozone with office bleaching.", "In this experimental study, 15 maxillary premolar teeth were selected and sectioned mesio-distally and bucco-lingually. The sections were then placed in tea for 1 week according to the Sulieman method and were divided into three groups each comprised of 15 sections. The samples were bleached as followed; Group I: Bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide in three intervals of 8 min each, Group II: Underwent ozone treatment using Ozotop unite for 4 min and Group III: Bleached with a combination of both methods. The color indices of the samples, i.e., (a) green-red pigment, (b) blue-yellow pigment, (L) brightness, (\u0394E) overall color change, were evaluated pre- and post-bleaching utilizing a digital camera, Photoshop software and CIE lab index. The color changes of specimens then were calculated and analyzed through randomized analysis of variance and Tukey tests. P < 0.001 was considered to be significant.", "The color change (\u0394E) in Group II was significantly lower than those in the two other groups (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the color change of Groups I and III (P = 0.639). In addition, the results of L, a and b brought forth a similar pattern to the findings obtained from \u0394E.", "The hydrogen peroxide gel has a more powerful whitening effect than ozone; in addition, ozone has no synergistic effect when is used simultaneously with hydrogen peroxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zanjani", "ForeName": "Vagharedin Akhavan", "Initials": "VA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Dental Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Preventive Dentistry Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Torabzadeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Private Practice, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jamali", "ForeName": "Mahbobeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Iranian Center for Endodontic Research, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Razmavar", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, School of Paramedical Sciences, Dental Research Center, Research Institute of Dental Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baghban", "ForeName": "Alireza Akbarzadeh", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Dent Res J (Isfahan)", "NlmUniqueID": "101471186", "ISSNLinking": "1735-3327"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bartold PM.
