Since solar radiation in this spectral region dissociates molecular oxygen, the deep atmospheric penetration at this wavelength is of particular aeronomical interest. High resolution calculations of the transmittance down to 28.65 km were made for the 200-243-nm spectral range in this window region, in support of a stratospheric balloon flight from Fort Churchill in July 1974. The calculations were made by dividing the atmosphere into layers which were chosen so that each could be assumed homogeneous; optical depths were calculated separatelyfor each of these layers and then summed to obtain the over-all transmittance of the atmosphere. Absorptionby molecular oxygen (line and continuum) and by ozone was included, as well as extinction through Rayleigh scattering by air molecules. The calculated transmittances were combined with hig h altitude(above 100-km) rocket measurements of the sun-center spectrum and center-to-limb variations to give residual high resolution solar spectral flux for several altitudes and solar zenith angles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cann", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nicholls", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohl", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurucz", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parkinson", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reeves", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20208861", "10.1364/AO.18.000964", "22899"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
