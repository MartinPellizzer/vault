A number of 177 samples were obtained from 16 aquaculture facilities for a monitoring period of two years. OTC was detected in 93 samples with a median concentration of 116\u202fng/L. OXO, FLO, and AMX were also detected in 36, 34, and 22 samples with median concentrations of 90, 44, and 63\u202fng/L, respectively. After antibiotics were applied to fish tanks, the aquaculture effluents were found to contain antibiotics up to several hundred \u03bcg/L, indicating that some control measures are required. Bench-scale experiments showed that chlorine and ozone fully eliminated AMX and OTC but not FLO at \u22642\u202fmg/L of oxidant dosage. Reactive halogen species formed in the marine water matrix enhanced the antibiotic degradation. UV<sub>254</sub> most effectively eliminated FLO, achieving 60-70 % elimination at 1000\u202fmJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of UV fluence. Sequential use of chlorine followed by UV<sub>254</sub> demonstrated significant elimination of all four selected antibiotics. The obtained kinetic information for the reactions of these oxidants and UV with the antibiotics and marine aquaculture water constituents could be useful for designing and optimizing the aquaculture water treatment processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
