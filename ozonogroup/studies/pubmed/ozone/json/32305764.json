Concerning collection efficiency, some correlation was detected to both the AD technology and the amount of energy and fertilizer recovered. Nine out of 31\u00a0CE plants were based on solid anaerobic digestion batch located in those areas with collection efficiency <65%, recovering about 100\u00a0kg and 125\u00a0kWh of fertilizer and electricity, respectively, per Mg of bio-waste. The 17 plants adopting wet technologies were implemented in areas with collection efficiency ranging from 50% up to >85% able to recover on average about 130\u00a0kg of fertilizer and 275\u00a0kWh of electricity per each Mg of bio-waste. Wet AD was also the only adopted for larger size plants from 60,000\u00a0Mg/year up to 600,000\u00a0Mg/year. Legal constraint on the direct use on land of the digestate caused an average increase of main impacts such as global warming (kgCO<sub>2eq</sub>), freshwater eutrophication (kgP<sub>eq</sub>) and human health (DALY) of about 300%. The effect of the quality of the bio-waste returned after the collection showed lower incidence on the overall impacts of about 20%, and mainly limited to global warming (kgCO<sub>2eq</sub>) and photochemical ozone formation (kgNMVOC<sub>eq</sub>)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
