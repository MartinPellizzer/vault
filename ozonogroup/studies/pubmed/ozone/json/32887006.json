If landfill leachate is to be treated using a combined \"biological + advanced treatment\" process, the molecular information of OM must be investigated to optimize the operation parameters of the combined process and maximize the removal of organic pollutants. This study applied ultra-high resolution mass spectroscopy to investigate the degradation and transformation characteristics of refractory OM in mature landfill leachate at the molecular level (m/z\u00a0=\u00a0150-800) during biological treatment (i.e., semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter, SAARB) and subsequent chemical oxidation (i.e., the Fenton process and ozonation). After SAARB treatment, the polycyclic aromatics (aromatic index, AI\u00a0>\u00a00.66) and polyphenol (0.66\u00a0\u2265\u00a0AI\u00a0>\u00a00.50) contents increased, and the highly unsaturated phenolic compounds (AI\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.50 and H/C\u00a0<\u00a01.5), which have a high bioavailability, were mostly removed. Compared with raw leachate, SAARB effluent (i.e., SAARB leachate) contained fewer organics with short carbon chains, more organics with long carbon chains, an elevated condensation degree for organics and, thus, a considerably reduced biodegradability. Although both the Fenton and ozonation processes could remove many of the polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols, ozone produced considerable amounts of aliphatic compounds with high bioavailability. Compared to ozonation, the Fenton process utilized the hydroxyl radical to non-selectively react with OM and produced better mineralization results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
