It is now proved that it can affect different body organs which necessitate intensive care management. Ozone (O3)\u00a0therapy was used before for treating various viral infections like hepatitis B, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola viruses.\u00a0O3\u00a0also can manage hypoxia and increase tissue oxygenation, besides its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may have an important role in the management of cytokine storm. We used rectal O3\u00a0insufflation therapy assuming that it may have a beneficial role in the management of COVID-19 disease. Two sessions of rectal O3\u00a0therapy were given to a 60-year-old female patient\u00a0who was confirmed COVID-19 positive. Before applying\u00a0O3 therapy, she was hypoxic (sPO2:90%) despite mechanical ventilation with high fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2:90%). After therapy, she was markedly improved and discharged to the inpatient ward and then discharged home on day 10 post-admission. Another 40-year-old male patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive and was home isolated received one session of O3 therapy. Before therapy, he was hypoxic (sPO2:85% on room air and 95% with O2 face mask 5 L/min). The patient showed gradual improvement over the next 3 days after therapy and becomes oxygen-independent (sPO2 became 94-97% on room air). No adverse effects were noticed in both cases. Rectal O3 insufflation can be used safely as adjuvant management for patients with COVID-19 disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.33003.33", "0000 0000 9889 5690"], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, P.O.
