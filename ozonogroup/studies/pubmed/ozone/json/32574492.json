With this aim, Milstein and co-workers developed a PNP pincer ruthenium catalyst for the homogeneous hydrogenation of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), an ozone-depleting substance and the third most important greenhouse gas, to generate dinitrogen and water as resultant products. The mechanism of this promising transformation was unveiled by means of experiments together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which inspired Milstein and co-workers to use similar (PNN)Ru-H pincer catalysts for the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O by CO to produce N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. The use of the latter type of catalysts resulted in the proposition of a new reaction protocol and allowed to work under milder conditions. Here we describe the detailed mechanism of the last transformation catalyzed by a (PNN)Ru-H catalyst by means of DFT calculations, and not only this, but we also discover the way to block undesired parasitic reactions. Apart from that, we have explored a new evolution of this family of catalysts to go beyond previous experimental outcomes. The mechanism consists of a cascade of easy steps, starting from an insertion of the N<sub>2</sub>O oxygen into the Ru-H bond generating a hydroxo intermediate and releasing N<sub>2</sub> and ending with a \u03b2-hydride elimination to form CO<sub>2</sub> and regenerate the catalyst. The whole process occurs in a facile way with the exception of two steps: the formation of the hydroxyl ligand and the final \u03b2-hydride elimination to form CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the energy barriers of these two steps are not the bottleneck in the catalysis but rather the ease of the pyridyl group bonded to Ru to isomerize by C-H activation. We propose to solve this drawback by tuning the PNN ligand to block the pyridyl free rotation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1159-7397"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Qu\u00edmica Computacional i Cat\u00e0lisi and Departament de Qu\u00edmica, Universitat de Girona, C/Ma Aur\u00e8lia Capmany 69, 17003 Girona, Catalonia, Spain."}], "LastName": "Escayola", "ForeName": "S\u00edlvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1917-7450"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Qu\u00edmica Computacional i Cat\u00e0lisi and Departament de Qu\u00edmica, Universitat de Girona, C/Ma Aur\u00e8lia Capmany 69, 17003 Girona, Catalonia, Spain."}], "LastName": "Sol\u00e0", "ForeName": "Miquel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8997-2599"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Qu\u00edmica Computacional i Cat\u00e0lisi and Departament de Qu\u00edmica, Universitat de Girona, C/Ma Aur\u00e8lia Capmany 69, 17003 Girona, Catalonia, Spain."}], "LastName": "Poater", "ForeName": "Albert", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32574492", "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c01252"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
