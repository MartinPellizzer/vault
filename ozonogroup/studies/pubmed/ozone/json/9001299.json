Ninety healthy volunteers (56 never-smokers, age [mean +/- SD] 25 +/- 4 yr; 34 current smokers, 13 +/- 9 pack-yr, age 28 +/- 1 yr) were exposed to 0.22 ppm ozone for 4 h, with exercise, in an environmental chamber. We measured spirometry and specific airway conductance before, during, and immediately after exposure, and assessed symptoms by questionnaire. Smokers experienced a smaller increase in respiratory symptoms following exposure to ozone than did nonsmokers. Decrements in FEV1 were significantly less than for smokers than for nonsmokers (p = 0.0013). Ozone responsiveness (> 15% fall in FEV1) occurred in 16 of 56 never-smokers (28.6%) and 4 of 34 smokers (11.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis found pack-yr of smoking to be associated with decreased ozone responsiveness (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, p = 0.017). Age, gender, and methacholine responsiveness were not predictive of responder status. Fourteen smokers and 25 nonsmokers were subsequently exposed once to air and twice to ozone; smokers as well as nonsmokers were consistent in their subsequent responsiveness (or lack of responsiveness) to ozone. Healthy smokers have smaller decrements in lung function and fewer symptoms in response to ozone exposure than do nonsmokers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642-8692, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frampton", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morrow", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torres", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Voter", "ForeName": "K Z", "Initials": "KZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utell", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01ES02679", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01HL51701", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR00044", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maximal Midexpiratory Flow Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9001299", "10.1164/ajrccm.155.1.9001299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
