In vitro treatment with cytochalasin D (cyto D, 2-10 x 10(-6) M) increased the rate of movement of [14C]mannitol across the epithelium. Exposure to vinblastine (VB, 10(-4) M) alone had no significant effect. However, VB in combination with cyto D increased the permeability in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo exposure to ozone (O3, 0.8 or 2.0 ppm, 2 h) had only a slight effect on the rate of movement of the tracer as measured in vitro immediately after exposure. At 24 h postexposure there was no significant difference in permeability between ozone- and air-exposed tracheas. Prior in vivo O3 exposure sensitized the tracheas to the in vitro effects of cyto D; treatment of O3-exposed tracheas with cyto D immediately after O3 exposure produced a greater than additive effect on permeability measured in vitro. VB at concentrations up to 10(-4) M had no enhancing effect on permeability in O3-exposed tracheas. Sham exposure to clean air did not affect permeability compared to untreated (shelf) controls. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated penetration of horseradish peroxidase into intercellular spaces in the tracheas treated in vitro with cyto D or cyto D plus VB. Cyto D is known to affect intracellular microfilaments that have attachments at or near the cell surface, while VB affects microtubules associated with internal cellular structures. Therefore, the synergistic effect on tracheal permeability observed with O3 and cyto D, but not with O3 and VB, suggests that O3 may change cell surface structures associated with the microfilamentous cytoskeleton."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community and Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92717."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03695", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochalasins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5V9KLZ54CY", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinblastine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Horseradish Peroxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochalasins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Horseradish Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vinblastine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2707184", "10.3109/01902148909087857"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
