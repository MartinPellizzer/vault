Materials used for carriers (test surfaces) included polished stainless steel and used airplane materials including seatbelt latches, window dust covers, sidewall laminates, and tray tables.", "While demonstrating reasonable efficacy under some experimental conditions, the data indicated that 222 nm Far UV-C disinfection alone does not reliably provide a 3 log10 or 99.9% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces from an airplane cabin. An Ushio (Cypress, CA) 1.7\" x 2.3\" Care222\u00ae 12W 222nm BI lamp module tested in triplicate at a low (\u2053 1.5 mJ cm-2), medium (\u2053 3.0 mJ cm-2), and high (\u2053 6 to 9 mJ cm-2) fluence did not provide a \u2265 3 log10 or 99.9% reduction of SARS-CoV-2. The reduction of SARS-CoV-2 was greatest on stainless steel. The result was a log10 reduction of 2.83, 1.33, 2.58, and 2.21 logs for virus samples containing saline, saline with 2.5 mg BSA, saline with 0.25 mg BSA, and artificial saliva respectively at a dosage of 5 to 9 mJ cm-2. The log10 reduction of SARS-CoV-2 in saline with 2.5 mg bovine serum albumin was lowest with 1.33 for stainless steel, 0.93 for belt latch, and 0.61 for tray table at a dosage of 5 to 6 mJ cm-2.The second UV lighting system tested was a prototype mobile wand with a built-in short-pass filtered krypton-chloride cylindrical lamp. One pass of the wand over a tray holding carriers inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva at a rate of approximately 1 foot (1') per second (sec) exposed the carriers to 7.3 mJ cm-2. The log10 reductions determined for the single pass were 2.97, 3.75, 1.78, 1.91, and 1.28 logs for stainless steel, belt latch, dust cover, sidewall, and tray table respectively. Two passes of the wand generated 17.2 mJ cm-2 and resulted in log10 reductions of 4.04, 3.74, 4.24, 3.68, and 1.66 logs for stainless steel, belt latch, dust cover, sidewall, and tray table respectively. The combination of higher fluence from multiple passes of the wand, the close proximity (10 cm wand to the carrier), the exposure to elevated temperatures up to 35\u00b0C, and ozone from the bulb being blown directly onto the carriers contributed to effective viral inactivation on all surfaces except the airplane tray table. The impact of temperature and ozone on viral inactivation should be determined for future testing of the 222 nm UV-C wand."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
