Atomic force microscopy coupled with an electrochemical (e-AFM) technique revealed that proton conduction decreased with film thickness; an abrupt decrease in proton conductance was observed when the film thickness was less than ca. 10 nm on GC substrates in addition to a significant change in surface morphology. Furthermore, thin films prepared on H-GC substrates with UV-ozone treatment exhibited higher proton conduction than those on untreated GC substrates. However, Pt substrates exhibited proton conduction comparable to that of GCs for films thicker than 20 nm; a decrease in proton conduction was observed at \u223c5 nm thick film but was still much higher than for carbon substrates. These results indicate that the number of active proton-conductive pathways and/or the connectivity of the proton path network changed with film thickness. The surface morphology of thinner films was significantly affected by the film/substrate interface and was fundamentally different from that of the bulk thick membrane."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-8-31, Midorigaoka, Ikeda, Osaka 563-8577, Japan. a-oohira@aist.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohira", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuroda", "ForeName": "Seiichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Hamdy F M", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tavernier", "ForeName": "Bruno", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Electrolytes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbon Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "39464-59-0", "NameOfSubstance": "perfluorosulfonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbon Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23748745", "10.1039/c3cp51136g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
