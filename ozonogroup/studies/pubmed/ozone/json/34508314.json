However, little evidence exists regarding the synergy between gaseous pollutants and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to estimate the effect of individual gaseous pollutants on hospital admissions for CVD and to explore the possible synergistic effects between gaseous pollutants. Daily hospitalization counts for CVD were collected from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. We also collected daily time series on gaseous pollutants from the Environment of the People's Republic of China, including NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>. We used distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) to assess the association of individual gaseous pollutants on CVD hospitalization, after controlling for seasonality, day of the week, public holidays, and weather variables. Then, we explored the variability across age and sex groups. In addition, we analyzed the synergistic effects between gaseous pollutants on CVD. Extremely low NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> increase the risk of CVD in all subgroup at lag 7 days. The greatest effect of high concentration of SO<sub>2</sub> was observed in male and the elderly (\u2265 65 years) at lag 3 days. Greater effects of high concentration of O<sub>3</sub> were more pronounced in the young (< 65 years) and female at lag 3 days, while the effect of low concentration of O<sub>3</sub> was greater in male and the young (< 65 years) at lag 0 day. We found a synergistic effect between NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> for CVD, as well as between SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. The synergistic effects of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> on CVD were stronger in the elderly (\u2265 65) and female. The female was sensitive to synergistic effects of SO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>. Interestingly, we found that there was a risk of CVD in the susceptible population even for gaseous pollutant concentrations below the National Environmental Quality Standard. The synergy between NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> was significantly associated with cardiovascular disease hospitalization in the elderly (\u2265 65). This study provides evidence for the synergistic effect of gaseous pollutants on hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
