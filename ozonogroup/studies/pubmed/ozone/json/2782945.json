However, there are only limited observations concerning re-exposure to O3 at intervals between 24 h and several days. The present study was designed to assess the effects of re-exposure to 0.35 ppm O3 at intervals of 24, 48, 72, and 120 h. Forty young adult male subjects were assigned randomly to one of four groups in ascending order of time to re-exposure (groups 1-4). Each exercised on a bicycle ergometer for 60 min at a workload that elicited a mean ventilation of 60 l/min on three occasions: protocol 1 (P1), filtered air (FA); protocol 2 (P2), 0.35 ppm O3; and protocol 3 (P3), 0.35 ppm O3. In addition to standard pulmonary function measures, specific airway resistance (SRaw); exercise ventilatory pattern, i.e., respiratory frequency (fR) and tidal volume (VT); and subjective symptoms (SS) were assessed. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p less than .05) for all groups between the FA (P1) responses and those for the two O3 exposures (P2, P3) for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), SRaw, fR, VT, and SS. When the two O3 exposures (P2 and P3) were compared, only group 1 (24 h) responses were statistically significant upon re-exposure: FEV1.0, -16.1 vs. -30.4% (p less than .003); SRaw, 20.5 vs. 34.5% (p less than .05); fR, 44.2 vs. 65.3% (p less than .001); and SS (p less than .015).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Education, University of California, Davis."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schonfeld", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Flow Rates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography, Whole Body"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2782945", "10.1080/00039896.1989.9935888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
