Previous research shows that bromate can be microbially reduced to bromide using organic (i.e. acetate, glucose, ethanol) and inorganic (H(2)) electron-donating substrates. In this study, the reduction of bromate by a mixed microbial culture was investigated using elemental sulfur (S(0)) as an electron donor. In batch bioassays performed at 30 degrees C, bromate (0.30 mM) was completely converted to bromide after 10 days and no accumulation of intermediates occurred. Bromate was also reduced in cultures supplemented with thiosulfate and hydrogen sulfide as electron donor. Our results demonstrated that S(0)-disproportionating microorganisms were responsible for the reduction of bromate in cultures spiked with S(0) through an indirect mechanism involving microbial formation of sulfide and subsequent abiotic reduction of bromate by the biogenic sulfide. Confirmation of this mechanism is the fact that bromate was shown to undergo rapid chemical reduction by sulfide (but not S(0) or thiosulfate) in abiotic experiments. Bromate concentrations above 0.30 mM inhibited sulfide formation by S(0)-disproportionating bacteria, leading to a decrease in the rate of bromate reduction. The results suggest that biological formation of sulfide from by S(0) disproportionation could support the chemical removal of bromate without having to directly use sulfide as a reagent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, 85721-0011, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chairez", "ForeName": "Monserrat", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luna-Velasco", "ForeName": "Antonia", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Field", "ForeName": "Jim A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Xiumin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sierra-Alvarez", "ForeName": "Reyes", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biodegradation", "NlmUniqueID": "9100834", "ISSNLinking": "0923-9820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19763846", "10.1007/s10532-009-9296-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
