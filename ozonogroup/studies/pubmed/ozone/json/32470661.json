The kinetic and synergistic study confirmed the pseudo-first-order reaction and highest performance of the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process for the SNAs degradation process. Two modeling approach, central composite design (CCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were utilized to investigate the optimization and modeling of SSZ degradation as the response of O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system and results were compared. The individual and interactive effects of main operational parameters were also possessed by the main effect graphs, contour and response surface plots. The experimental results showed maximum degradation efficiency at the optimum condition for SSZ, SMX, SMT and MNZ were 98.10%, 89.34%, 86.29% and 58.70%, respectively in O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. For proposed reaction mechanism of SNAs in O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process the influence of inorganic salts including Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaCl and tert butanol (TBA) as organic OH scavenger was studied. Besides that, LC-MS/MS analysis and DFT calculation were employed to identify the intermediate molecules produced (31 species) during the SSZ degradation (as a SNAs model) and a probable degradation pathway was proposed. The results provided a new strategy by combination of experiment and computer simulation to evaluate the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system for optimization of SNAs removal from wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
