One approach for evaluating the accuracy of a VOC emission inventory is the development of a chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model for ambient non-methane organic compound (NMOC) measurements. CMB evaluations of ambient hydrocarbon data provide a sample-specific allocation of emissions to individual source categories. This study summarizes the results of an application of the CMB model to the NMOC data from the SEMOS study. Comparison of CMB results with emission inventory values for the Detroit area show that vehicle emissions are well represented by the inventory, as are architectural coatings and coke ovens. Estimated emissions from petroleum refineries and graphic arts industries are much lower in the inventory than determined from the receptor allocation. Under-reporting of fugitive VOC emissions from petroleum refineries is an ongoing problem. Emissions from graphic arts industries are underestimated in the inventory partly because of the broad characterization of the emission factor (i.e., mass emitted/capita), which may be less useful when specific locations and days are under consideration. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of the CMB approach when used prospectively to track the implementation of emission control strategies. While vehicle emission concentrations were unchanged from 1988 to 1993, measurement-based CMB results suggest a decrease in evaporative emissions during this time period resulting from Reid vapor pressure (RVP) reductions (from 11.0 psi in 1988 to 8.6 psi in 1993) and fleet turnover. Changes in emissions from coke plants and petroleum refineries were also seen in the CMB allocations for these sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a University of Illinois at Chicago, School of Public Health , Chicago , Illinois."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scheff", "ForeName": "Peter A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wadden", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kenski", "ForeName": "Donna M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental and Energy Staff, General Motors Corporation , Detroit , Michigan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolff", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28071516", "10.1080/10473289.1996.10467540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
