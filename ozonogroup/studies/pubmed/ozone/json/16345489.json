The phage were rapidly inactivated during the first 5 s of the reaction by 5 and 7 logs at ozone concentrations of 0.09 and 0.8 mg/liter, respectively. During the next 10 min, the phage were further inactivated at a slower rate in both treatments. The [H]uridine-labeled f2 phage and its ribonucleic acid (RNA) were examined to elucidate the mechanism of ozone inactivation, utilizing adsorption to host bacteria, sucrose density gradient analysis, and electron microscopy. The specific adsorption of the phage was reduced by ozonation in the same pattern as plaque-forming unit reduction. RNA was released from the phage particles during ozonation, although it had reduced infectivity for spheroplasts. Electron microscopic examination showed that the phage coat was broken by ozonation into many protein subunit pieces and that the specific adsorption of the phage to host pili was inversely related to the extent of phage breakage. The RNA enclosed in the phage coat was inactivated less by ozonation than were whole phage, but inactivated more than naked RNA. These findings suggest that ozone breaks the protein capsid into subunits, liberating RNA and disrupting adsorption to the host pili, and that the RNA may be secondarily sheared by a reduction with and/or without the coat protein molecules, which have been modified by ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gentile", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sproul", "ForeName": "O J", "Initials": "OJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Water Pollut Control Fed. 1973 Dec;45(12):2493-507", "ArticleIdList": ["4769855"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Microbiol. 1972 Oct;24(4):658-9", "ArticleIdList": ["4343866"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1954 Jul;51(1):208-16", "ArticleIdList": ["13181475"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1977 Jan;33(1):168-77", "ArticleIdList": ["189686"]}, {"Citation": "Virology. 1973 Aug;54(2):476-94", "ArticleIdList": ["4125252"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1969 Sep;8(9):3587-92", "ArticleIdList": ["4185970"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1965 Nov;82(3):317-28", "ArticleIdList": ["4285343"]}, {"Citation": "J Water Pollut Control Fed. 1973 Dec;45(12):2433-43", "ArticleIdList": ["4358738"]}, {"Citation": "Virology. 1970 Mar;40(3):734-44", "ArticleIdList": ["4908735"]}, {"Citation": "Atmos Environ. 1969 Nov;3(6):669-82", "ArticleIdList": ["5382204"]}, {"Citation": "J Water Pollut Control Fed. 1976 Jan;48(1):61-76", "ArticleIdList": ["176476"]}, {"Citation": "J Hyg (Lond). 1977 Apr;78(2):199-211", "ArticleIdList": ["265342"]}, {"Citation": "J Mol Biol. 1966 Dec 28;22(2):235-47", "ArticleIdList": ["4166029"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1961 Mar 15;47:282-9", "ArticleIdList": ["13763053"]}, {"Citation": "J Mol Biol. 1967 Mar 14;24(2):261-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6030026"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Inst Pasteur (Paris). 1968 May;114(5):595-607", "ArticleIdList": ["4938484"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16345489", "PMC291306", "10.1128/aem.39.1.210-218.1980"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
