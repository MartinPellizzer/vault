Among them, Co-Cr catalyst stood out in catalytic ozonation of aromatic VOCs, and its activity on acetone conversion was promoted by raising the temperature and ozone concentrations, owing to lower crystallization, larger surface area, excellent redox and VOCs/CO<sub>2</sub> desorption ability. Above 95% conversion of all multi-VOCs was achieved over the Co-Cr catalyst when the temperature was 100\u00a0\u00b0C and an excess ozone ratio \u03bb (the ratio of actual moles of ozone to theoretical moles of ozone needed) was equal to 3. A competitive relationship was noticed during the removal process of four multiple VOCs, with significant inhibition of acetone conversion in the presence of aromatic VOCs, conceivably due to adsorption competition and byproducts accumulation. Effects of NO/SO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O and respective reversibility were also investigated. The inhibition effects of NO/SO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O on aromatic VOCs were far less than those on acetone. Further, the retarding effect of NO was reversible, attributing to physical adsorption competition, but the inhibition effect of SO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O was irreversible, due to the blockage of active sites for VOCs removal. With the combination of scrubbing, multi-VOCs and NO/SO<sub>2</sub> could be removed by catalytic ozonation simultaneously and efficiently. In-situ DRIFTS measurement was also conducted to investigate the adsorption and catalytic ozonation process of multi-VOCs mixtures, as well as under the presence of SO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O, discovering the major intermediates, surface carboxylates and carboxylic acids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
