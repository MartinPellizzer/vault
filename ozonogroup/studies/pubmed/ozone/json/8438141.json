With regard to atmospheric pollution, high exposures to ozone during summer are of major concern. A substantial reduction of ozone levels appears to be considerable problem in view of the high population and particular topography. More precise estimates of possible health damage require further epidemiological studies. In this context it is interesting to note that the environmental catastrophe of Kuwait did not reveal new insights into the dose-effect relation of air pollutants, in that the exposure of the population and hence the health hazards of oil fires were less serious than expected. As to the wellbeing of humans, indoor air pollution deserves equal attention. The predominant noxious agent is tobacco smoke, which significantly affects the respiratory health of infants. In addition, there is some epidemiological evidence that passive smoking can cause lung cancer. However, a variety of other and often neglected pollutants can be present in homes and at workplaces and may be the cause of various respiratory diseases. Finally, thought is given to more general problems such as better definitions and diagnosis of diseases due to airborne agents, the cost-benefit ratio and the conflicts of interest involved in effective control measures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pneumologische Abteilung, Medizinische Universit\u00e4tsklinik Bern."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bachofen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Luftverschmutzung."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Schweiz Med Wochenschr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404401", "ISSNLinking": "0036-7672"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}], "NumberOfReferences": "35"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8438141"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
