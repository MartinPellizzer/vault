At x=0.3 and 0.5, most of the manganese was incorporated in the fluorite structure of CeO(2) to form a solid solution. The catalytic activity was best at x=0.5, at which the temperature of 100% removal rate is the lowest (270\u00b0C). The temperature for 100% removal of HCHO oxidation is reduced by approximately 40\u00b0C by loading 5wt.% CuO(x) into Mn(0.5)Ce(0.5)O(2). With ozone catalytic oxidation, HCHO (61 ppm) in gas stream was completely oxidized by adding 506 ppm O\u2083over Mn(0.5)Ce(0.5)O(2) catalyst with a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 10,000 hr\u207b\u00b9 at 25\u00b0C. The effect of the molar ratio of O(3) to HCHO was also investigated. As O(3)/HCHO ratio was increased from 3 to 8, the removal efficiency of HCHO was increased from 83.3% to 100%. With O(3)/HCHO ratio of 8, the mineralization efficiency of HCHO to CO(2) was 86.1%. At 25\u00b0C, the p-type oxide semiconductor (Mn(0.5)Ce(0.5)O(2)) exhibited an excellent ozone decomposition efficiency of 99.2%, which significantly exceeded that of n-type oxide semiconductors such as TiO(2), which had a low ozone decomposition efficiency (9.81%). At a GHSV of 10,000 hr\u207b\u00b9, [O(3)]/[HCHO]=3 and temperature of 25\u00b0C, a high HCHO removal efficiency (\u2265 81.2%) was maintained throughout the durability test of 80 hr, indicating the long-term stability of the catalyst for HCHO removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014.
