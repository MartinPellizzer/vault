Results suggested that a free chlorine concentration of approximately 0.8 mg/l was necessary to maintain the pools in a bacteriologically satisfactory condition. This amount of free chlorine was similar to that required when the pool was disinfected with chlorine alone. However, the associated amount of combined chlorine was much lower when disinfection was by ozone/chlorine and this gave more acceptable bathing conditions. Implications for the manamgement of pools disinfected by this method are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wyatt", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Hyg (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "0375374", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1724"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Northern Ireland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming Pools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1970 Apr;60(4):740-50", "ArticleIdList": ["4985286"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36429", "PMC2130084", "10.1017/s002217240005395x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
