BAO is 30 km north of Denver and is in the southwestern section of Wattenberg Field, one of Colorado's most productive O&NG fields. We compare VOC concentrations at BAO to those of other U.S. cities and summertime measurements at two additional sites in northeastern Colorado, as well as the composition of raw natural gas from Wattenberg Field. These comparisons show that (i) the VOC source signature associated with O&NG operations can be clearly differentiated from urban sources dominated by vehicular exhaust, and (ii) VOCs emitted from O&NG operations are evident at all three measurement sites in northeastern Colorado. At BAO, the reactivity of VOCs with the hydroxyl radical (OH) was dominated by C(2)-C(6) alkanes due to their remarkably large abundances (e.g., mean propane = 27.2 ppbv). Through statistical regression analysis, we estimate that on average 55 \u00b1 18% of the VOC-OH reactivity was attributable to emissions from O&NG operations indicating that these emissions are a significant source of ozone precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States. jessica.gilman@noaa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilman", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lerner", "ForeName": "B M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuster", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Gouw", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Natural Gas"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4FEX897A91", "NameOfSubstance": "pentane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T75W9911L6", "NameOfSubstance": "Propane"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2013 Sep 3;47(17):10094"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorado"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Natural Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Propane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23316938", "10.1021/es304119a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
