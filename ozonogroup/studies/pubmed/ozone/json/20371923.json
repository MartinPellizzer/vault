Although removal potential of many EDCs by conventional WWTPs is recognised, literature data are not easily comparable. Besides, in order to reach very low concentrations, a further treatment might be sometimes required. Positive results can be achieved by tertiary chemical oxidation; nevertheless, technical-economic suitability is still to be fully demonstrated. In this work, two estrogen-like susbstances were considered: nonylphenol (NP) (and its parent compounds) and bisphenol A (BPA). The experimental work was conducted at Verona (Northern Italy) WWTP (370,000 p.e.): after a 15 days sampling campaign, which was carried out in order to calculate mass balance of target compounds, chemical oxidation tests were performed on effluent by means of UV/H(2)O(2) process and ozonation. Technical-economic feasibility of these solutions is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Architettura, Territorio e Ambiente (DICATA), Universit\u00e0 di Brescia, via Branze 43, 25123 Brescia, Italy. giorgio.bertanza@ing.unibs.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bertanza", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedrazzani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zambarda", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grande", "ForeName": "M Dal", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Icarelli", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldassarre", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20371923", "10.2166/wst.2010.132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
