The air-insulated switchgear during PD enables the decomposition of air components, namely, O<sub>3</sub> and NO. A set of experimental platforms was designed on the basis of the principle of ultraviolet differential optical absorption spectroscopy (UV-DOAS) to detect O<sub>3</sub> and NO concentrations in air-insulated switchgear. Differential absorption algorithm and wavelet transform were used to extract effective absorption spectra; a linear relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and NO concentrations and absorption spectrum data were established. O<sub>3</sub> detection linearity was up to 0.9992 and the detection limit was at 3.76\u2009ppm. NO detection linearity was up to 0.9990 and the detection limit was at 0.64\u2009ppm. Results indicate that detection platform is suitable for detecting trace O<sub>3</sub> and NO gases produced by PD of the air-insulated switchgear."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yalong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoxing", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Hunan Electric Power Maintenance Company, Changsha, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zhaolun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Optical Material Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET), Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Spectrosc", "NlmUniqueID": "0372406", "ISSNLinking": "0003-7028"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29726705", "10.1177/0003702818773091"]}}]}
