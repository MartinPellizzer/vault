The greater the water content of the soil the less effective the ozone treatment, with air-dried soils showing the greatest removal of phenanthrene; while soils with higher levels of clay also reduced the effectiveness of the ozone treatments. However, at least a 50% reduction in phenanthrene levels was achieved in air-dried soil after an ozone treatment of 6 h at 20 ppm, with up to 85% removal of phenanthrene achieved in sandy soils. The biodegradation results indicate that P. alcaligenes PA-10 may be useful as an inoculant for the removal of PAHs from contaminated soils. Under the conditions used in our experiments, however, pre-ozonation did not enhance subsequent biodegradation of phenanthrene in the soils. Similar levels of phenanthrene removal occurred in both non-ozonated and ozonated Cruden Bay soil inoculated with P. alcaligenes PA-10. However, the biodegradation of phenanthrene in ozonated Boyndie soil was much slower. This may be due to the release of toxic products in this soil during ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Environmental Research Institute, University College Cork, National University of Ireland, Cork, Ireland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Mahony", "ForeName": "Mark M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobson", "ForeName": "Alan D W", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Jeremy D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singleton", "ForeName": "Ian", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "448J8E5BST", "NameOfSubstance": "phenanthrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas alcaligenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16153687", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.07.018", "S0045-6535(05)00924-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
