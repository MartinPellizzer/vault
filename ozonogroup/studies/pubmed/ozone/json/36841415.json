Tunnel tests are an effective way to measure real-world vehicle emissions, and the data collected are also suitable for receptor modeling to analyze the contributions of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) from different types of vehicles, as the closed environment ensures good mixing and minimal aging. In this study, tunnel tests were conducted inside a heavily trafficked city tunnel in Guangzhou in south China, and the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied to the inlet-outlet incremental NMHC data. The results revealed that gasoline vehicles (GVs), Liquefied Petroleum Gas vehicles (LPGVs), and diesel vehicles (DVs) were responsible for 39\u00a0%, 45\u00a0% and 16\u00a0% of NMHCs, and 52\u00a0%, 23\u00a0%, and 24\u00a0% of the ozone formation potentials, respectively. LPGVs were the largest contributor of (56\u00a0%) alkanes, and GVs were the largest contributor of aromatics (61\u00a0%) and C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkenes (55\u00a0%). With the video-recorded traffic counts the emissions of different fuel types are further compared on a per-vehicle-per-kilometer basis, and the results reveal that LPGVs and GVs were comparable in the OFPs of NMHCs emitted per kilometer, while on average a DV emitted 2.0 times more NMHCs than a GV with 2.4 times more OFPs. This study highlights substantial contribution of reactive alkenes and aromatics by DVs and the benefits of strengthening diesel exhaust control in terms of preventing ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
