Results indicated that iron silicate is a microporous material with poor crystallinity. Fe-O-Si and Fe-O bonds were observed on its surface. The Fe-O bonds belonged to \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation test was performed in batch reaction mode, and 4-chloronitrobenzene was used as model organic compounds. Amorphous iron silicate exhibited high catalytic activity, ozone utilization efficiency, and stability in catalytic ozonation. Hydroxyl radical was the dominant oxide species in this process. The reaction mechanism at the solid-water interface indicates that Fe-Si binary oxides on iron silicate surface inhibited ozone futile decomposition. This behavior resulted in enhanced probability of the reaction between ozone and \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the iron silicate surface to generate hydroxyl radicals, which promoted 4-chloronitrobenzene removal in aqueous solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3267-0653"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Provincial Joint Engineering Laboratory of Wetland Ecological Conservation, Heilongjiang Academy of Science , Harbin, 150040, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin, 150090, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jimin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin, 150090, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Pengwei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology , Harbin, 150090, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhonglin", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CVL66U249D", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chloronitrobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29314834", "10.1021/acs.est.7b04875"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
