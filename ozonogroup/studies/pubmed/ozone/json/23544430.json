A well-defined reduction peak was observed at ~380 mV for H-terminated BDD, whereas it was observed at ~200 mV in the case of O-terminated BDD for an ozone solution in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution at pH 7. The peak potential for ozone reduction was selective with respect to oxygen reduction at both H- and O-terminated BDD electrodes, whereas it occurred at approximately the same potential as oxygen reduction at other types of solid electrodes, including glassy-carbon, platinum, and gold electrodes. Interference from chlorine was not observed in lower concentration than 300 \u03bcM ClO(-). Furthermore, in order to apply the detection technique to electrolyte-free media, BDD microelectrodes were also used. A linear calibration curve for dissolved ozone in water could be achieved between concentrations of 0.49 and 740 \u03bcM, with an estimated detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.185 \u03bcM (S/N = 3). Excellent stability was demonstrated for repetitions of these calibration curves performed in 3 consecutive days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Keio University, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "Yuya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ivandini", "ForeName": "Tribidasari A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "Kazutaka", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Einaga", "ForeName": "Yasuaki", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9E3X5056Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Boron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23544430", "10.1021/ac400043b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
