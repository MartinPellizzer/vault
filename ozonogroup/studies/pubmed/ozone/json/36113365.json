Until now, there is no effective approach to reverse airflow limitation and accelerated loss of lung function completely. Here, we delineate the efficacy of mouse allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mASCs) in the treatment of COPD mice by intratracheal and intravenous administration.", "In this study, we established ozone-exposed COPD model in mice and were administered intratracheally or intravenously with mASCs which were extracted, cultured, and identified in vitro.", "We observed that exposure to ozone resulted in a marked lung neutrophilia with high levels of inflammatory cell counts, enhanced expression of cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, reduced expression of IL-10, lung function and airspace enlargement. mASCs intratracheal administration rescured the lung neutrophilia, lung function and emphysema-like phenotype. Similar results were observed in mice with mASCs intravenous administration. But the altered levels of serum cytokines in mice with mASCs intratracheal administration appears more robust than those in mice with mASCs intravenous administration.", "Collectively, these data indicate that intratracheal administration of mASCs appears more effective in treating ozone-induced COPD compared to intravenous administration of mASCs, although the two approaches can be comparable in safety. mASCs are expected to become a new potential intervention strategy for COPD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
