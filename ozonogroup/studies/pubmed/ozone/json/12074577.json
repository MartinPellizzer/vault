Nipponbare), we identified a single copy gene called OsMSRMK2 from jasmonic acid (JA) treated rice seedling leaf cDNA library. This gene has a conserved protein kinase domain, including a MAPK family signature, and encodes a 369 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 42995.43 and a pI of 5.48. OsMSRMK2 did not show constitutive expression in leaves and was induced within 15 min in response to wounding by cut. Using in vitro system, we show that the expression of OsMSRMK2 mRNA was potently enhanced within 15 min by signalling molecules, protein phosphatase inhibitors, ultraviolet irradiation, fungal elicitor, heavy metals, high salt and sucrose, and drought. OsMSRMK2 expression was further modulated by co-application of JA, salicylic acid, and ethylene and required de novo synthesized protein factor(s) in its transient regulation. Moreover, high (37 degrees C) and low temperatures (12 degrees C) and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide-differentially regulate the OsMSRMK2 mRNA accumulation in leaves of intact plants. Present results demonstrating dramatic transcriptional and transient regulation of the OsMSRMK2 expression by diverse biotic/abiotic stresses, a first report for any rice (or plant) MAPK to date, suggest a role for OsMSRMK2 in rice defense/stress response pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory for Agricultural Biotechnology and Biochemistry (RLABB), GPO Box 8207, Kathmandu, Nepal. gkagrawal@onebox.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Ganesh K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakwal", "ForeName": "Randeep", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwahashi", "ForeName": "Hitoshi", "Initials": "H"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AJ486975"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "0372516", "ISSNLinking": "0006-291X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6RI5N05OWW", "NameOfSubstance": "jasmonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12074577", "10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00571-5", "S0006-291X(02)00571-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
