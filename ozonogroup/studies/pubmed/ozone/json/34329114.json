However, their poor moisture resistance often leads to undesirable catalytic effects in the presence of high humidity. In this study, a novel catalyst with \u03b3-like MnO<sub>2</sub> was synthesized using the selective dissolution method on LaMnO<sub>3</sub> perovskites. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited quite stable ozone conversion of ~90% within 12\u00a0h under 75% relative humidity (400-800\u00a0ppm of ozone, 30\u00a0\u00b0C, 150 000\u00a0mL\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup> of WHSV). In contrast, traditional \u03b3-MnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst showed deficient resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O and sensitivity to space velocity. Detailed characterizations showed that the larger number of oxygen vacancies induced by structure reconstruction of the \u03b3-like MnO<sub>2</sub> and residual La<sup>3+</sup> cations facilitated ozone decomposition in humid atmosphere. Finally, the reaction rate of ozone decomposition was proposed by a kinetic study, which further proved that the amount and hydrophilicity of oxygen vacancies are the determinants of the first-order reaction rate constant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
