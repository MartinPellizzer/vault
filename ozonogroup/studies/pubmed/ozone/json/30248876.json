However, our mechanistic understanding of O<sub>3</sub> dry deposition is insufficient to adequately account for it in global and regional models, primarily because this process is highly complicated by feedback mechanisms and sensitivity to specific characteristics of vegetative environment and atmospheric dynamics and composition. We hypothesized that measuring dry deposition of O<sub>3</sub> to vegetation near the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) coast, where large variations in meteorological conditions and photochemical air pollution frequently occur, would enable identifying the mechanisms controlling O<sub>3</sub> deposition to vegetation. Moreover, we have only limited knowledge of O<sub>3</sub> deposition to vegetation occurring near a coastline, under air pollution, or in the EM. This study investigated O<sub>3</sub> deposition to mixed Mediterranean vegetation between the summers of 2015 and 2017, 3.6\u202fkm away from the EM coast, using the eddy covariance technique to quantify vertical flux of O<sub>3</sub> and its partitioning to stomatal and non-stomatal flux, concurrent with nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>), sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Surprisingly, nighttime O<sub>3</sub>-deposition velocity (V<sub>d</sub>) was smaller than daytime V<sub>d</sub> by only ~20-37% on average for all measurement periods, primarily related to moderate nighttime atmospheric stability due to proximity to the seashore. We provide evidence for the role of sea-salt aerosols in enhancing O<sub>3</sub> deposition via surface-wetness buildup at low relative humidity near the coast, and for daytime enhancement of O<sub>3</sub> deposition by the combined effects of biogenic volatile organic compound emission and surface-wetness buildup. We further show that NO<sub>x</sub> emitted from elevated emission sources can reduce O<sub>3</sub> deposition, and even lead to a positive O<sub>3</sub> flux, demonstrating the importance of adequately taking into account the impact of air pollution on O<sub>3</sub> deposition to vegetation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
