In such processes, particle-phase organic iodine compounds (OICs) are key reservoir species in their loss processes. However, their presence and formation mechanism remain unclear, especially in continental regions. Using gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with both electron capture negative ionization and electron impact sources, this study systematically identified unknown OICs in 2-year samples of ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) collected in Beijing, an inland city. We determined the molecular structure of 37 unknown OICs, among which six species were confirmed by reference standards. The higher concentrations for \u2211<sub>37</sub>OICs (median: 280 pg m<sup>-3</sup>; range: 49.0-770 pg m<sup>-3</sup>) measured in the heating season indicate intensive coal combustion sources of atmospheric iodine. 1-Iodo-2-naphthol and 4-iodoresorcinol are the most abundant species mainly from primary combustion emission and secondary formation, respectively. The detection of 2- and 4-iodoresorcinols, but not of iodine-substituted catechol/hydroquinone or 5-iodoresorcinol, suggests that they are formed via the electrophilic substitution of resorcinol by hypoiodous acid, a product of the reaction of iodine with ozone. This study reports isomeric information on OICs in continental urban PM<sub>2.5</sub> and provides valuable evidence on the formation mechanism of OICs in ambient particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory for Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, P.
