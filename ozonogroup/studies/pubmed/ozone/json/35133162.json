Water in the atmosphere acts as both a reaction medium and a reductant during the ozonolysis. Inspired by the atmospheric aqueous-phase ozonolysis, we herein report the ozonolysis of alkenes in water assisted by surfactants. Several types of surfactants, including anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants, were investigated. Although most surfactants enhanced the solubility of alkenes in water, they also generated excessive foaming during the ozone bubbling, which led to the loss of products. Mitigation of the frothing was accomplished by using Coolade as a nonionic and low-foaming surfactant. Coolade-assisted ozonolysis of alkenes in water provided the desired carbonyl products in good yields and comparable to those achieved in organic solvents. During the ozonolysis reaction, water molecules trapped within the polyethylene glycol region of Coolade were proposed to intercept the Criegee intermediate to provide a hydroxy hydroperoxide intermediate. Decomposition of the hydroxy hydroperoxide led to formation of the carbonyl product without the need for a reductant typically required for the conventional ozonolysis using organic solvents. This study presents Coolade as an effective surfactant to improve the solubility of alkenes while mitigating frothing during the ozonolysis in water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Chemistry for Fine Chemical Production and Environmental Remediation Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Buntasana", "ForeName": "Supanat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Chemistry for Fine Chemical Production and Environmental Remediation Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Chemistry for Fine Chemical Production and Environmental Remediation Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Saetung", "ForeName": "Prakorn", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Maejo University, Sansai, Chiang Mai 50290, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Klumphu", "ForeName": "Piyatida", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9184-9506"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Organic Synthesis Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Vilaivan", "ForeName": "Tirayut", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2551-5110"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Green Chemistry for Fine Chemical Production and Environmental Remediation Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Phayathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Padungros", "ForeName": "Panuwat", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reducing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reducing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35133162", "10.1021/acs.joc.1c02539"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
