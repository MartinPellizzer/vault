Clinical-laboratory and instrumental parameters were evaluated before and after treatment. In addition, the blood flow of the prostate, prostatic urethra and skin at the projection point of the prostate was studied.", "Standard treatment of CNPIC with the concurrent use of general and local ozone therapy resulted in a reduction of pain intensity and severity of dysuria, improvement of the sexual function and quality of life of men. There was an increase in blood flow in the arteries and veins of the prostate, a decrease in the prostate size and volume. The study findings showed an almost twofold decrease of the mean values of the CNPIC clinical index during treatment. In the prostate secretion, the leukocyte count decreased from 29.29+/-0.67 to 4.75+/-0.15. A statistically significant (p<0.001) decrease in all sizes of the prostate was observed: height (upper) from 40.99+/-0.22 to 39.13+/-0.21 mm, width (transverse dimension) from 41.94+/-0.21 to 39.94+/-0.22 mm, and thickness (anteroposterior size) from 30.52+/-0.20 to 29.15+/-0.18 mm. Prostate volume also decreased from 27.78+/-0.42 to 24.10+/-0.36 cm (p<0.001)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Voino-Yasenetsky Krasnoyarsk State Medical University of Minzdrav of Russia, Krasnoyarsk, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "I.M.
