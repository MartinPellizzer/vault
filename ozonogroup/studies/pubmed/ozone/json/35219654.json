However, as precursors of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, the emissions of reactive nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) were reported to have large uncertainties. Here, combined with the simulated formaldehyde (HCHO) columns from the RAMS-CMAQ modeling system, formaldehyde (HCHO) columns derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were used as the constraints to improve the emission estimates of the reactive NMVOCs through the linear regression method over the PRD region in March of 2017. The observed highest HCHO concentration was 2-4 times as high as the original simulated results over the PRD region mostly due to the underestimation in the reactive NMVOC emissions, especially the anthropogenic sources. With the regression coefficients calculated through five sensitivity simulation cases as well as the observed HCHO column, the better quantified emissions of reactive NMVOCs were obtained over the PRD region. It showed that the total emissions of reactive NMVOCs were improved by a factor of 2.1. The emissions derived from anthropogenic, biomass burning and biogenic sources increased from 0.0329, 4.69 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.0524 Tg/month to 0.0959, 0.0215 and 0.0620 Tg/month, respectively. As a result, the difference between the observed and modeled high HCHO column decreased to 1-2.5 times, which may be dominated by the enhanced reactive NMVOC emissions derived from anthropogenic sources. Besides, the great improvement in the emissions of reactive NMVOCs contributed to an increase of 20-40 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentration over the PRD region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
