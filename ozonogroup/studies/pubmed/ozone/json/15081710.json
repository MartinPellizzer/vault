The high air pollutant levels impose harm to the human health and impair the city image. The characteristic analysis of air pollutants is very important and necessary to pollutant monitoring, forecasting and controlling. In this study, the interaction patterns of principle air pollutants, e.g. nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxides (NO(x)) and ozone (O(3)), a secondary pollutant, are investigated based on the measured database in four selected areas, which covers two urban types (i.e. residential area, mixed residential/commercial/industrial area) in Hong Kong, during the period of 1999-2001. The study involves analyzing the chemical and physical properties, the characteristics of air pollutants and the factors affecting such interactions using statistical method. The results reveal several routines in urban air pollutants' variations, interaction and trends from macro aspect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Construction, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, PR China. bcwzlu@cityu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "W Z", "Initials": "WZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X K", "Initials": "XK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15081710", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2003.10.028", "S0048-9697(03)00634-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
