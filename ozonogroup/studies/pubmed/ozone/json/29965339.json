And the concentrations of particle matter, nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>), sulfur dioxides (SO<sub>2</sub>) and mercury and its compounds were also measured. Results demonstrated that the concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub> and mercury and its compounds emitted from all five boilers were relatively low, which were lower than the national emission standard, while NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and particles from some boilers were higher than the standard. The mass concentration of 56 VOC species was in the range of (872.43\u00b1293.80)-(6929.66\u00b11137.25) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the analysis of influencing factors implied that the furnace temperatures and loads havd strong negative correlations with the concentration of total VOCs. The emission components of VOCs were mainly composed of alkenes (41%-59%) including ethylene, 1-butene, cis-2-butene and 1-hexene; alkanes (27%-49%) including hexane, isopentane and cyclopentane; and aromatics (6%-18%) including benzene and toluene. Moreover, the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) method was applied to analyze ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs. The contribution of OFP of five boilers was mainly from alkenes, occupying a relatively high percentage of 76%-90%, and that of alkanes was in the range of 6% to 19%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chang-da", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Li-Ran", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bo-Guang", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li-Hui", "Initials": "LH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965339", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201611209"]}}]}
