Iodide (I<sup>-</sup>) is easily oxidized to HOI by various oxidation processes and its reaction with dissolved organic matter (DOM) can produce I-DBPs. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) plays a key role in minimizing the formation of I-DBPs by reduction of HOI during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-based advanced oxidation processes or water treatment based on peracetic acid or ferrate(VI). To assess the importance of these reactions, second order rate constants for the reaction of HOI with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were determined in the pH range of 4.0-12.0. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed considerable reactivity with HOI near neutral pH (k<sub>app</sub>\u00a0=\u00a09.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup> and 6.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0at pH 7.1 and 8.0, respectively). The species-specific second order rate constants for the reactions of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with HOI, HO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> with HOI, and HO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> with OI<sup>-</sup> were determined as k<sub>H2O2+HOI</sub>\u00a0=\u00a029\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, k<sub>HO2</sub><sup>-</sup><sub>+HOI</sub>\u00a0= (3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, and k<sub>HO2</sub><sup>-</sup><sub>+OI</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00a0= (6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The activation energy for the reaction between HOI and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was determined to be E<sub>a</sub>\u00a0=\u00a034\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup>. The effect of buffer types (phosphate, acetate, and borate) and their concentrations was also investigated. Phosphate and acetate buffers significantly increased the rate of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-HOI reaction at pH 7.3 and 4.7, respectively, whereas the effect of borate was moderate. It could be demonstrated, that the formation of iodophenols from phenol as a model for I-DBPs formation was significantly reduced by the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to HOI- and phenol-containing solutions. During water treatment with the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process or peracetic acid in the presence of I<sup>-</sup>, O<sub>3</sub> and peracetic acid will be consumed by a catalytic oxidation of I<sup>-</sup> due to the fast reduction of HOI by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The O<sub>3</sub> deposition on the ocean surface may also be influenced by the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which leads to a catalytic consumption of O<sub>3</sub> by I<sup>-</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
