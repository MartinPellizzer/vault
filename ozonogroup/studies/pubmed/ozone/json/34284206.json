The total NNI concentrations in raw water and treated water samples from the drinking water treatment plants were 20.4-166\u00a0ng/L (median 118\u00a0ng/L) and 1.11-94.7\u00a0ng/L (median 20.4\u00a0ng/L), respectively. The dinotefuran (DIN) concentrations in raw water collected in different seasons were different, and the highest DIN concentration was found in summer. The drinking water treatment processes removed >91% of the NNIs except DIN and thiamethoxam (THIAM), for which the mean removal rates were 70% and 74%, respectively. The removal rates for all of the NNIs were higher for the granular activated carbon filtration process (mean 83.5%) than the other drinking water treatment plant processes (coagulation/sedimentation 22.3%, ozonation 29.2%). However, the removal rates in the granular activated carbon process were lower for DIN and THIAM (61.0% and 59.2%, respectively) than the other NNIs. Significant correlations were found between the NNI removal rates and physicochemical properties (solubility in water and log (octanol-water partition coefficient)). The estimated mean human exposure to NNIs in drinking water was 0.528 ng/(kg body weight d)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
