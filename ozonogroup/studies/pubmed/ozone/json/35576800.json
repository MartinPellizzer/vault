Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) may mediate cardiovascular effects of exposure to air pollution. This study aims to investigate whether circulating miRNAs mediate the associations between short-term human exposure to ambient air pollution and cardiovascular biomarkers.", "Twenty-four healthy adults residing in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, USA were enrolled between December 2016 and July 2019. Circulating miRNAs, protein, and lipid biomarkers were assessed repeatedly for 3 sessions separated by at least 7 days. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations between air pollutant concentrations obtained from nearby air quality monitoring stations and miRNAs controlling for covariates including omega-3 index, relative humidity, and temperature. miRNAs that were significantly altered were then matched with protein or blood lipid biomarkers using either Ingenuity Pathway Analysis or a literature search. A mediation analysis was performed to test the statistical significance of miRNA's mediating effects between exposure to air pollution and cardiovascular biomarkers.", "Short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) was associated with changes in 11, 9, and 24 circulating miRNAs, respectively. Pathway analysis showed that several miRNAs including miR-125b-5p, miR-144-5p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-34a-5p may mediate the effects of air pollutant exposure on the changes of downstream protein / lipid biomarkers including serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble vascular adhesive molecules 1 (sICAM1), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Mediation analysis showed that only miR-26a-5p significantly mediated air pollutant (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>)-induced effects on blood CRP and total cholesterol levels. For example, 34.1% of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated changes in CRP were significantly mediated by miR-26a-5p at lag4 [indirect effects, 0.06 (0.02, 0.10), P\u00a0=\u00a00.005]. Similarly, the proportions of indirect effects of miR-26a-5p on the association between NO<sub>2</sub> exposure and CRP were 46.8% at lag2 [0.06 (0.02, 0.11), P\u00a0=\u00a00.003], 61.2% at lag3 [0.05 (0.00, 0.09), P\u00a0=\u00a00.04], and 30.8% at 5-day moving average [0.06 (0.02, 0.10), P\u00a0=\u00a00.01]. In addition, omega-3 index may be a significant modifying factor of the mediated effects of miRNAs.", "This study demonstrates that short-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with specific circulating miRNAs, and some of which may mediate their effects on the downstream inflammation and blood lipid markers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, TN, USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Siqi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yunan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Rappold", "ForeName": "Ana G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Diaz-Sanchez", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Samet", "ForeName": "James M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.
