Aldehyde species, in particular, are important exposure hazards in indoor residential and occupational environments, and precursors to particulate matter and ozone formation in outdoor air. Formation pathways of aldehydes from oils that lead to their emissions are not well understood. In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in the formation of aldehydes from heated cooking oil emissions, through studying how antioxidants and oil composition modulate oxidation chemistry. Our results demonstrate that gaseous emissions are driven by radical-mediated autoxidation reactions in cooking oil, and the composition of cooking oils strongly influences the reaction mechanisms. Antioxidants have a dual effect on aldehyde emissions depending on the rates of radical propagation reactions. We propose a mechanistic framework that can be used to understand and predict cooking emissions under different cooking conditions. Our results highlight the need to understand the rates and mechanisms of autoxidation and other reactions in cooking oils in order to accurately predict the gas- and particle-phase emissions from food cooking in urban atmospheres."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0980-6911"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 3E5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Takhar", "ForeName": "Manpreet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Ya'an, 625014, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yunchun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6531-4412"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 3E5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Ditto", "ForeName": "Jenna C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7392-4237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 3E5, Canada."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Arthur W H", "Initials": "AWH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35194622", "10.1039/d1em00532d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
