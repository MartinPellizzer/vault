The results showed that the advanced treatment was more efficient than the conventional treatment at removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 40-67% removal), UV<sub>254</sub> (61-81% removal), the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP; 37-70% removal) and the haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP; 35-89% removal). The sand filter in the conventional treatment process was identified as the main contributor to decreasing DOC, UV<sub>254</sub> and DBPFP. The O<sub>3</sub>-BAC in advanced treatment was found to decrease THMFP and HAAFP, with removal rates of 17-40% and 22-59%, respectively. To improve the water quality of effluents, advanced treatment with O<sub>3</sub>-BAC should be used to treat raw water from the shallow water supply reservoir in lower Yangtze River. However, the increased DBPFP yield, which is proportional to the potential health risks, should not be ignored."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hygiene, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hygiene, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Hongliang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Hygiene, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Nanxiang", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32192412", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1745290"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
