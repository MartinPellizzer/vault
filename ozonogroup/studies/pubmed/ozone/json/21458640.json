In this method, silica gel impregnated with a mixture of trans-1,2-bis(2-pyridyl)ethylene (2BPE) and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) is used as the absorbent; further, a porous sintered polyethylene tube (PSP-diffusion filter), which acts as a diffusive membrane, and a small polypropylene syringe (PP-reservoir) for elution of the analytes from the absorbent are used. The carbonyls present in air react with DNPH in the absorbent to form hydrazone derivatives. Concurrently, ozone in the air reacts with 2BPE to form pyridine-2-aldehyde, which immediately reacts with DNPH to form a pyridine-2-aldehyde hydrazone derivative. All the hydrazones derived from airborne carbonyls, including pyridine-2-aldehyde (formed from ozone), are completely separated and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The sampling rates of ozone (44.6 mL min(-1)) and formaldehyde (72.0 mL min(-1)) are determined by comparison with the rates obtained in an active sampling method. The sampling rates of other carbonyl compounds are calculated from the respective molecular weights according to a rule based on Graham's law. The calculated sampling rates agree with the experimental values. The DSD-BPE/DNPH method is advantageous because it is simple and allows for the simultaneous analysis of ozone and carbonyls."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
