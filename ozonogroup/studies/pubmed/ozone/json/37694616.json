The results showed that a significant decreasing trend of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations by 50.0% was observed from 2013 to 2020, whereas an increasing trend for O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 25.8% was observed from 2013 to 2020. Compared with that in 2013 to 2017, the monthly difference in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations gradually narrowed from 2018 to 2020, whereas the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> had increased significantly since April, and the occurrence time of O<sub>3</sub> pollution was advanced. The correlation coefficient patterns of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed obvious seasonal distribution characteristics. The correlation coefficients were negatively correlated in winter and positively correlated in the summer, and the correlation coefficients in summer were generally higher than those in other seasons. The correlation coefficients between O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in different seasons were positively proportional to the fitting slope. The ratios of the fitting slope to correlation coefficients showed an increasing trend, which might reflect that the inhibitory effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on O<sub>3</sub> formation in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> interaction mechanism might have been weakened due to the impact of emission reduction. A significant decreasing trend was observed for the long-term trend components of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration time series; emission reduction played a leading role, and meteorological factors contributed -3 to 6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The changes in the relationship between the PM<sub>2.5</sub>/CO ratio versus NO<sub>2</sub>/SO<sub>2</sub> from negative to positive were observed from 2013-2017 to 2018-2020 in Tianjin, which could indicate the enhanced contribution potential of nitrogen oxides to the main secondary component formation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> under the current emission reduction scenarios, and the main secondary components of PM<sub>2.5</sub>in Tianjin gradually changed from sulfate to nitrate. An overall upward trend was observed for the long-term trend components of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration time series from 2013 to 2020, and the contribution of precursor emissions to the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub> increased from 2013 to 2018 and began to decrease after 2019. The contribution of meteorological factors to the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub> presented an obvious stage change, showing a downward trend from 2013 to 2016 and an upward trend from 2016 to 2020. The O<sub>3</sub> concentration presented a non-linear relationship with NO<sub>2</sub> during the period of intense atmospheric photochemical processes (11:00-16:00) in summer. Compared with that in 2013-2015, the fitting curve of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> showed an obvious offset to the low value of NO<sub>2</sub> from 2016 to 2020, which reflected that the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission reduction in this period achieved certain results. Compared with that in 2018, the fitting curve of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> moved downward from 2019 to 2020, which may reflect that NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs emission reduction had a non-negligible effect on the O<sub>3</sub> decline at this stage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Mei", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ambient Air Particulate Matter Pollution Prevention and Control, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ya-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jing-Yun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorological Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Nai-Yuan", "Initials": "NY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Ambient Air Particulate Matter Pollution Prevention and Control, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Fen", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Yun-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37694616", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202210215"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
