Compared with a single O<sub>3</sub> system, the synergy between carbon sphere (CS) and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) improved the electron transfer efficiency and the formation rate of \u2022OH. The coexistence of Co and Ni in various valence states might accelerate the cyclic process of Co(II)/Co(III) and Ni(II)/Ni(III), thereby improving the catalytic activity. Taking levofloxacin as a model pollutant, the mechanism of catalytic process was discussed, and the catalytic reaction was successfully applied to the removal of residual organics in bio-treated coking wastewater (BTCW). The removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) in 60\u00a0min were 50.85%-53.71% and 39.98%-43.48%. From the perspective of UV absorption and 3D EEM, catalytic ozonation was more conducive to breaking the electronic protection of inert organic molecules such as heterocyclic compounds, and achieving higher efficiency of mineralization. It provides a new idea for catalytic ozonation technology of wastewater treatment in the future from theory, technology and application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
