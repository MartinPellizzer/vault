We used rat models of CVD with or without obesity and compared them to healthy strains to examine the risk factors of ozone-induced lung injury and inflammation. We examined functional, biochemical and molecular changes in several organs to evaluate how physiological factors as well as compensatory antioxidant reserves modulate processes by which ozone injury is influenced by underlying disease. In this study, we highlight key findings of this series of reports. We show that underlying cardiopulmonary insufficiency in genetically predisposed rats appears to increase the effective ozone dose; thus dosimetry is one factor contributing to exacerbated ozone effects. We further show that antioxidant reserve in airway lining fluid modulates ozone-induced damage such that strains with the least antioxidant reserve incur the greatest injury. And finally, we show that the inflammatory response to ozone is governed by a cluster of genes involved in regulating cytokine release, trafficking of inflammatory cells and processes related to cellular apoptosis and growth. All such processes are influenced not only by ozone dosimetry and the lung antioxidant milieu but also by the strain-specific genetic factors. In using a comprehensive systems biology research approach, our data reveal key risk factors for--and strategies to reduce risk of--air pollution mortality among those with CVD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Dye", "ForeName": "Janice A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b National Program for Air Climate & Energy Research, Office of Research and Development, US Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "Daniel L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA and."}], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "Urmila P", "Initials": "UP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26667335", "10.3109/08958378.2014.995388"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
