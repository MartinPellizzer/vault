Thus, photo-Fenton-assisted ozonation has been studied and compared with ozonation at alkaline pH and conventional single ultraviolet (UV) and acid ozonation treatments. In the combined process, the overall kinetic rate constant was split into various components: direct oxidation by UV light, direct oxidation by ozone and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. Molecular and/or radical ozone reaction was studied by conducting the reaction in the presence and absence of tert-butylalcohol at pHs 2, 7 and 9. Ozone oxidation rate increases with pH or by the addition of Fenton reagent and/or UV radiation due to generation of hydroxyl radicals, *OH. Hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion play a double role during oxidation since at low concentrations they act as initiators of hydroxyl radicals but at high concentrations they act as radical scavengers. Finally, the additional levels of degradation by formation of hydroxyl radicals have been quantified in comparison to the conventional single processes and an equation is proposed for the reaction rate as a function of studied operating variables."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica, Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenieros Industriales, Avda.
