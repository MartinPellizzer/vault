Herein, we show a reaction route for the formation of Cl<sub>2</sub>O, which is a source of stratospheric chlorine, in the ClONO<sub>2</sub> + HOCl reaction at the air-water interface. Our <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations show that the (ClONO<sub>2</sub>)Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(HOCl) halogen bond plays a key role in the reaction and is the main interaction between ClONO<sub>2</sub> and HOCl both at the air-water interface and in the bulk liquid water. Furthermore, metadynamics-based AIMD simulations reveal two pathways: (i) The OCl fragment of HOCl binds to the Cl atom in ClONO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in the formation of Cl<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Simultaneously, the remaining hydrogen atom is transferred to a water molecule to form H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. (ii) HOCl acts as a bridge for Cl atom transfer from ClONO<sub>2</sub> to the O atom of a water molecule, and this water molecule transfers one of its H atoms to another water molecule, forming two HOCl molecules, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. Free-energy calculations show that the former is the energetically more favorable process. More importantly, the free-energy barrier for Cl<sub>2</sub>O formation at the air-water interface is only \u223c0.8 kcal/mol, and the reaction is exothermic. These findings provide insights into the importance of fundamental chlorine chemistry and the broader implications of the aerosol air-water interface for atmospheric chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Zhengyi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Theoretical & Computational Photochemistry of Ministry of Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100190, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chongqin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5461-1486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth & Environmental Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37522957", "10.1021/jacs.3c06527"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
