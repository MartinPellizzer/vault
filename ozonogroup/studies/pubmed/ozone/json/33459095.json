The sub-group analysis for caries increment (SMD -0.14, 95% CI: [-0.21 to -0.07], <i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.0001) and the post intervention <i>S mutans</i> count (SMD -0.42, 95% CI: [-0.62 to -0.23], <i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.0001) significantly favours 'xylitol-TF' and 'CPP-ACP-TF' combined therapy respectively. The high/unclear risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness of the included trials presented a low certainty of evidence.", "CPP-ACP-TF exhibits superiority over TF monotherapy in remineralizing existing lesions and demonstrates better antibacterial effect, whereas it is not more effective for preventing caries incidence. However, Xylitol exerts an added benefit over fluoride alone in preventing caries increment.
