The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of increasing or decreasing joint instability on cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone changes in knee OA by comparing different models of joint instability.", "We used the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACL-T) model and the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model. In addition, we created a controlled abnormal tibial translation (CATT) model and a controlled abnormal tibial rotation (CATR) model. We performed joint instability analysis, micro-computed tomography analysis, histological and immunohistological analysis in 4 and 6 weeks.", "The CATT group suppressed joint instability in the ACL-T group (6 weeks; P\u00a0=\u00a00.032), and the CATR group suppressed joint instability in the DMM group (6 weeks; P\u00a0=\u00a00.032). Chondrocyte hypertrophy in the ACL-T and DMM groups was increased compared to the Sham group (6 weeks; [ACL-T vs Sham], P\u00a0=\u00a00.002, 95%CI [5.983-33.025]; [DMM vs Sham], P\u00a0=\u00a00.022, 95%CI [1.691-28.733]). In the subchondral bone, the BV/TV in the DMM and CATR groups was increased compared to the ACL-T and CATT groups (6 weeks; [DMM vs ACL-T], P\u00a0=\u00a00.002, 95%CI [7.404-37.582]; [DMM vs CATT], P\u00a0=\u00a00.014, 95%CI [2.881-33.059]; [CATR vs ACL-T], P\u00a0=\u00a00.006, 95%CI [4.615-34.793]; [CATR vs CATT], P\u00a0=\u00a00.048, 95%CI [0.092-30.270]).", "This study showed that joint instability promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy, but subchondral bone changes were influenced by differences in ACL and meniscus function."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
