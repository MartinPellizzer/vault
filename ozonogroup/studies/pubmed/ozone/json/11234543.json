TREGRO was parameterized using information from a field experiment conducted at Ithaca, NY, USA; the model was then applied using environmental information from Suwon, Korea, where O3 exposures of aspen had not been conducted. In the parameterization at Ithaca, the simulated and measured total biomass differed by about 3% and the differences between measured and simulated biomass gain of leaf, shoot, and root were 15.4, 8.3, and 4.4%, respectively. Simulating growth at Suwon required adjustment in growth rates to match measured growth due to the different weather conditions at the two cities. The assimilated carbon was evenly distributed to each tissue (foliage, branch, stem, coarse, fine roots) in Suwon, whereas it was mainly allocated to vigorous stem growth in Ithaca. The vigorous growth under Suwon conditions resulted in less total non-structural carbon and perhaps trees more vulnerable to O3 stress. Although the ambient O3 in Suwon (1.2 ppm.h of sum of the hourly concentrations greater than 0.06 ppm [SUM06]) was lower than that in Ithaca (2.1 ppm.h of SUM06), a reduction of 8% of total assimilated carbon was found compared to simulation without O3. Severe effects on root growth at elevated O3 (1.7 times ambient) were predicted; however, the effects on leaf growth would not be as severe."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biology and Chemistry, Seoul National University, Suwon 441-744, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "E W", "Initials": "EW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laurence", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11234543", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00108-1", "S0269-7491(00)00108-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
