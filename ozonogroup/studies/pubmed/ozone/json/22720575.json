The organic products were characterized by GC/MS and LC/MS and NO3- produced during degradation was determined by IC, on the basis of which the degradation path of Prometon was also investigated. The result indicated that when concentration of Prometon was 2 mg x L(-1), dosage of ozone was 13 mg x L(-1), the reactive temperature was 25 degrees C, the optimal condition of degradation was as follows, n(H2O2)/n (O3 ) = 0.7, pH 7-8; The micro inorganic and organic substances in tap water promoted the removal rate of the Prometon comparing to that in pure water, and HCO3- showed inhibition effect on degradation. The results of GC/MS and LC/MS suggested that the triazine ring of Prometon was not destroyed during the AOP, the two isopropyl of triazine ring were disengaged firstly, and the NO3- detected by IC might be the oxidation product of the amido of the triazine ring."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building & Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen Polytechnic Institute, Shenzhen 518055, China. lshaofeng@szpt.edu.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-Feng", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chu", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1610-18-0", "NameOfSubstance": "prometone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Triazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22720575"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
