Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> are two important climatic factors that have been widely studied before. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> alters the host plant physiology and affects the vector insects and plant viruses via bottom-up effects of the host plants. Many studies have shown that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> decreases the plant nitrogen content, which modulates the characteristics of vector insects. Recent evidence also reveals that hormone-dependent signaling pathways play a critical role in regulating the response of insects and plant viruses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>. In the current review, we describe how elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> affects the vector insects and plant viruses by altering the SA and JA signaling pathways. We also discuss how changes in the feeding behavior of vector insects or the occurrence of plant viruses affects the interactions between vector insects and plant viruses under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>. We suggest that new insights into the upstream network that regulates hormone signaling and top-down effects of natural enemies would provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions taking place under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Honggang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Shifan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China. gef@ioz.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China. gef@ioz.ac.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sci China Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101529880", "ISSNLinking": "1674-7305"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6RI5N05OWW", "NameOfSubstance": "jasmonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O414PZ4LPZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Host-Pathogen Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28785951", "10.1007/s11427-017-9126-0", "10.1007/s11427-017-9126-0"]}}]}
