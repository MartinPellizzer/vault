In principle, cluster size, composition, and morphology can be tuned or selected prior to deposition. The newly invented matrix assembly cluster source (MACS) offers one solution to the long-standing problem of low cluster deposition rate. Demonstrations of the cluster activities under realistic reaction conditions are now needed. We deposited elemental silver (Ag) and gold (Au) clusters onto gram-scale powders of commercial titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) to investigate the catalytic oxidation of nitrophenol (a representative pollutant in water) by ozone in aqueous solution, as relevant to the removal of waste drugs from the water supply. A range of techniques, including scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area test, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were employed to reveal the catalyst size, morphology, surface area, and oxidation state. Both the Ag and Au cluster catalysts proved active for the nitrophenol ozonation. The cluster catalysts showed activities at least comparable to those of catalysts made by traditional chemical methods in the literature, demonstrating the potential applications of the cluster beam deposition method for practical heterogeneous catalysis in solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2148-0563"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus, Fabian Way, SwanseaSA1 8EN, U.K."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Rongsheng", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry \"Toso Montanari\", Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento, 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}], "LastName": "Martelli", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4841-8994"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus, Fabian Way, SwanseaSA1 8EN, U.K."}], "LastName": "Vernieres", "ForeName": "Jerome", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry \"Toso Montanari\", Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento, 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}], "LastName": "Albonetti", "ForeName": "Stefania", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry \"Toso Montanari\", Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Viale Risorgimento, 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy."}], "LastName": "Dimitratos", "ForeName": "Nikolaos", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2159-7881"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus, Fabian Way, SwanseaSA1 8EN, U.K."}], "LastName": "Tizaoui", "ForeName": "Chedly", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8728-8083"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus, Fabian Way, SwanseaSA1 8EN, U.K."}], "LastName": "Palmer", "ForeName": "Richard E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32391685", "10.1021/acsami.0c05955"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
