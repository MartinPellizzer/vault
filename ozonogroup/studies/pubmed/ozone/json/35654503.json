This work was designed to explore the transformation and fate of DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in drinking water treatment. The changes of DON and formation of N-DBPs were evaluated along the water treatment route (i.e., pre-ozonation and biological-contact oxidation, delivery pipes' transportation, coagulation-sedimentation, sand filtration, post-ozonation, biological activated carbon, ultrafiltration and disinfection) of drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). The transformation mechanism of DON was comprehensively investigated by molecular weight fractionation, three-dimensional fluorescence, LC-OCD (Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection), total free amino acids. A detailed comparison was made between concentrations and variations of DON and DIN affected by seasons in the drinking water treatment. Regardless of seasonal variation in raw water concentration, the DON removal trends between different treatment processes remain constant in the present study. Compared to other treatment processes, pre-ozonation and coagulation-sedimentation exhibited the dominant DON removal in different seasons, i.e., 11.13%-14.45% and 14.98%-22.49%, respectively. Contrary, biological-contact oxidation and biological activated carbon negatively impacted the DON removal, in which DON increased by 1.76%-6.49% in biological activated carbon. This may be due to the release of soluble microbial products (SMPs) from bacterial metabolism, which was further validated by the rise of biopolymers in LC-OCD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
