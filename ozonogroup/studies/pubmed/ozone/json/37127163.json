We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between residential exposure to air pollutants and the risk of suffering from chronic respiratory diseases in some Italian cities. In the BIGEPI project, we harmonised questionnaire data from two population-based studies conducted in 2007-2014. By combining self-reported diagnoses, symptoms and medication use, we identified cases of rhinitis (n\u00a0=\u00a0965), asthma (n\u00a0=\u00a0328), chronic bronchitis/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CB/COPD, n\u00a0=\u00a0469), and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a02380) belonging to 13 cohorts from 8 Italian cities (Pavia, Turin, Verona, Terni, Pisa, Ancona, Palermo, Sassari). We derived mean residential concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and summer ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) for the period 2013-2015 using spatiotemporal models at a 1\u00a0km resolution. We fitted logistic regression models with controls as reference category, a random-intercept for cohort, and adjusting for sex, age, education, BMI, smoking, and climate. Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD exposures were 28.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (PM<sub>10</sub>), 20.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), 27.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (NO<sub>2</sub>), and 70.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (summer O<sub>3</sub>). The concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> were higher in Northern Italian cities. We found associations between PM exposure and rhinitis (PM<sub>10</sub>: OR 1.62, 95%CI: 1.19-2.20 and PM<sub>2.5</sub>: OR 1.80, 95%CI: 1.16-2.81, per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and between NO<sub>2</sub> exposure and CB/COPD (OR 1.22, 95%CI: 1.07-1.38 per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), whereas asthma was not related to environmental exposures. Results remained consistent using different adjustment sets, including bi-pollutant models, and after excluding subjects who had changed residential address in the last 5\u00a0years. We found novel evidence of association between long-term PM exposure and increased risk of rhinitis, the chronic respiratory disease with the highest prevalence in the general population. Exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, a pollutant characterised by strong oxidative properties, seems to affect mainly CB/COPD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
