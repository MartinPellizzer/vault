In this study, a coupled system consisting of ozonation and moving-bed-biofilm submerged membrane bioreactor (MBBF-SMBR) was comprehensively evaluated for SGW treatment and compared with a similar train comprising ozonation and submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) without addition of carriers attaching biofilm. The average removal rates of MBBF-SMBR were 77.8% for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 37.0% for total nitrogen (TN), higher than those observed in SMBR, namely, 73.9% for DOC and 18.6% for TN. The final total membrane resistance in SMBR was 40.1% higher than that in MBBF-SMBR. Some genera that specifically contribute to organic removal were identified. Enhanced gene allocation for membrane transport and nitrogen metabolism was found in MBBF-SMBR biofilm, implying that this system has significant industrial application potential for organics removal from SGW."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
