The triple-layer structure with Co-doped KMn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub>/Ni<sub>6</sub>MnO<sub>8</sub>/Ni foam was grown spontaneously on the surface of nickel foam by tuning the molar ratio of KMnO<sub>4</sub> to Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O precursors. Importantly, the formed Ni<sub>6</sub>MnO<sub>8</sub> structure between KMn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> and nickel foam during in situ synthesis process effectively protected nickel foam from further etching, which significantly enhanced the reaction stability of catalyst. The optimum amount of Co doping in KMn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> was available when the molar ratio of Mn to Co species in the precursor solution was 2:1. And the Mn2Co1 catalyst had abundant oxygen vacancies and excellent hydrophobicity, thus creating outstanding O<sub>3</sub> decomposition activity. The O<sub>3</sub> conversion under dry conditions and relative humidity of 65%, 90% over a period of 5 hr was 100%, 94% and 80% with the space velocity of 28,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The in situ constructed Co-doped KMn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub>/Ni foam catalyst showed the advantages of low price and gradual applicability of the preparation process, which provided an opportunity for the design of monolithic catalyst for O<sub>3</sub> catalytic decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
