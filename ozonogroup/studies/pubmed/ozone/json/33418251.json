Research concerning O<sub>3</sub> impacts on soybean has focused on the contributions of above-ground tissues. In this study, Mandarin (Ottawa) (O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive) and Fiskeby III (O<sub>3</sub>-tolerant) soybean genotypes provide contrasting materials to investigate O<sub>3</sub> effects on root growth. We compared root morphological and proteomic changes when 16-day-old plants were treated with charcoal-filtered (CF) air or elevated O<sub>3</sub> (80\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub> for 7\u00a0h/day) in continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) for 7\u00a0days. Our results showed that in Mandarin (Ottawa), decreased expression of enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle contributes to reduction of root biomass and diameter under elevated O<sub>3</sub>. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> tolerance in Fiskeby III roots was associated with O<sub>3</sub>-dependent induction of enzymes involved in glycolysis and O<sub>3</sub>-independent expression of enzymes involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. We conclude that a decreased abundance of key redox enzymes in roots due to limited carbon availability rapidly alters root growth under O<sub>3</sub> stress. However, maintaining a high abundance of enzymes associated with redox status and detoxification capability contributes to overall O<sub>3</sub> tolerance in roots."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plant Science Research Unit, Raleigh, 27607, NC, USA; Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, 27695, NC, USA.
