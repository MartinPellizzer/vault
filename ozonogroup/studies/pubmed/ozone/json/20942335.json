Ozone treatment was carried out by spiking ozone stock solutions to solutions containing ERY-ERY:O3 = 1:5 and 1:10 (M:M), while, in parallel, t-BuOH was used as a hydroxyl radical (*OH) scavenger. The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) O3/UV, O3/H2O2, and UV/H2O2 were carried out to recognize and verify possible differences between their primary degradation products; the initial concentrations were ERY:O3 = 1:5 (M:M), ERY:O3:H202 = 1:5:5 (M:M:M), or ERY:H202 = 1:5 (M:M), respectively. Six degradation products were identified from ozonation-one originates from direct ozone attack on the tertiary amine group, while the others arise from radical ion attack, which might be formed during degradation of O3 in water. Fewer primary degradation products were observed arising from *OH-based treatments (AOP) than from ozonation, possibly because the reaction of *OH radicals is non-selective and typically is diffusion-controlled. Four degradation products were detected by *OH radical attacks; two of them already were observed during ozonation, with one as an oxidized ERY molecule and the other as a non-oxidized fragment of the ERY molecule."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LEMA-Laboratory of Energy and Environment, Chemical and Food Engineering Department, Technology Center, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil. danielledebem@yahoo.com.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luiz", "ForeName": "Danielle B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Genena", "ForeName": "Aziza K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Virmond", "ForeName": "Elaine", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jos\u00e9", "ForeName": "Humberto J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Regina F P M", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gebhardt", "ForeName": "Wilhelm", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schr\u00f6der", "ForeName": "Horst Fr", "Initials": "HF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63937KV33D", "NameOfSubstance": "Erythromycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erythromycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20942335", "10.2175/106143010x12609736966928"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
