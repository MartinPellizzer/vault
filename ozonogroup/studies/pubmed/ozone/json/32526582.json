However, the chemical pathways of their reaction with atmospheric ozone are poorly understood. This study investigates the atmospheric ozonolysis mechanism of two typical organic amines-diethylamine and triethylamine using experimental and theoretical methods. Intermediate results from GC-MS and PTR-TOF-MS analysis confirm the formation of eight and eleven nitrogen- and oxygen-containing products during the ozonolysis of diethylamine and triethylamine, respectively. N-ethylethanimine (56.5% in average) or acetaldehyde (64.9% in average) is formed as the dominant product from the ozonolysis of each organic amine. Ozonolysis pathway results indicate that the conversion to N-ethylethanimine is the dominant pathway for diethylamine ozonolysis. At the same time, triethylamine prefers the initial transformation to diethylamine with the discharge of acetaldehyde and then converts to N-ethylethanimine. Higher SOA mass concentration is obtained from the ozonolysis of triethylamine than diethylamine, probably because the former releases a larger amount of intermediate products, especially acetaldehyde. Our results provide a deep insight into the atmospheric processing of organic amines via ozonolysis and the implications of this mechanism for SOA formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
