Half of them exposed to air (A-group, placebo) and the other half exposed to 3 ppm ozone (O-group) for 2 h. Two hours post air/ozone exposure, animals were anesthetized and equally randomized to be pretreated with one of the three treatments, including saline vehicle, dimethylthiourea (DMTU; 500 mg/kg m, a hydroxyl radical scavenger), or phosphoramidon (Phos; 2 mg/kg, an inhibitor for neutral endopeptidase). Ten minutes after pretreatment, half of the animals in each group were i.v. injected with capsaicin (2 microg/kg), and the other half were i.v. injected with substance P (10 microg/kg) to produce Evans blue dye extravasation.", "Nasal exudative response to capsaicin or substance P in O-group was found to be significantly greater than that in A-group. This ozone-induced nasal airway hyperresponsiveness was largely prevented by DMTU. Phosphoramidon produced a similar nasal airway hyperresponsiveness in the A-group, but failed to alter ozone-induced nasal airway hyperresponsiveness in O-group. In sharp contrast, only substance P, but not capsaicin, produced a laryngeal exudative response in the A-group, which was similar to that in the O-group. The laryngeal exudative response to substance P was not significantly affected by DMTU or Phos.", "In the guinea-pig model, hydroxyl radicals play a vital role in the development of ozone-induced nasal airway hyperresponsiveness to tachykinins. It is possibly mediated through the suppressive action of ozone on the tachykinin degradation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan. cyho@vghtpe.gov.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Ching-Yin", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Ching-Ting", "Initials": "CT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Hung-Huey", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kou", "ForeName": "Yu Ru", "Initials": "YR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Rhinol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807268", "ISSNLinking": "1050-6586"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sensory System Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tachykinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8P30PMD17W", "NameOfSubstance": "1,3-dimethylthiourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GYV9AM2QAG", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exudates and Transudates"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Sensory System Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Tachykinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Thiourea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18954503", "10.2500/ajr.2008.22.3208"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
