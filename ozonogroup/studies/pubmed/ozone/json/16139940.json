Treatment of commodities with COS, a highly effective fumigant, results in residues that are near or indistinguishable to natural background levels of this compound. COS is a naturally occurring gas, being the predominant sulfur moiety in the atmosphere, occurs naturally in food and is a normal by-product of mammalian aerobic metabolism. COS has low acute inhalational toxicity but with a steep dose response curve; COS is neither genotoxic nor a developmental toxicant but does reversibly impair male fertility. Prolonged, repeated exposure to COS is likely to present similar neurotoxicity hazards to that of the structurally and toxicologically related compound carbon disulfide. Although the occupational risks presented by COS as a fumigant of bulk grain are significant, these are, as they have been for a considerable time for phosphine and methyl bromide, manageable by good occupational safety practices. Consideration may need to be given to scrubbing of ventilated COS and its breakdown product hydrogen sulfide, at the completion of fumigation to minimise worker and bystander exposure. In terms of classical regulatory toxicology studies, the available database for COS is deficient in many aspects and registration in most jurisdictions will depend on sound scientific argument built upon the totality of the existing scientific data as there are strong arguments supporting the registration of this compound."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Entomology, GPO Box 1700, Canberra ACT 2602, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartholomaeus", "ForeName": "Andrew R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haritos", "ForeName": "Victoria S", "Initials": "VS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "871UI0ET21", "NameOfSubstance": "carbonyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}], "NumberOfReferences": "93"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16139940", "10.1016/j.fct.2005.06.016", "S0278-6915(05)00240-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
