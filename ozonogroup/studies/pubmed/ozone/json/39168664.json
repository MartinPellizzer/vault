The impact of key meteorological factors and regional transport on O<sub>3</sub> and VOCs was investigated. The results showed that the mean value of atmospheric <i>\u03c6</i>\uff08VOCs\uff09 during summer in the suburban area of Shanghai was \uff0820.91 \u00b1 9.82\uff09\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and the largest proportion of each component was with alkanes and OVOCs, both of which were 30.2%. The mean value of <i>\u03c6</i>\uff08VOCs\uff09 on O<sub>3</sub> polluted days was \uff0823.84 \u00b1 9.69\uff09\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, which was 28.1% higher than that on clean days. The OFP of VOCs on polluted days was 126.92 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, which was 31.9% higher than that on clean days. The contribution of olefins to OFP accounted for a significant increase, and species such as propylene and acetone were the most significant compared to on clean days, indicating that these components and species need to be the focus of mitigation. The variation characteristics of the ratio of ethane to acetylene \uff08E/E\uff09 and the ratio of <i>m</i>/<i>p</i>-xylene to ethylbenzene\uff08X/E\uff09 indicated that there was a significant regional transport influence of the summer air masses in the suburban area of Shanghai, and it occurred mainly in the afternoon and at night. The results of the pollution rose diagram and the backward trajectory of air masses indicated that air masses from the south and southwest directions had the greatest influence on the transport of VOCs in suburban Shanghai. In particular, it is necessary to focus on controlling olefin and OVOCs from southern air masses and aromatic hydrocarbons from southwestern air masses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39168664", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202307220"]}}]}
