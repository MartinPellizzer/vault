We employ a brute-force zero-out sensitivity method to estimate the impact of wildland fire emissions on air quality across the contiguous US using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modelling system. These simulations are designed to assess the importance of wildland fire emissions on CMAQ model performance and are not intended for regulatory assessments. CMAQ ver. 5.0.1 estimated that fires contributed 11% to the mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> and less than 1% to the mean O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during 2008-2012. Adding fires to CMAQ increases the number of 'grid-cell days' with PM<sub>2.5</sub> above 35 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> by a factor of 4 and the number of grid-cell days with maximum daily 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> above 70 ppb by 14%. Although CMAQ simulations of specific fires have improved with the latest model version (e.g. for the 2008 California wildfire episode, the correlation <i>r</i> = 0.82 with CMAQ ver. 5.0.1 <i>v. r</i> = 0.68 for CMAQ ver. 4.7.1), the model still exhibits a low bias at higher observed concentrations and a high bias at lower observed concentrations. Given the large impact of wildland fire emissions on simulated concentrations of elevated PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, improvements are recommended on how these emissions are characterised and distributed vertically in the model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Computational Exposure Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkins", "ForeName": "Joseph L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Computational Exposure Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pouliot", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Computational Exposure Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foley", "ForeName": "Kristen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Computational Exposure Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Appel", "ForeName": "Wyat", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, Computational Exposure Division, National Exposure Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierce", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Int J Wildland Fire", "NlmUniqueID": "101699224", "ISSNLinking": "1049-8001"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akagi SK, Craven JS, Taylor JW, McMeeking GR, Yokelson RJ, Burling IR, Urbanski SP, Wold CE, Seinfeld JH, Coe H, Alvarado MJ, Weise DR (2012) Evolution of trace gases and particles emitted by a chaparral fire in California.
