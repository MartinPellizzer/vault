Prior to comparison, catalyst used in heterogenous catalytic O<sub>3</sub> and operation parameters for each technology were optimized. The COD removal of CuO@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> under its optimal parameters was 57.2%, which failed to meet the standard (\u226575%). In contrast, the COD removal by UV/O<sub>3</sub> could be 82.3%. The superior efficiency of UV/O<sub>3</sub> over CuO@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> could be summarized into three aspects: (I) Cu bounded \u00b7OH (\u2261Cu-O\u00b7) preferentially attacked hydrophilic groups, while free hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) was non-selective, thus UV/O<sub>3</sub> exhibited a unique three-stage mechanism; (II) The oxidation potential of \u2261Cu-O\u00b7 was higher than that of \u00b7OH, therefore was more vulnerable to the negative effect of radical self-quenching; (III) The existence of UV-induced excited states made organics in UV/O<sub>3</sub> more active than in CuO@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system, thus high concentration of anions enhanced COD removal in UV/O<sub>3</sub> but affected that in CuO@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>. The study further revealed the characteristics of heterogeneous catalytic O<sub>3</sub> and UV/O<sub>3</sub>, and UV induced excited state should be considered in UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
