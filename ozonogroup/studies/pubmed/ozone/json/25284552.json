The dentin specimens prepared from those teeth were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 15 min. The frozen composition was titrated in a mixer and the obtained dentin powder was kept frozen at -70\u00b0C until use. Ten groups of 50mg dentin powder were immersed in agents (A: Ozone for 100 or 200 sec, B: 5.25% NaOCl, C: 2.25% NaOCl, D: 2% Chlorhexidine, E: 0.9% NaCl (control)) for 5 or 10 min. An Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (ATR FT-IR) was used to analyze dentin powder. The data were statistically analyzed by using Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance.", "In all groups, collagen degradation was significantly increased compared to the control and 2% CHX groups (p<0.05). The use of ozone increased collagen degradation significantly compared to the use of 2.25% NaOCl and 2% Chlorhexidine for 5 min (p < 0.05).
