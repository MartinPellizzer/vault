Certain components of mineral dust aerosol, such as semiconductor metal oxides, can act as chromophores that initiate chemical reactions, while adsorbed organic and inorganic species may also be photoactive. However, relatively little is known about the impact of heterogeneous photochemistry of mineral dust aerosol in the atmosphere. In this study, we investigate the heterogeneous photochemistry of trace atmospheric gases including HNO(3) and O(3) with components of mineral dust aerosol using an environmental aerosol chamber that incorporates a solar simulator. For reaction of HNO(3) with aluminum oxide, broadband irradiation initiates photoreactions to form gaseous NO and NO(2). A complex dynamic balance between surface adsorbed nitrate and gaseous nitrogen oxide products including NO and NO(2) is observed. For heterogeneous photoreactions of O(3), iron oxide shows catalytic decompositions toward O(3) while aluminum oxide is deactivated by ozone exposure. Furthermore, the role of relative humidity, and, thus, adsorbed water, on heterogeneous photochemistry has been explored. The atmospheric implications of these results are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Haihan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Navea", "ForeName": "Juan G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "Mark A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grassian", "ForeName": "Vicki H", "Initials": "VH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21210685", "10.1021/jp110164j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
