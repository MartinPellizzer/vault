The dosage of various air pollutants during exercise is much higher due to the marked increase in ventilatory rate and concomitant nasal and oral breathing. This is particularly true for sulfur dioxide which is a highly water-soluble gas and is normally absorbed in the upper airway during nasal breathing. With heavy exercise, oral pharyngeal breathing is the predominant mode of breathing and much larger amounts of sulfur dioxide are delivered to the lower airway resulting in significant impact upon the lower respiratory tract. More recently, several controlled human studies have shown that a combination of exercise and air pollutants such as ozone (O3) or sulfur dioxides (SO2) cause a significant increase in bronchoconstriction and air flow obstruction when compared to the same exposure at rest. In strenuous athletic competition such as the Olympic Games where small increments of time often determine the ultimate success of athletes, the impact of air pollutants and subsequent adverse ventilatory changes can affect athletic performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Univ. of Washington, Seattle 98105."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierson", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Allergy Proc", "NlmUniqueID": "8902396", "ISSNLinking": "1046-9354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sports"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}], "NumberOfReferences": "62"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2670670", "10.2500/108854189778960144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
