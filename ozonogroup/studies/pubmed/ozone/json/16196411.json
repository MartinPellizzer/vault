Humic substances were extracted from the Han River water and analyzed using the samples obtained before/after ozonation with various analytical items. Ozonation was conducted in a batch-type reactor, and ozone was dosed from 0 to 2.0 mg O3 mg(-1) humic substances. The humic fraction was 56.0% of total organic carbon in the Han River and the ratio of fulvic to humic acids was approximately 3.46, including aromatic ring structures and/or various functional groups. Humic substances could not completely be oxidized to CO2, H2O, etc., but partly oxidized to low molecular weight matter, thus low removal efficiencies in terms of dissolved organic carbon (31% at 1.0 mg O3 mg(-1) humic substances) were observed. For UV absorbance at the wavelength 254 nm, ozone dose at 1.0 mg O3 mg(-1) humic substances showed more than 80% removal efficiencies. The molar ratios of H/C and O/C of the humic substances structure relatively increased by ozonation, indicating the degradation of aromatic groups in the humic substances molecule. The Fourier transform infrared spectra and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of humic substances showed the increase in carboxylic acids and the decrease in aromatic protons through ozonation, respectively. As specific reaction sites in the humic substances including aromatic ring structures were reduced through ozone oxidation, contents of carboxylic acids, ketones and quinones in the humic substances molecule increased."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The University of Seoul, Department of Environmental Engineering, 90 Junnondong, Dongdaemungu, Seoul 130-743, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16196411", "10.1080/09593332608618489"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
