Human population growth has only recently become problematic, with overpopulation having led to serious social and environmental problems such as poverty, overcrowded slums, crime, terrorism, air and water pollution, and the depletion of the ozone layer. Few listened to warnings of the danger of runaway human population growth, with 2 US presidents welcoming such growth as a stimulus to economic development. More modern contraceptives are sorely needed. Contraceptive research, however, is being impeded by hostile attitudes and the high cost in time and money of bringing a new contraceptive to an uncertain market with the threat of litigation. At the current growth rate, human population size will double in the next century to a level most likely beyond the carrying capacity of the planet.

Currently, overpopulation has led to serious social and environmental problems such as poverty, overcrowded slums, crime, terrorism, pollution of air and water, and depletion of the protective ozone layer. Warnings were sounded, but few listened. The enthusiasm once generated for solving the problem of too many people was short-lived. The press with puzzling abrogation of its responsibility to the public managed to allay all fears of population overgrowth. Two U.S. presidents welcomed such growth as a stimulus to economic development. Although modern contraceptives are safe, effective, and widely available, more are badly needed, but none are in the pipeline. Research is being hampered by hostile attitudes and by the high cost in time and money of bringing a new contraceptive to an uncertain market with the added threat of litigation.
