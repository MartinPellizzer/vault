Most studies investigated future hypothetical scenarios of increased cycling. The impact on the general population was estimated using a comparative risk assessment approach in the majority of these studies, whereas some used previously published cost estimates. Air pollution exposure during cycling was estimated based on the ventilation rate, the pollutant concentration, and the trip duration. Most studies employed exposure-response functions from studies comparing background levels of fine particles between cities to estimate the health impacts of local traffic emissions. The effect of air pollution associated with increased cycling contributed small health benefits for the general population, and also only slightly increased risks associated with fine particle exposure among those who shifted to cycling. However, studies calculating health impacts based on exposure-response functions for ozone, black carbon or nitrogen oxides found larger effects attributed to changes in air pollution exposure.", "A large discrepancy between studies was observed due to different health impact assessment approaches, different assumptions for calculation of inhaled dose and different selection of dose-response functions. This kind of assessments would improve from more holistic approaches using more specific exposure-response functions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 , Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raza", "ForeName": "Wasif", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 , Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forsberg", "ForeName": "Bertil", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry , Stockholm University , Stockholm , Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Environment and Health Administration , SLB , Stockholm , Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johansson", "ForeName": "Christer", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 , Sweden."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8854-498X"], "LastName": "Sommar", "ForeName": "Johan Nilsson", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Glob Health Action", "NlmUniqueID": "101496665", "ISSNLinking": "1654-9880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicycling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Health Impact Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "CoiStatement": "No potential conflict of interest was reported by authors"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Antrop M.
