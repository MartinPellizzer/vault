Photoelectron spectra recorded as a function of reaction time have been used to estimate partial pressures of the reagents and products, using photoionization cross-sections for selected photoelectron bands of the reagents and products, which have been measured separately. Product yields compare favourably with results of other studies, and the production of oxygen and acetaldehyde have been measured as a function of time for the first time. A reaction scheme developed for the ozone-ethene reaction has been used to simulate the reagents and products as a function of time. The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. For each of the observed products, the simulations allow the main reaction (or reactions) for production of that product to be established. The product yields have been used in a global model to estimate their global annual emissions in the atmosphere. Of particular interest are the calculated global annual emissions of formaldehyde (0.96 \u00b1 0.10 Tg) and formic acid, (0.05 \u00b1 0.01 Tg) which are estimated as 0.04% and 0.7% of the total annual emission respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "This journal is \u00a9 the Owner Societies 2011"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Copeland", "ForeName": "Grant", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Mariana V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shallcross", "ForeName": "Dudley E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dyke", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21701711", "10.1039/c0cp03004j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
