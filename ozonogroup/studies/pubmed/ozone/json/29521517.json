Cured or improved dermatophytosis patients could become reinfected if exposed to fungal reservoirs, such as an infected shoe, sock, or textile. To prevent this, footwear, sock, and textile sanitization methods can be used. To provide insight into effective sanitization options, the focus of this article is to review footwear, sock, and textile sanitization studies conducted throughout history (1920-2016). Thirty-three studies are covered in this review, encompassing techniques ranging from formaldehyde fumigation and foot powder application, to more modern approaches such as UV light and silver-light irradiation technologies. Older sanitization methods (eg, boiling, use of chlorine and salts) are quite limited in their practicality, as they can result in health complications and ruin shoe integrity. Newer approaches to shoe and sock sanitization, such as ozone application and UV irradiation, have shown very promising results. Further research is still needed with these modern techniques, as knowledge gaps and cost prevent the creation of standardized parameters for successful use. By combining sanitization methods with other preventative measures, protection against reinfection may be enhanced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Aditya K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Versteeg", "ForeName": "Sarah G", "Initials": "SG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Podiatr Med Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "8501423", "ISSNLinking": "1930-8264"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatomycoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foot"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shoes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29521517", "10.7547/17-043"]}}]}
