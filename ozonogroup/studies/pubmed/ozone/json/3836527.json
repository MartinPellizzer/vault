The results suggest that levels are quite moderate, but studies of actual reactions by passengers and cabin crew indicate rather strong, objective effects. These consist of irritation of the mucous membranes of eye, nose and throat as well as perception of bad odours. Evidently, environmental tobacco smoke causes distress in aircraft already at lower concentrations than under ground conditions, probably because of special climatic conditions such as ultra-low air humidity, elevated levels of ozone, subnormal air pressure and, eventually, disturbance of the concentration of light air ions. None of these abnormalities can easily be eliminated. Ventilation, however effective in terms of rate of air changes, can not effectively curb local peak concentrations, and, close to a smoker the concentration of smoke may be 100 times as high as the room average. Therefore, aircraft must provide separate smoking resp non-smoking areas. Area division along an aisle is unacceptable since the ventilation system makes the aisle and adjacent seats on both sides be located in one whirl of common air. WHO will try to stimulate improvements of airline practices and aircraft design."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Tokai J Exp Clin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7704186", "ISSNLinking": "0385-0005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude to Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microclimate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking Prevention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "World Health Organization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3836527"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
