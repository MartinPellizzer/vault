The lung functions of apparently healthy adolescents (12-15 years) residing in two zones were measured for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75.", "A total of 302 adolescents (142, zone 1 and 160, zone 2) resided in the study area, with higher than permissible concentrations of PM10 and ozone at both places. Abnormal lung functions were seen in a higher proportion of adolescents in zone 1 than zone 2 (23% and 14%; P=0.04). A significantly lower mean (SD) FEV1 was seen in adolescents in zone 1 than zone 2 [2.9 (0.5) vs. 3.2 (0.4) L, P = 0.04]. A higher proportion of abnormal FEV1/FVC ratio% was seen in zone 1 than 2 (12% vs. 6%, P=0.04), suggestive of an obstructive pattern on spirometry. Higher risk (b 95% CI) for abnormal lung functions was seen with the zone [2.2 (1.1-4.2)], diagnosis of asthma [5.74 (2.4-13.2)], and living within 500 meters from a brickwork [1.8 (1.0-2.5)].", "High exposure to PM10, ozone and living near brickwork were associated with reduced lung function in adolescents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, UMAE Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda CMNO, IMSS, Guadalajara, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Hernandez-Raygoza", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Research Division, UMAE Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda CMNO, IMSS, Guadalajara, Mexico.
