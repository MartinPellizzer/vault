Results showed that net photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and lipid peroxidation were significantly reduced after 6, 12 and 24 months of exposure to elevated ozone (eO<sub>3</sub>) whereas stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were significantly decreased after 12 months of exposure to eO<sub>3</sub>. Antioxidant enzymatic activities (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) were significantly increased after 12 months of exposure to eO<sub>3.</sub> Ascorbate was increased significantly after 6 and 12 months of exposure to eO<sub>3</sub> while reduced glutathione content declined significantly after 6 and 24 months of exposure to eO<sub>3</sub>. The study showed that there were several negative long lasting physiological and biochemical responses in Leucaena. The results provide evidence that Leucaena exhibited greater sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub> during initial exposure (up to 12 months) but showed moderate tolerance by the end of the 2nd year."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
