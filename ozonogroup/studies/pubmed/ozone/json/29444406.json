These reactions were investigated using liquid chromatography coupled to the electrospray ionization and quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS). The rate coefficients determined for LA + OH reaction were: 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH = 2 and 5.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH = 10. The rate coefficient determined for LA ozonolysis was 4.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH = 2. The calculated Henry's law constant (H) for LA was ca. 6.3 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M \u00d7 atm<sup>-1</sup>, thereby indicating that in fogs and clouds with LWC = 0.3-0.5 g \u00d7 m<sup>-3</sup> LA will reside entirely in the aqueous phase. Calculated atmospheric lifetimes due to reaction with OH and O<sub>3</sub> strongly indicate that aqueous-phase oxidation can be important for LA under realistic atmospheric conditions. Under acidic conditions, the aqueous-phase oxidation of LA by OH will dominate over reaction with O<sub>3</sub>, whereas the opposite is more likely when pH \u2265 4.5. The aqueous-phase oxidation of LA produced keto-limononic acid and a number of low-volatility products, such as hydroperoxy-LA and \u03b1-hydroxyhydroperoxides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Warsaw , Faculty of Chemistry , Al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101 , 02-089 Warsaw , Poland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9483-4692"], "LastName": "Witkowski", "ForeName": "Bart\u0142omiej", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Warsaw , Faculty of Chemistry , Al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101 , 02-089 Warsaw , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurdana", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Warsaw , Faculty of Chemistry , Al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101 , 02-089 Warsaw , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gierczak", "ForeName": "Tomasz", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29444406", "10.1021/acs.est.7b04867"]}}]}
