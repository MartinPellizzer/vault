It is necessary for the safety of both the patient and the healthcare professional. Yet during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, PPE scarcity in many countries, including the United States, has impacted the level of care for patients and the safety of healthcare personnel. Additionally, the implementation of mandatory mask mandates for the general public in many countries forced individuals to either reuse PPE, which can contribute to poor hygiene, or buy PPE in bulk and thereby contribute to the scarcity of PPE. In this study, we investigate the possibility of using a cost-effective ozone sterilization unit on contaminated N95 masks as an alternative to current sterilization methods.", "This protocol examined ozone's ability to decontaminate N95 mask fabric that was exposed to a surrogate virus (<i>Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2</i>). Once the sterilization unit achieves an ozone concentration of ~30 ppm, a 60-minute or 120-minute sterilization cycle commences. Following the sterilization cycle, we investigated the amount of viable virus on the slide using a viral plaque assay and compared it to a non-sterilized, control slide. Furthermore, we carried out trials to investigate the safety of an ozone sterilization device, by measuring the levels of ozone exposure that individuals may experience when operating the sterilization unit post-cycle.", "We showed that a 120-minute sterilization cycle at ~30 ppm achieves a 3-log reduction in viral activity, thereby complying with industry and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Further, we demonstrated that when following our protocol, the ozone exposure levels for a simple sterilization unit to be used at home complied with federal and industry standards.", "Ozone may have the potential to decontaminate masks and other PPE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021, Stolle et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Oxford University, Oxford, GBR."}], "LastName": "Stolle", "ForeName": "Lucas", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, USA."}], "LastName": "Nalamasu", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, Delta Faucet Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}], "LastName": "Rodenbeck", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, Delta Faucet Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}], "LastName": "Davidson", "ForeName": "Kyle", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, Delta Faucet Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}], "LastName": "Smarelli", "ForeName": "Caitlin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, Delta Faucet Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}], "LastName": "Rosko", "ForeName": "Scot", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, Delta Faucet Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."}], "LastName": "Wales", "ForeName": "Josh", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, NEMA Research, Inc., Naples, USA."}], "LastName": "LeQuang", "ForeName": "Jo Ann K", "Initials": "JAK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiology, Native Cardio Inc., Naples, USA."}], "LastName": "Pergolizzi", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sourcing personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
