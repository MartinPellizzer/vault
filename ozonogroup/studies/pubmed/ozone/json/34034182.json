Based on the continuous observation during four seasons, the seasonal characteristics, chemical reactivity and source apportionment of 116 VOCs species were studied in a typical semi-arid city with no relevant research. The results showed that the annual average concentrations of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) in Hohhot was 44.67 \u00b1 46.59 ppbv with the predominant of alkanes and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs). The sharp increment of TVOCs were explained by the elevating OVOCs and alkanes in autumn, while alkanes and alkenes in winter. The levels of alkenes presented negative and positive correlations with solar radiation and PM<sub>10</sub>, respectively. The mixing ratios accounted for 30% (alkanes) and 23% (alkenes and aromatics) of the TVOCs, respectively; while their ozone formation potential (OFP) ~15% and nearly 50% (even 75% in winter), respectively, indicating that the OFP of different VOCs species depends not only on their concentrations but more importantly on their chemical activity in atmosphere. According to the seasonal source apportionment, both the high levels of short-chain alkanes, alkenes and aromatics and the increasing coal sales volume suggested that the combustion sources were the predominant in heating seasons, while solvent uses was extracted as the most predominant during non-heating seasons. In non-heating seasons, the biogenic emission sources, ranking as the second contributor, were significantly higher than heating seasons. Isoprene was the most active biogenic VOCs species, bagging test results showed that deciduous trees were the predominant contributors for isoprene (~99%), while coniferous trees and shrub for monoterpenes (>95%).
