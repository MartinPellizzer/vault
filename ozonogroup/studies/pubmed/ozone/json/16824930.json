In previous papers we have shown that intra-rectal (i.r.) ozone/oxygen mixture protected and induced a significant recovery in cisplatin-induced renal damage and was related to a significant increase in the antioxidant system in renal tissue.", "This study was undertaken to examine the effect of the ir applications of ozone/oxygen mixture in the renal expression pattern of Bax proteins in rats treated with cisplatin. A group of male Sprague-Dawley rats was pretreated with 15 i.r. applications of ozone/oxygen (1.1 mg/kg) before intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (6 mg/kg). Another group was treated with five i.r. applications of ozone/oxygen mixture after cisplatin administration. Serum creatinine was measured thereafter. Subcellular distribution of Bax in renal tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.", "Ozone pretreatment prevented the increase in serum creatinine levels and completely inhibited the acute tubular necrosis induced by cisplatin in renal tissue, diminishing the expression of Bax. Ozone treatment after cisplatin application reduced the increase in serum creatinine levels and the renal necrosis, inducing a lesser decrease of the Bax expression in cisplatin-treated kidneys.", "Expression of Bax in renal tissue seems to play an important role in the protection and recovery in cisplatin-nephrotoxicity achieved by ozone/oxygen mixture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Laboratory for the Control of Drugs, Center for the Control and Development of Drugs, Havana, Cuba. aluetborrego@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borrego", "ForeName": "Aluet", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamora", "ForeName": "Zullyt Barbara", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "Ricardo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romay", "ForeName": "Cheyla", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Men\u00e9ndez", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berlanga", "ForeName": "Jorge", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montero", "ForeName": "Teresita", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9312706", "ISSNLinking": "0188-4409"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bax protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16824930", "10.1016/j.arcmed.2006.02.008", "S0188-4409(06)00097-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
