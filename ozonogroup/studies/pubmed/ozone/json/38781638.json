To mitigate the disruptive consequences of artificial sunscreens, photoprotective compounds synthesized from gram-negative, oxygenic, and photoautotrophic prokaryote, cyanobacteria have been studied. In a quest to counteract the harmful UV radiation, cyanobacterial species biosynthesize photoprotective metabolites named as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). The investigation of MAAs as potential substitutes for commercial sunscreen compounds is motivated by their inherent characteristics, such as antioxidative properties, water solubility, low molecular weight, and high molar extinction coefficients. These attributes contribute to the stability of MAAs and make them promising candidates for natural alternatives in sunscreen formulations. They are effective at reducing direct damage caused by UV radiation and do not lead to the production of reactive oxygen radicals. In order to better understand the role, ecology, and its application at a commercial scale, tools like genome mining, heterologous expression, and synthetic biology have been explored in this review to develop next-generation sunscreens. Utilizing tactical concepts of bio-nanoconjugate formation for the development of an efficient MAA-nanoparticle conjugate structure would not only give the sunscreen complex stability but would also serve as a promising tool for the production of analogues. This review would provide insight on efforts to produce MAAs by diversifying the biosynthetic pathways, modulating the precursors and stress conditions, and comprehending the gene cluster arrangement for MAA biosynthesis and its application in developing effective sunscreen."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
