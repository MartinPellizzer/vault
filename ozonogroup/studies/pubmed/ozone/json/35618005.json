We investigated the association between ultra-short-term exposure to air pollution and risk of childhood asthma exacerbations. Hourly data on emergency department visits (EDVs) for asthma in children during 2013-2015 in Brisbane, Australia, were obtained. We undertook time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the hourly association between exposure to air pollutants (particles with diameter \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), particles with diameter \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)) and risk of EDVs for asthma after controlling for temperature, relative humidity, public holidays and circulating levels of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Risk of EDVs for asthma increased within a few hours after exposure to O<sub>3</sub> (odds ratio [OR]: 1.170, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003-1.365) or NO<sub>2</sub> (OR: 1.359, 95%CI: 1.049-1.760). The association between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was stronger in boys (OR: 1.244, 95%CI: 1.025-1.511) than that in girls (OR: 1.055, 95%CI: 0.818-1.361). The association between NO<sub>2</sub> exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was stronger in school-age children [OR ranged from 1.376 (95%CI: 1.044-1.813) to 3.607 (95%CI: 1.552-8.385) across different lags] than that in preschool-age children, whereas the association between PM<sub>10</sub> exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was greater in preschool-age children [OR ranged from 1.873 (95%CI: 1.022-3.433) to 1.878 (95%CI: 1.028-3.431)] than that in school-age children. We observed an association of risk of EDVs for asthma with daytime air pollution exposure, but not with night-time air pollution exposure. This study suggests that risk of childhood asthma exacerbations increases within a few hours of air pollution exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
