However, the mortality burden of ozone and related economic loss has not been fully characterized. This study aimed to estimate the ozone-mortality association in Italy and evaluate attributable mortality burden and related economic loss in 2015-2019. We collected daily all-cause mortality data stratified by age and sex from 2015 to 2019 in 107 provinces of Italy. A two-stage time-series framework was applied to estimate the association between daily maximum eight-hour average ozone and mortality as well as economic loss. An overall increase in the risk of mortality (RR=1.0043, 95% CI: 1.0029, 1.0057) was associated with every 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in ozone. Generally, a total of 70,060 deaths and $65 billion economic loss were attributed to ozone exposure, corresponding to 3.11% of mortality and about 0.5% of the national GDP during the study period, respectively. The highest ozone-related mortality burden (30,910 deaths) and economic loss ($29.24 billion) were observed in the hot season. This nationwide study suggested considerable mortality burden and economic loss were associated with exposure to ozone. More actions and policies should be proposed to reduce ozone levels and help the public protect their health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
