This work demonstrates the fabrication of high quality Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) nanocrystal assemblies with limited overlapping and higher coverage by systemically and combinatorially optimizing the parameters of compression pressure and quantity of spread nanocrystals. Monodispersed iron oxide nanocrystals with a diameter of 11.8 nm were synthesized by thermal decomposition of Fe(CO)5 in trioctylamine with the presence of oleic acid. Multilayer nanocrystal assemblies were obtained through a layer-by-layer (LBL) process by repeating the transfer procedure after their hydrophilicity had been improved via treatment in a UV-ozone oven. The quality of nanocrystal assemblies was investigated by UV-vis spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy. The nanomagnetism for the nanostructures of different combination manners was studied systemically by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). A lower superparamagnetic blocking temperature was found in the monolayer Fe3O4 nanocrystal assembly. The superparamagnetic blocking temperature in magnetic nanocrystal assemblies could be tuned through modifying the interparticle interactions among the interlayer and intralayers by controlling the layer number of the assemblies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Group of Ionic Liquids Clean Process and Energy-saving, Key Laboratory of Green Process and Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, P.
