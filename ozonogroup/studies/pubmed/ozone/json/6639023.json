The growth rate was found to fluctuate between 6.94 X 10(-3) and 8.68 X 10(-4) doublings per h. The microbiological removal of total organic carbon (TOC) was calculated by considering the GAC contactors as semiclosed continuous culture systems and using growth yield factors determined in laboratory experiments. After ozonation, the average TOC entering the contactors was 1,488 micrograms/liter, and the average effluent TOC was 497 micrograms/liter. Microbiological TOC removal was found to average 240 micrograms/liter on GAC contactors, which was not significantly different from microbiological TOC (220 micrograms/liter) removal across a parallel sand contactor where no adsorption took place. Thus, GAC did not appear to enhance biological TOC removal. Bacterial growth and maintenance was responsible for approximately 24% of the TOC removal on GAC under the conditions of this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bancroft", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maloney", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McElhaney", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suffet", "ForeName": "I H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pipes", "ForeName": "W O", "Initials": "WO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sanitary Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1981 Jan;41(1):216-21", "ArticleIdList": ["16345688"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1980 Jun;39(6):1198-204", "ArticleIdList": ["16345582"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6639023", "PMC239334", "10.1128/aem.46.3.683-688.1983"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
