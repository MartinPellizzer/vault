The composition of all three SEC fractions showed strong changes and a relative increase of the low molecular weight anions. Further mass spectrometric investigations focused on the low molecular weight fulvic acid molecules, where a preferential removal of fulvic acid molecules with a low oxidation state (low O/C ratio) and a high degree of unsaturation (low H/C ratio) was observed. Besides their elemental composition, also the structure of the fulvic acid molecules influenced their reactivity toward ozone. The data suggestthat molecules with a more extended carbon skeleton and less carboxylate substituents showed higher reactivitywhereas some highly unsaturated molecules did not show measurable removal up to a specific ozone dose of 2.5 mg/mg of DOC due to sterical shielding of the reactive structures. Newly formed molecules were determined by SEC-Q-TOF-MS, which were characterized by a very high number of carboxylate groups (high O/C ratio) and a highly saturated carbon skeleton (high H/C ratio). These investigations explain on a molecular level many observations previously made with whole mixtures or fractions of natural organic matter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Quality Control, Technical University of Berlin, Sekr KF 4, Strasse des 17 Juni 135, 10623 Berlin, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "These", "ForeName": "Anja", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reemtsma", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16294877", "10.1021/es050941h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
