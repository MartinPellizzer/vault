The ocean plays important and complex roles in the global biogeochemical cycles of methyl bromide, not only the source of atmospheric methyl bromide, but also the sink. Therefore, developing the chemical research of the soluble methyl bromide in the ocean, will not only have a certain guiding significance to the atmospheric ozone layer protection, but also provide a theoretical basis for estimating methyl bromide's contribution to the global environmental change on global scale. This paper reviewed the research advances on methyl bromide in the ocean, from the aspects of the biogeochemical cycle of methyl bromide in the ocean, the analysis and determination method, the concentration distribution, the sea-to-air flux and its sources and sinks in the atmosphere. Some deficiencies in the current studies were put forward, and the directions of the future studies were prospected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Hui-na", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Wen-xia", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Yu-qian", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jian-lei", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Si-yuan", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oceans and Seas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25876424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
