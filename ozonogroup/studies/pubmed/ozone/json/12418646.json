For example, Ford has been developing and implementing such a measure at its facilities worldwide to provide technical guidance for controlling Legionella in water systems. One of the key issues for implementing the measure is the selection of a disinfectant(s) and optimum conditions for its use. Therefore, available publications on various disinfectants and disinfection processes used for the inactivation of Legionella bacteria were reviewed. Two disinfection methods were reviewed: chemical and thermal. For chemical methods, disinfectants used were metal ions (copper and silver), oxidizing agents (halogen containing compounds [chlorine, bromine, iodine, chlorine dioxide, chloramines, and halogenated hydantoins], ozone, and hydrogen peroxide), non-oxidizing agents (heterocyclic ketones, guanidines, thiocarbamates, aldehydes, amines, thiocyanates, organo-tin compounds, halogenated amides, and halogenated glycols), and UV light. In general, oxidizing disinfectants were found to be more effective than non-oxidizing ones. Among oxidizing agents, chlorine is known to be effective and widely used. Among non-oxidizing agents, 2,2-dibromo-3-nitropropionamide appears to be the most effective followed by glutaraldehyde. Isothiazolin (known as Kathon), polyhexamethylene biguanide, and 2-bromo-2-nitropropionamide (known as Bronopol) were found to be less effective than glutaraldehyde. Thermal disinfection is effective at > 60 degrees C (140 degrees F)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ford Research Laboratory, Dearborn, MI 48121, USA. bkim@ford.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mueller", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gaines", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kendall", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Legionella"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Legionnaires' Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}], "NumberOfReferences": "68"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12418646", "10.1016/s0043-1354(02)00188-4", "S0043-1354(02)00188-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
