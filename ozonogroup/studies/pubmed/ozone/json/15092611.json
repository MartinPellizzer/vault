In combination with acidic mist, O(3) has been observed to increase ion leaching. Besides cations lake Mg(2+), Ca(2+), K(+), NH(4)(+), considerable amounts of nitrate were found to be leached by acidic mist from needles of Norway spruce. Controlled fumigation experiments, with 100, 300, and 600 microg O(3)m(-3) over 22 days continuously, have led to a nitrate accumulation of 94.1 +/- 14.8, 119.4 +/- 28.7 and 198.9 +/- 14.9 microg NO(3)(-1) g(-1) FW, respectively, in leaves of Quercus robur. Similar values were found in leaves of Fagus sylvatica and current and previous year needles of Picea abies. Nitrate levels of controls receiving charcoal filtered air were well below 40 microg NO(3)(-) g (-1) FW. Statistically significant elevated nitrate levels were observed after only 48 h of continuous fumigation with 600 microg O(3)m(-3), in all tree species tested, and after 144 h in the 100 microg O(3)m(-3) treatment. In another experiment, trees of Picea abies were kept in two charcoal (C) and two Purafil plus charcoal (P/C) ventilated chambers, and fumigated with O and 500 microg O(3)m(-3) in cabinets of each filter-type in order to eliminate NO(x) from chamber air. After 29 days of continuous ozone fumigation, NO(3)(-) accumulation in needles amounted to 102.0 +/- 37.7 and 137.4 +/- 40.5 microg g(-1) FW in P/C and C-filtered chambers, respectively. Nitrate contents of controls were below 30 microg NO(3)(-)g(-1) FW at the end of the experiment. No significant differences in NO(3)(-) accumulation between filter treatments were observed. Since NO(x) was reduced by more than 95% in the Purafil/charcoal versus the charcoal treatment, NO(3)(-) accumulation in needles can be attributed predominantly to the influence of ozone and not to direct NO(2) uptake of needles by the possible oxidation of NO to NO(2) in the presence of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Immissionsschutz des Landes NRW, Wallneyer Strasse 6, 4300 Essen, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krause", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092611", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90085-1", "0269-7491(88)90085-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
