Experiments results showed that the removal efficiency (\u03b7H2S) of H2S was decreased with increasing initial H2S concentration and increased slightly with gas residence time. \u03b7H2S was increased dramatically with relative humidity from<5% to 43% while the concentration of oxygen in gas environments affected the removal of H2S. The mechanisms for direct and indirect photolysis (generation of ozone) were illustrated by the experimental results on photolysis of H2S under argon environments and ozonation of H2S under air environments, respectively. The overall \u03b7H2S by photolysis is higher than the combination of \u03b7H2S by direct photolysis and ozonation, suggesting that hydroxyl radical-mediated indirect photolysis played an important role during photolysis processes. The main photolysis product was confirmed to be SO4(2-) with ion chromatograph."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
