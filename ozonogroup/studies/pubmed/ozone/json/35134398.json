In this paper, a platinum plate as anode, a method of electrochemical oxidation is adopted to modify graphite felt (GF) cathode to promote H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield and TOC removal from oxalic acid solution in EP process, its performance, mechanism and stability were discussed. Compared with original GF cathode, 2.6 times H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield can be achieved by the 5\u00a0min electrochemically modified GF (GF-5). The high electrochemical activity of the modified GF can be ascribed to introducing numerous surface oxygen-containing functional groups (OGs), which not only decreased the impedance, but also increased the amount of active site of O<sub>2</sub> reduction. The production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with GF-5 cathode improved with the increased initial pH, cathodic potential and O<sub>2</sub> flow rate, while this promoting effect was not observed in GF cathode. Compared with GF cathode, TOC removal rate was improved by 21.5% with GF-5 cathode due to higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yield in EP process. The primary pathway of TOC removal is electrochemically-driven peroxone process, and hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) is the dominant reactive species. Furthermore, GF-5 cathode had a good stability due to the protection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free electrons injected. The results indicate that the electrochemically modified GF severed as the cathode of EP processes has significant efficiency and stability in the removal of ozone-refractory organic contaminants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
