Due to the inefficient treatment technologies, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are unable to remove many antibiotics from wastewater. This review encapsulates the current status of antibiotics occurrence in influent and effluent of WWTPs globally. Specifically, \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines classes of antibiotics are found to be high in wastewater. An overview of physicochemical properties, generation classifications of antibiotics, and different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) available for the removal of emerging pollutants are presented. Besides, the removal efficiency of diverse antibiotics by various AOPs are discussed. The combination such as UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> and ozonation are reported for maximum removal of antibiotics. However, when compared to simulated wastewater, limitations are persisted for the removal of antibiotics in real wastewater, owing to its difficulty in assessing and observing the compound under mixed nature. AOPs assisted degradation mechanism for ciprofloxacin antibiotic in wastewater is presented and the necessity of research on antibiotic removal is highlighted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
