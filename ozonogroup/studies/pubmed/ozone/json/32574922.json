The occurrence of its degradates such as desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), imidacloprid-urea (IMI-urea), and desnitro-imidacloprid-olefin (DN-IMI-olefin) in environment water and their fate during drinking water treatment were seldom documented. In this study, IMI and its degradates were determined in source water (the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Hanshui River), treated water, and tap water (n\u00a0=\u00a020, 20, and 169, respectively) in different seasons of 2019 in Wuhan, central China. Their occurrence, removal efficiency, and seasonal variations were evaluated. Advanced water treatment with ozone combined with activated carbon might remove target analytes efficiently but conventional water treatment cannot. IMI and its degradates were 100% detectable in the conventionally treated water samples in July. IMI and DN-IMI decreased while IMI-urea, DN-IMI-olefin, imidacloprid-olefin (IMI-olefin), and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (5-OH-IMI) increased during conventional drinking water treatment. IMI and its degradates were found in the tap water samples treated conventionally (range: 1.17-32.0\u00a0ng/L for IMI; 0.57-7.00\u00a0ng/L for DN-IMI; 0.58-4.50\u00a0ng/L for IMI-urea; 0.04-0.65\u00a0ng/L for DN-IMI-olefin; < method detection limit [MDL]-0.80\u00a0ng/L for IMI-olefin; < MDL-0.35\u00a0ng/L for 5-OH-IMI). The concentrations of DN-IMI and IMI-urea observed in this study were higher than those observed in North America. Sodium sulfite did not increase the levels of DN-IMI and IMI-urea in tap water samples in the present study. This is the first study to demonstrate the occurrence of DN-IMI and IMI-urea in water in China and the occurrence of DN-IMI-olefin, IMI-olefin, and 5-OH-IMI in water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
