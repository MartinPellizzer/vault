A study was conducted to investigate whether antioxidation genotypes influence these associations.", "A follow-up study of 97 schoolchildren was conducted in New Taipei City, Taiwan. A structured respiratory health questionnaire was administered in September 2007, followed by monthly spirometry and measurement of nasal inflammation from October 2007 to November 2009. During the study period, complete daily monitoring data for air pollutants were obtained from the Environmental Protection Administration monitoring station and Aerosol Supersite. The genotypes of glutathione S-transferase (GST) subunits M1, T1, P1 and superoxide dismutases subunit 2 (SOD2) were characterized. Mixed-effects models were used, adjusting for known confounders.", "GSTM1 null children had significant PM2.5-related increment in leukocyte (8.52%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.13-13.92%) and neutrophil (9.68%; 95% CI: 4.51-14.85%) in nasal lavage. Ozone levels were significantly and inversely associated with forced expiratory flow at 25% of forced vital capacity (FEF25%) (-0.43L/s; 95% CI: -0.58,-0.28L/s) in SOD2 Ala16 variant children.", "In this longitudinal study of schoolchildren.

Antioxidation genotype also acts as an effect modifier, but not strong, in ozone-related small airway function response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
