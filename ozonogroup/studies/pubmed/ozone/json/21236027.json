Consumers no longer tolerate poisons in their food and water, are now concerned with global warming and ozone depletion, and value fields and forests for their scenery and wildlife as well as food and fibre. We are at the crossroads, searching for answers to these and many other pressing ecological problems. On one side sit 'deep ecologists' who patiently await the reactions of global Gaia. On the other sit 'biotechnologists' who would design and build new organisms and new ecosystems. The first approach is defeatist, for it awaits the decimation of the human population. The otheris activist, but will it work? Here we examine the idea of 'ecological engineering', which offers some promise of solutions to our problems if it can integrate the practical sides of ecosystem, landscape, community and population ecology with relevant formal concepts from the engineering sciences."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 1992.
