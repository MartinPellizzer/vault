Through the photochemical age method and the minimum R squared (MRS) method, we derived the summer urban formaldehyde release ratios of 3.37 ppbv (ppmv of CO)<sup>-1</sup> and 4.04 ppbv (ppmv of CO)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The error of both estimations is within \u00b120%, indicating the consistency of the results. We recognized the hourly minimum emission ratios determined from the MRS method to be indicative of actual formaldehyde emission ratios. Similarly, the emission ratio in winter is determined to be 2.10 ppbv (ppmv of CO)<sup>-1</sup> utilizing the MRS method. The findings provide significant insights into the potential impact of motor vehicle exhaust on formaldehyde emissions in urban areas. This work demonstrates that the formaldehyde emission ratio determined by the MRS method can be used to represent the emissions of the freshest air mass. Formaldehyde photolysis contributed an average of 9% to the free radical primary reaction rate (P(RO<sub><i>x</i></sub>)) as a single chemical species during the daytime in summer, which was lower than the 11% recorded in winter. Formaldehyde emission reduction positively impacts local ozone production, so models describing ozone formation in Shanghai during summer need to reflect these emissions accurately. Evidence of the crucial catalytic role of formaldehyde in particulate matter formation has been confirmed by recent research. A potentially effective way to decrease the incidence of haze days in autumn and winter in the future is therefore to focus on reducing formaldehyde emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Piesat Information Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing 100195, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuehui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao, Shandong 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Shengao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0655-3389"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongli", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9425-9520"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Ozone Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Keding", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao, Shandong 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Hengqing", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37844299", "10.1021/acs.est.3c06428"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
