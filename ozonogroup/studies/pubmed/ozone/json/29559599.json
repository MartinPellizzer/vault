The treatment sides were showered with ozonated water and smeared with ozonated oil for 7 days (twice a day), while the control sides were washed with warm running water and smeared with base oil. At different time points, the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) scores, sleep and pruritus scores were assessed and compared between the two sides. Meanwhile, plate cultivation was used to quantitatively detect the changes of S. aureus colonization in skin lesions.\u2029 Results: After 7 days treatment, erythema and pimples were decreased in the treatment sides. The clear skin texture, smooth skin, improved skin lesions were also observed by dermoscopic examination. The results of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) demonstrated that the parakeratosis was improved, the structures were clearer, and the inflammatory cells infiltration was reduced after ozone treatment for 7 days. After ozone treatment for 3 and 7 days, the S. aureus colonization in the treatment sides decreased by (75.55\u00b121.81)% and (97.24\u00b12.64)% respectively. Compared to that of control sides, the percentage of S. aureus colony after ozone treatment for 7 days decreased significantly (P<0.01). After ozone treatment for 7 days, the SCORAD scores, sleep and pruritus scores were significantly decreased (all P<0.01). There was a linear correlation between the decreasing percentage of S. aureus colony and the declining percentage of SCORAD scores in AD patients.\u2029 Conclusion: Topical ozone therapy can effectively reduce S. aureus colony in skin lesions and alleviate the severity of AD patients with moderate to severe degree."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jianyun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Miaomiao", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yizhi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Zhibing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Jianhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jinhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Yaping", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban", "NlmUniqueID": "101230586", "ISSNLinking": "1672-7347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dermoscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Skin Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29559599", "10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2018.02.009"]}}]}
