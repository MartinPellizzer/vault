It is therefore important to determine the aggregate exccedancc over 40 nL/L throughout the United Kingdom. Over most of the UK, ozone concentrations are unknown so we rely on our understanding of the atmospheric processes and on the statistical properties of ozone concentrations to interpolate between monitoring sites. This paper describes the application of statistical models derived for storm severity data to the ozone data for the United Kingdom. Aggregate excess distributions were fitted to data from all rural monitoring sites using a Weibull model with a 40 nL/L threshold. At this threshold the scale parameter has a spatial interpretation, but, with higher thresholds, there were problems with missing data and small scale spatial effects were not detected. The approach appears successful for all except very large aggregate exceedances which deviate from the Weibull predictions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute Terrestrial Ecology, Edinburgh Research Station, Bush Estate, Penicuik, Midlothian EH26 0QB, Scotland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Sheffield, School of Mathematics and Statistics, P.O.
