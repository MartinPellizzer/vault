Most epidemiological studies explore the relationship between ambient ozone and health effects based on fixed site monitoring data. Fine modeling of ground-level ozone exposure conducted by statistical models has great advantages for improving exposure accuracy and reducing exposure bias. However, there is no review summarizing such studies.", "A review is presented to summarize the basic process of model development and to provide some suggestions for researchers.", "A search of PubMed, Web of Science and the Wanfang Database was performed for dates through July 1, 2019 to obtain relevant studies worldwide. We also examined the references of the articles of interest to ensure that as many articles as possible were included.", "The land use regression model (LUR model), random forest model and artificial neural network model have been used in this field. We summarized these studies in terms of model selection, data preparation, simulation scale selection, and model establishment and validation. Multiparameters are a major feature of models. Parameters that influence the formation of ground-level ozone concentrations and parameters that have been extremely important in previous articles should be considered first. The process of model establishment and validation is essentially a process of continuously optimizing the model performance, but there are certain differences in the specific models.", "This review summarized the basic process of the statistical model for ambient ozone exposure. We gave the applicable conditions and application scope of different models and summarized the advantages and disadvantages of various models in ozone modeling research. In the future, research is still needed to explore this area based on its own research purposes and capabilities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
