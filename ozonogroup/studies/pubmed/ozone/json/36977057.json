A size exclusion chromatography system paired with absorbance, fluorescence, and total organic carbon detection was used to determine the fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6<sub>f</sub>) as a function of the apparent molecular weight (AMW). Size-based fractions of each isolate were collected and irradiated to measure singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) quantum yield (\u03a6<sub>1O2</sub>). \u03a6<sub>f</sub> decreased with ozonation in low AMW fractions, while increasing in high AMW fractions. \u03a6<sub>1O2</sub> increased with ozone dose in low AMW fractions from \u223c2 to \u223c7% and \u223c3 to \u223c11% for PLFA and SRFA, respectively, indicating that these are the most photoreactive fractions of DOM. Decreases in \u03a6<sub>f</sub> and concomitant increases in \u03a6<sub>1O2</sub> in low AMW fractions indicated that chemical transformations occurred, likely including the conversion of phenols to quinones, particularly in SRFA. Results further suggest that the photoactive and fluorescent fractions of DOM are likely independent pools of chromophores from different AMW fractions. In PLFA, a linear response in \u03a6<sub>1O2</sub>, specific UV absorbance at wavelength 254 nm (SUVA<sub>254</sub>), and \u03a6<sub>f</sub> with ozonation indicated the equal distribution of ozone-reactive moieties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3325-2530"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Buckley", "ForeName": "Shelby", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8400-3142"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Leresche", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Hanson", "ForeName": "Blair", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3311-9089"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Rosario-Ortiz", "ForeName": "Fernando L", "Initials": "FL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dissolved Organic Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dissolved Organic Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36977057", "10.1021/acs.est.2c08155"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
