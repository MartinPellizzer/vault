Furthermore, optical properties of BrC may change significantly during its atmospheric aging. We examined the effect of photolysis on the molecular composition, mass absorption coefficient, and fluorescence of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) prepared by high-NOx photooxidation of naphthalene (NAP SOA). Our experiments were designed to model photolysis processes of NAP SOA compounds dissolved in cloud or fog droplets. Aqueous solutions of NAP SOA were observed to photobleach (i.e., lose their ability to absorb visible radiation) with an effective half-life of \u223c15 h (with sun in its zenith) for the loss of near-UV (300-400 nm) absorbance. The molecular composition of NAP SOA was significantly modified by photolysis, with the average SOA formula changing from C14.1H14.5O5.1N0.085 to C11.8H14.9O4.5N0.023 after 4 h of irradiation. However, the average O/C ratio did not change significantly, suggesting that it is not a good metric for assessing the extent of photolysis-driven aging in NAP SOA (and in BrC in general). In contrast to NAP SOA, the photobleaching of BrC material produced by the reaction of limonene + ozone SOA with ammonia vapor (aged LIM/O3 SOA) was much faster, but it did not result in a significant change in average molecular composition. The characteristic absorbance of the aged LIM/O3 SOA in the 450-600 nm range decayed with an effective half-life of <0.5 h. These results emphasize the highly variable and dynamic nature of different types of atmospheric BrC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California , Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyun Ji Julie", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aiona", "ForeName": "Paige Kuuipo", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2166IN72UN", "NameOfSubstance": "naphthalene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laboratories"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25102050", "10.1021/es502515r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
