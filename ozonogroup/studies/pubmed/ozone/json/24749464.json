The principle, mechanism, and influence of experimental conditions on the degradation of pollutants in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation and the photocatalytic process were discussed. Introducing solid catalysts substantially increased the efficiency of the ozonation process by producing hydroxyl radicals in the degradation process. The different types of catalyst, catalyst dosage, solution pH, ozone flow rate, water matrix and catalytic reusability and stability are reported on here. The list of various semiconductor materials used as photocatalysts, their light absorption properties, various light sources and surface properties such as surface area, pore size and pore volume as a factor in the photocatalytic degradation of various pollutants are discussed. The review article also discussed the pollutants degraded using these three processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Muruganandham", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suri", "ForeName": "Rominder P S", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4", "ForeName": "Mika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jerry J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahmmad", "ForeName": "Bashir", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Balachandran", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Swaminathan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24749464", "10.1166/jnn.2014.8718"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
