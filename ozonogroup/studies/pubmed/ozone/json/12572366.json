And test its effectiveness. Designed apparatus must be rapid, low cost, high automatic and easy for operation. The key technologies are to create ozone of high concentration and to mix it with water very well, and add it into main water pipe automatically. The results showed: In laboratory, at the condition of ozone of 0.2 mg/l for 3 minutes, all germs and bacteria coli were killed. In the field study, the water samples from three villages met the standard for drinking water very well.", "The apparatus reached the design requirement. An innovative part of the study is that we have improved a device for mixture of ozone with water. The laboratory and field study have proved the apparatus is low cost, high effectiveness, and easy to operate u. It is very useful for small drinking water supply system in rural areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Beijing Municipal Commission for Patriotic Health Campaign, Beijing 100053, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xianli", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yumin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liyang", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Yan Jiu", "NlmUniqueID": "9426367", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12572366"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
