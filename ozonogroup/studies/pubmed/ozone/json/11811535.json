Incubation of neutrophils with alpha-tocopherol succinate (TS) resulted in a dose-dependent incorporation into cell membranes, up to 2.5 nmol/2x10(6) cells. A saturating dose of TS (40 micromol/l) inhibited oxidant production by neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan (OZ) by 86 and 57%, as measured by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (CL). With PMA, TS inhibited CL generation to a similar extent to staurosporine (10 nmol/l) or genistein (100 micromol/l), and much more than Trolox (40 micromol/l). With OZ, TS inhibited CL to a similar extent to Trolox. Neutrophil PKC activity was inhibited 50% or more by TS or staurosporine. The enzyme activity was unaffected by genistein or Trolox, indicating a specific interaction of alpha-tocopherol. TS or Trolox increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in resting neutrophils, and as with staurosporine further increased tyrosine phosphorylation in PMA-stimulated neutrophils, while the tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor genistein diminished phosphorylation. These effects in resting or PMA-stimulated neutrophils were unrelated to protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities, which were maintained or increased by TS or Trolox. In OZ-stimulated neutrophils, on the other hand, all four compounds inhibited the increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In this case, the effects of pre-incubation with TS or Trolox corresponded with partial inhibition of the marked (85%) decrease in PTP activity induced by OZ. These results indicate that alpha-tocopherol inhibits PMA-activation of human neutrophils by inhibition of PKC activity, and inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of OZ-stimulated neutrophils also through inhibition of phosphatase inactivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monteiro", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schindler", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stern", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Junqueira", "ForeName": "V B", "Initials": "VB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21820-51-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphotyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H4N855PNZ1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Tocopherol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S18UL9710X", "NameOfSubstance": "6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chromans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphotyrosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Tocopherol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11811535", "10.1080/10715760100301341"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
