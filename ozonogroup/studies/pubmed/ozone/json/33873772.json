However, the etiology of O<sub>3</sub> toxicity remains unclear. Activated oxygen species appear to inflict biochemical lesions and propagate defense responses that compound plant injury. Because some plant defense responses involve membrane-delimited GTPases (G proteins), we evaluated the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity of Arabidopsis mutants altered in the heterotrimeric G-protein pathway. \u2022\u2002 Eight genotypes were treated with a range of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (0, 100, 175 and 250\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> ) for 13\u00a0d in controlled environment chambers. \u2022\u2002 After treatment with O<sub>3</sub> , the epinasty typically observed for wild type leaves did not occur in mutant plants lacking the alpha subunit of the G-protein complex (gpa1). O<sub>3</sub> -induced suppression of leaf chlorophyll levels and leaf mass per unit leaf area were less for gpa1 mutants and were not due to differences in O<sub>3</sub> flux. \u2022\u2002 There was a positive correlation between the lack of a G-protein alpha subunit and decreased O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity. Our results suggest that a heterotrimeric G-protein is critically involved in the expression of O<sub>3</sub> effects in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality - Plant Growth and Development Unit, and Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, 3908 Inwood Road, Raleigh, NC 26703 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "Fitzgerald L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality - Plant Growth and Development Unit, and Department of Crop Science, North Carolina State University, 3908 Inwood Road, Raleigh, NC 26703 USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burkey", "ForeName": "Kent O", "Initials": "KO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Overmyer", "ForeName": "Kirk", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Alan M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Aharon GS, Gelli A, Snedden WA, Blumwald E. 1998.
