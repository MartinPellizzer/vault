An accurate understanding of O<sub>3</sub> pollution evolution is critical for making effective regulatory policies. Here we integrate data- and process-based models to explore the drivers of the observed summertime surface O<sub>3</sub> change in the North China Plain (NCP) over 2015-2021. The data-based model by the deep learning (DL) suggests the reverse of meteorological contributions to the observed O<sub>3</sub> change, i.e., 0.14\u00a0ppb/y in 2015-2019 and\u00a0-1.74\u00a0ppb/y in 2019-2021. This is mainly resulted from the reversed changes in meteorological variables in surface air temperature and relative humidity. The simulations from a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, also support those results, i.e., the meteorological contribution to O<sub>3</sub> changes are 0.26\u00a0ppb/y in 2015-2019 and\u00a0-0.74\u00a0ppb/y in 2019-2021. Furthermore, our analysis exhibits possible weakened anthropogenic contributions to surface O<sub>3</sub> rise, for example, 1.53 and 0.54\u00a0ppb/y by DL in 2015-2019 and 2019-2021, respectively. Similarly, GEOS-Chem simulations suggest an accelerated decrease in surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations driven by the decline in nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, i.e., approximately 0.4 and 1.2\u00a0ppb in 2015-2019 and 2019-2021, respectively. The combined effects of meteorological and anthropogenic contributions led to a significant decrease in surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by -1.20\u00a0ppb/y in 2019-2021. The findings in this work offer valuable insights to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
