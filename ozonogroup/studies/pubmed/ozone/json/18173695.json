The ground laying work of Margaret Kripke in the 1970s provided a fitting explanation: UV-induced immunosuppression and tolerance toward the UV-induced tumors. From Kripke's work a new discipline arose: \"Photoimmunology.\" Enormous strides were made in exploring and expanding the effects from UV carcinogenesis to infectious diseases, and in elucidating the mechanisms involved. Stemming from concerns about a depletion of the ozone layer and the general impact of ambient UV radiation, the groups I worked in and closely collaborated with explored the anticipated adverse effects of UV-induced immunosuppression on healthy individuals. An important turning point was brought about in 1992 when the group of Kevin Cooper reported that immunosuppression could be induced by UV exposure in virtually all human subjects tested, suggesting that this is a normal and sound physiological reaction to UV exposure. This reaction could actually protect us from illicit immune responses against our UV-exposed skin, such as observed in idiopathic polymorphic light eruption. This premise has fruitfully rekindled the research on this common \"sun allergy,\" affecting to widely varying degrees about one in five Europeans with indoor professions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. f.r.de_gruijl@lumc.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Gruijl", "ForeName": "Frank R", "Initials": "FR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immune Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppression Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "97"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18173695", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00211.x", "PHP211"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
