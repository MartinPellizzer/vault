In this study, three pharmaceuticals were selected as model compounds for degradation experiments: diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ). Comparison of the degradation rates for both ozonation and combined ultrasound/ozonation treatments was performed on single synthetic solutions as well as on a mixture of the selected pharmaceuticals, under different experimental conditions. For single synthetic solutions, the efficiency removal for ozonation reached 73%, 51% and 59% after 40\u2005min for DCF, SMX and CBZ, respectively. Comparable results were obtained for pharmaceuticals in mixture. However, the combined ultrasound/ozone treatment was found to increase degradation efficiencies for both DCF and SMX single solutions up to 94% and 61%, respectively, whereas lower removal yields, up to 56%, was noted for CBZ. Likewise, when the combined treatment was applied to the mixture, relatively low removal efficiencies was found for CBZ (44%) and 90% degradation yield was achieved for DCF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Sanitary Environmental Engineering Division, Department of Civil Engineering , University of Salerno , Via Giovanni Paolo II, 84084 Fisciano , SA , Italy."}], "LastName": "Naddeo", "ForeName": "Vincenzo", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uyguner-Demirel", "ForeName": "Ceyda Senem", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prado", "ForeName": "Moriel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cesaro", "ForeName": "Alessandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Belgiorno", "ForeName": "Vincenzo", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ballesteros", "ForeName": "Florencio", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Energy Shock Waves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sonication"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25655135", "10.1080/09593330.2015.1014864"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
