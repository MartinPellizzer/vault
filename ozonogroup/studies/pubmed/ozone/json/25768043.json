Here we report laboratory studies of the kinetics and products of the reaction between CH3O2 and BrO radicals that shows that this could be an important new source of hydroxyl radicals:BrO + CH3O2 \u2192 products (1). The temperature dependent value in Arrhenius form of k(T) is k1 = (2.42\u20130.72+1.02) \u00d7 10\u201314\u202fexp[(1617 \u00b1 94)/T] cm3 molecule\u20131 s\u20131. In addition, CH2OO and HOBr are believed to be the major products. Global model results suggest that the decomposition of H2COO to form OH could lead to an enhancement in OH of up to 20% in mid-latitudes in the upper troposphere and in the lower stratosphere enhancements in OH of 2\u20139% are inferred from model integrations. In addition, reaction 1 aids conversion of BrO to HOBr and slows polar ozone loss in the lower stratosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS, U.K."}], "LastName": "Shallcross", "ForeName": "Dudley E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester, Williamson Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K."}], "LastName": "Leather", "ForeName": "Kimberley E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester, Williamson Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K."}], "LastName": "Bacak", "ForeName": "Asan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS, U.K."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2225Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Edmond P F", "Initials": "EP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2225Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "Maggie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2225Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Mok", "ForeName": "Daniel K W", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, U.K."}], "LastName": "Dyke", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u22a5School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}], "LastName": "Hossaini", "ForeName": "Ryan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u22a5School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, U.K."}], "LastName": "Chipperfield", "ForeName": "Martyn P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS, U.K."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "M Anwar H", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, The University of Manchester, Williamson Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K."}], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25768043", "10.1021/jp5108203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
