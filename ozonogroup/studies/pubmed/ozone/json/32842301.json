They were fed in air pollutant exposure system and clean experimental environment respectively, and the concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in each system were measured. The degree of olfaction damage of SD rats at different feeding time was assessed by using the buried food test (BFT). The difference of BFT time between the two groups was analyzed by performing the repeated measures analysis of variance. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that the concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the exposure group were (22.65\u00b111.47) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and (12.36\u00b15.87) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, while those in the control group were both 0 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. The repeated measures analysis of variance showed that the time of BFT in the exposure group was longer than that in the control group (<i>F</i>=6.49, <i>P</i>=0.031). With the increase of feeding time, the time of BFT was prolonged (<i>F</i>=61.69, <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the atmosphere might lead to olfaction damage in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University of School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Friendship Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University of School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University of School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health and the Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Peking University of School of Public Health, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "91643111, 91743114", "Agency": "National Natural science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smell"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32842301", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200508-00699"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
