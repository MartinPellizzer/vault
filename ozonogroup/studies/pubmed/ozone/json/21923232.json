This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ozone therapy (OT), as an immunomodulator and antioxidant, on the renal function, morphology and biochemical parameters of oxidative stress in an experimental model of APN in rats.", "Forty rats were divided equally into five groups as control, APN, APN + Antibiotic, APN + OT, and APN + Antibiotic + OT. APN was induced by 0.1 ml of freshly prepared Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) solution containing 10(10) colony-forming unit/ml into the kidney. A control group was administered 0.1 ml of 0.9 % NaCl solution. Treatment was begun 72 h after bacterial inoculation. Control and APN groups were given 0.9% NaCl solution, APN + Antibiotic and APN + OT were given either antibiotic (ciprofloxacine 150 mg/kg intramuscular/twice daily) or OT. APN + Antibiotic + OT group was given both antibiotic and OT for five consecutive days. At the end of the seventh day, animals were killed via decapitation and trunk blood was collected. Both kidneys were harvested and one half of each kidney were immediately stored for antioxidant enzyme activity, tissue lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content. The remainder was fixed for histopathologic examination.", "E. coli-induced APN increased the renal glomerular and tubular dysfunction, oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzyme activities. Either antibiotherapy or OT markedly ameliorated renal dysfunction, the antioxidant status of the kidneys and histopathological injuries subjected to E. coli-induced APN. Interestingly, the combination of antibiotherapy and OT was much more effective than either of the treatment modalities alone.", "The combination of antibiotherapy and OT markedly ameliorated renal dysfunction and improved antioxidant status and histopathologic modalities in rats subjected to E. coli-induced APN than either antibiotherapy or OT treatment alone. Therefore, OT may be considered as an adjuvant therapy to classical antibiotherapy to prevent renal inflammation and fibrosis in APN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Gulhane Military Medical Faculty, Etlik, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caliskan", "ForeName": "Bahadir", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guven", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozler", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cayci", "ForeName": "Tuncer", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozcan", "ForeName": "Ayhan", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bedir", "ForeName": "Orhan", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Surer", "ForeName": "Ilhami", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korkmaz", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Clin Lab Invest", "NlmUniqueID": "0404375", "ISSNLinking": "0036-5513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5E8K9I0O4U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "670-65-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Neopterin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-12-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcitonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MU72812GK0", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Calcitonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Neopterin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pyelonephritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21923232", "10.3109/00365513.2011.587022"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
