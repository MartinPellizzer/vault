Importantly, VBNC bacteria could resuscitate under favorable conditions leading to significant public health concerns. Although the total number of viable bacteria has been theorized to be far greater than those that can be cultured, there have been no reports quantifying VBNC pathogenic bacteria in full-scale drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). In this work, we used both culture-dependent and quantitative PCR combination with propidium monoazide (PMA) dye approaches to characterize cellular viability. Further, we established a method to quantify viable pathogens by relating specific gene copies to viable cell numbers. Ratios of culturable bacteria to viable 16S rRNA gene copies in water and biological activated carbon (BAC) biofilms were 0-4.75% and 0.04-56.24%, respectively. The VBNC E. coli, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Shigella sp. were detected at levels of 0-10<sup>3</sup> cells/100\u202fmL in source water, 0-10<sup>2</sup> cells/100\u202fmL in chlorinated water, and 0-10<sup>3</sup> cells/g in BAC biofilms. In addition, differences between the total and viable community structures after ozonation and chlorination were investigated. The relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium, Sphingomonas, etc. increased in final water, likely due to their chlorine resistance. In summary, we detected significant quantities of viable/VBNC opportunistic pathogens in full-scale DWTPs, confirming that traditional, culture-dependent methods are inadequate for detecting VBNC bacteria. These findings suggest a need to develop and implement rapid, accurate methods for the detection of VBNC pathogenic bacteria in DWTPs to ensure the safety of drinking water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
