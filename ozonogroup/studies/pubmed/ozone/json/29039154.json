Pneumocephalus can result from inadvertent dural puncture during lumbar epidural anesthesia or epidural steroid injection. Presently described is case of 41-year-old woman who had undergone lumbar disc hernia operation but due to ongoing complaints, was diagnosed as having failed back surgery syndrome. Percutaneous epidural neuroplasty was performed. In the operating room, under sterile conditions and under sedoanalgesia, Racz catheter was inserted in caudal area and guided to epidural area with scope. In accordance with Madrid Declaration, 20 ug/mL concentration and 5 mL volume oxygen-ozone mixture was injected. After waiting 5 minutes, 0.25% bupivacaine + 80 mg triamcinolone + 1500 units hyaluronidase was administered through the catheter. After epidural neuroplasty procedure, when patient was taken to gurney, she complained of severe headache and nausea. Computed tomography scans of head were done immediately, and consistent with pneumocephalus, air was observed in right lateral ventricle frontal horn, interhemispheric fissure, and superior cerebellar cistern. Patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and intravenous fluid was replaced. Analgesics and bed rest were recommended as treatment. Patient was discharged from hospital on the second day. Within a week, headache pain and other complaints had resolved. In this article, the case of a failed back surgery patient who was postoperatively treated with medical ozone and experienced complication of pneumocephalus is discussed in context of literature data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, \u00c7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University Faculty of Medicine, \u00c7anakkale, Turkey. huseyintoman01@hotmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toman", "ForeName": "H\u00fcseyin", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u00d6zdemir", "ForeName": "U\u011fur", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiraz", "ForeName": "Hasan Ali", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fcleci", "ForeName": "Nurettin", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Agri", "NlmUniqueID": "9426197", "ISSNLinking": "1300-0012"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diagnosis, Differential"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Failed Back Surgery Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Headache"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnostic imaging"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumocephalus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29039154", "10.5505/agri.2016.36024"]}}]}
