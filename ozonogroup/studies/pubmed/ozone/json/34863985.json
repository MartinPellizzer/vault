Although the largest sources of BVOCs are tropical regions, the measurements of isoprene in the Indian subcontinent are limited. We conducted the measurements of isoprene, benzene, and toluene at an urban site in a hillocky megacity of India using a high-sensitivity proton transfer reaction quadrupole mass spectrometer (PTR-QMS). The mixing ratios of isoprene were compared with those of aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene, which represent typical anthropogenic VOCs. Isoprene and isoprene/benzene (>5\u00a0ppbv\u00a0ppbv<sup>-1</sup>) showed higher levels in the pre-monsoon months, most likely due to large emissions by urban vegetation during physiological activities in plants which was enhanced by the high ambient temperatures and solar radiation. While Benzene and toluene showed higher mixing ratios during winter, which were due to shallower boundary layer depths and transport of air masses from polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain during this season. The mixing ratios of VOCs show significant diurnal variation as a result of their different origins and the role of different meteorological parameters. The robust emission ratios of isoprene/benzene obtained from nighttime data were used to separate the non-anthropogenic and anthropogenic isoprene emissions. \u223c30% enhancement observed in non-anthropogenic emissions to isoprene from winter to pre-monsoon season when temperatures and solar radiation were stronger, although traffic in the city. Isoprene/benzene ratio at lower temperatures (<25\u00a0\u00b0C) and solar radiation (<100\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>) was predominantly controlled by anthropogenic sources. Overall, toluene and isoprene are the most frequent species in terms of having the highest ozone-forming potential (OFP) values but biogenic isoprene became more important to ozone formation during the afternoon hours in the pre-monsoon months with high air temperatures (>25\u00a0\u00b0C)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
