This work utilized a silver-ion solid phase extraction (SPE) approach to separate individual NA species into 20 fractions before subsequent ozone treatment. The ozonation reactivity of aromatic and oxidized NA species in isolated fractions was studied for the first time. Untreated and ozone-treated SPE fractions were characterized using ultra performance liquid chromatography ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The removals of aliphatic O<sub>2</sub>-NAs (Fraction 3), aromatic O<sub>2</sub>-NAs (Fraction 8), O<sub>3</sub>-NAs (Fraction 11), and O<sub>4</sub>-NAs (Fraction 17) with an applied ozone dosage of 16.8\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> were 97.2%, 94.7%, 59.4% and 44.7%, respectively. The results showed that aromatic and oxidized NAs with larger carbon number were favorably removed during ozonation treatment. Comparison of the ozone utilization efficiency for different NA species indicated that the degradation of oxidized NAs consumed more ozone in molar ratio than the degradation of classical and aromatic NAs. The reactivity of oxidized NAs was lower than that of classical NAs because the former consumed more ozone in molar ratio during reactions. Knowing the reactivity of different NA species is crucial for the design of ozonation systems targeting species with high toxicity. Moreover, the utilization of silver-ion SPE pre-separation approach has been demonstrated for future studies investigating the degradation mechanism of distinct NA species under other treatment conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
