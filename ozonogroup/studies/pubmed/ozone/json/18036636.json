Chloro- and bromo-containing halocarbons are responsible for the stratospheric ozone depletion and will be globally banned from usage within the next years. With the exception of the stable CFC-12 (CF2 Cl2), all major CFCs and chlorinated solvents show a negative trend in recent years in their background concentrations at Jungfraujoch. HCFCs, as their first-generation substitute, are still increasing with a few percent per year. However, the frequency and the strength of HCFCs pollution events, which are caused by regional European emissions, are already declining. This can be seen as a sign of the impending ban of these gases within the next years in Europe. On the other hand, HFCs as the second-generation substitutes, are increasing with relative rates of at least 10% per year (e.g. almost 5 ppt per year for HFC-134a). An allocation of European sources was attempted by combining measured concentrations with trajectories of air masses reaching the Jungfraujoch during pollution events. Potential source regions could be detected in Italy, France, Spain and Germany."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Empa, Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology, Ueberlandstrasse 129, CH-8600 Duebendorf, Switzerland. stefan.reimann@empa.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reimann", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vollmer", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folini", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steinbacher", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hill", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buchmann", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zander", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahieu", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18036636", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.10.022", "S0048-9697(07)01082-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
