Meanwhile, as for the common phenomenon of membrane fouling, uneven distribution of multiphase solid catalysts and ozone in liquids, the addition of ultrasound can not only disperse materials, but also play a role in online cleaning of ceramic membranes and catalysts. The optimum treatment conditions for Rhodamine B (RhB) solution with volume of 2 L and concentration of 40\u00a0mg/L were catalyst concentration of 0.4\u00a0mg/L, reaction temperature of 45\u00a0\u00b0C, ultrasonic time of 1\u00a0h, ultrasonic intensity of 600\u00a0W, removal rate of RhB was up to 90\u00a0%. In addition, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation method was used to investigate the fluid flow between the two gas-liquid phases and the effect of the negative pressure of the membrane pump on the fluid by the analysis of flow, pressure and ozone flux of the ceramic membrane(CM) reaction apparatus. The CFD simulation results showed that at the inlet gas-liquid flow rate of 3\u00a0m/s and the negative pressure of 20,000\u00a0Pa, the maximum flow rates of CM-1 were 3\u00a0m/s, 0.752\u00a0m/s for CM-2, and 0.228\u00a0m/s for CM-3, respectively. Vortices, which are beneficial to solid-liquid mixing and gas-liquid mass transfer, formed between the suction port CM-1 of CM-1 and the inlets of CM-2 and CM-3. This discovery is consistent with relevant experimental research results. Significantly higher concentrations of both \u2022OH and dissolved ozone were observed in the US/HM-RM/O<sub>3</sub> system compared to other systems, indicating the significant improvement in ozone utilization rate through the application of ultrasound. The superiority of the US/HM-RM/O<sub>3</sub> device was demonstrated. The real dye effluent was tested under optimum operating conditions and the results showed that COD and TOC were reduced by 81.34\u00a0% and 60.23\u00a0% respectively after 180\u00a0min of treatment. The above research can provide technical support for the treatment of dye wastewater using Ultrasound-enhanced ozone oxidation ceramic membranes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
