The pathways through which stomata perceive ROS share many common linkages with the well characterized signalling pathway for the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), a major driver of stomatal closure. Given reports that ABA receptor mutants have no stomatal response to ozone-triggered ROS production, as well as evidence that all steps in the ABA biosynthetic pathway can be non-enzymatically converted by ROS, here we investigated the possibility that ozone closes stomata by directly converting ABA precursors to ABA. In plants where stomata were responsive to ozone, we found that foliar ABA levels rapidly increased upon exposure to ozone. Recovery of gas exchange post-exposure occurred only when ABA levels declined. Our data suggest that stomatal closure in response to ozone exposure occurs as a result of direct oxidation of ABA precursors leading to ABA production, but the importance of this ROS interaction remains uncertain under normal photosynthetic conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tasmania, 7001, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McAdam", "ForeName": "Erin L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tasmania, 7001, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brodribb", "ForeName": "Timothy J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tasmania, 7001, Australia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9625-6750"], "LastName": "McAdam", "ForeName": "Scott A M", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steam"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "72S9A8J5GW", "NameOfSubstance": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Steam"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28042679", "10.1111/pce.12893"]}}]}
