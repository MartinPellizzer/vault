We estimated the anthropogenic VOC emission inventory in China in 2018 and established a source profile database containing 129 sources based on localized detection and the latest research results. Then, the distribution of the ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) for emission sources was analyzed. Moreover, priority control routes for VOC emission sources were proposed for different periods. Anthropogenic VOC emissions in China reached 27,211.8 Gg in 2018, and small passenger cars, industrial protective coatings, biomass burning, heavy trucks, printing, asphalt paving, oil storage and transportation, coking, and oil refining were the main contributors. Industrial protective coatings, small passenger cars, and biomass burning all contributed significantly to OFP and SOAFP. Priority in emission reduction control should be given to industrial protective coatings, small passenger cars, heavy trucks, coking, printing, asphalt paving, chemical fibers, and basic organic chemical sources over the medium and long term in China. In addition, the priority control route for VOC emission sources should be adjusted according to the variations in VOC emission characteristics and regional differences, so as to obtain the maximum environmental benefits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
