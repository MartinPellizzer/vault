The ozone formation potential (OFP) and aerosol formation potential (AFP) of VOCs were also estimated using the max incremental reactivity (MIR) and aerosol formation coefficient (FAC) methods, respectively. The results showed that the average concentration of VOCs was 41.66 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the proportions of alkanes, olefins, aromatics, and acetylene were 48.50%, 14.08%, 15.37%, and 22.05%, respectively. The top ten species of VOCs were primarily C2-C5 alkanes, also including acetylene, ethylene, and some aromatics, accounting for 69.25% of the total VOCs. VOCs showed obvious diurnal variation characteristics with a high concentration in the morning and evening (at 06:00 and 22:00) and a low concentration in the afternoon (11:00-16:00). According to the value of toluene/benzene (T/B) and isopentane/n-pentane, the atmosphere of the industrial area was mainly affected by vehicle exhaust emissions, solvent use, combustion sources, and LPG/NG. The total AFP of VOCs was up to 41.43\u00d710<sup>-2</sup> \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and aromatics were the largest contributor. The total OFP of VOCs reached 117.59 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, in which the alkenes contributed the most."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center of Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110013, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Cong-Cong", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of High Technology for Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xing-Na", "Initials": "XN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37438277", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202206182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
