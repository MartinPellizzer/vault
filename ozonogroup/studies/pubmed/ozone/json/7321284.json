The welders between 20 and 29 years of age were selected as subjects and classified into five groups according to ozone concentrations of the workshops. Results of pulmonary function tests were analyzed with reference to working experiences, dust concentrations of the workshops, smoking habits and air pollution levels of the location of factories. An attempt were made to evaluate the possible effects of prolonged exposure to ozone produced by welding upon the health or workers. The results obtained were as follows. 1. Values of both peak flow rate and maximum expiratory flow rate at 75% of vital capacity (V75) were decreased slightly in welder groups, but relationships between the observed values and ozone concentrations were not recognized. 2. Values of maximum expiratory flow rate at 25% of vital capacity (V25) of welders who had been exposed to ozone in concentration of 1.05 ppm or more were decreased significantly compared with groups exposed to ozone under 1.05 ppm. 3. In addition, values of both V25 and forced vital capacity (FVC) of the workers who had been engaged in welding for 4 years or more were significantly lower than those of the workers for less than 4 years of exposure. However, the relationship between the lung function values and smoking habits were not significant in both groups. 4. The decreases in V25 values were observed in several workers who had been exposed even to 0.46 ppm or higher (but under 1.05 ppm) ozone concentrations. 5. Relationships between the lung function values and either smoking habits or air pollutant levels of locations were not significant in all groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohmori", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tozawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikemi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitazume", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Sangyo Igaku", "NlmUniqueID": "0150531", "ISSNLinking": "0047-1879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Flow Rates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximal Expiratory Flow-Volume Curves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7321284", "10.1539/joh1959.23.394"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
