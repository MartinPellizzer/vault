This action was implemented to cut down all unnecessary human activities, including industry, agriculture and transportation. Reducing these activities to a very low level during these hard times meant that some unprecedented naturally occurring measures of controlling emissions were executed. Ironically, however, after these measures were implemented, ozone levels increased by 43.9%. Also worthy of note, PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased 31.7%, which was found by comparing the observation data in Wuhan during the epidemic from 8th Feb. to 8th Apr. in 2020 with the same periods in 2019. Utilizing CMAQ (The Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system), this article investigated the reason for these phenomena based on four sets of numerical simulations with different schemes of emission reduction. Comparing the four sets of simulations with observation, it was deduced that the emissions should decrease to approximately 20% from the typical industrial output, and 10% from agriculture and transportation sources, attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan. More importantly, through the CMAQ process analysis, this study quantitatively analyzed differences of the physical and chemical processes that were affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. It then examined the differences of the COVID-19 lockdown impact and determined the physical and chemical processes between when the pollution increased and decreased, determining the most affected period of the day. As a result, this paper found that (1) PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased mainly due to the reduction of emission and the contrary contribution of aerosol processes. The North-East wind was also in favor of the decreasing of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. (2) O<sub>3</sub> increased mainly due to the slowing down of chemical consumption processes, which made the concentration change of O<sub>3</sub> pollution higher at about 4 p.m.-7 p.m. of the day, while increasing the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> at night during the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan. The higher O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the North-East of the main urban area also contributed to the increasing of O<sub>3</sub> with unfavorable wind direction."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
