Novel direct-inlet mass spectrometry (DI-MS) has been widely applied for real-time monitoring of VOCs. To verify its applicability in industrial settings, high mass-resolution proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight MS (HMR-PTR-TOFMS), single-photon ionization time-of-flight MS (SPI-TOFMS), together with online GC-FID/MS were simultaneously deployed at the boundary of one of the largest chemical industrial parks in eastern China. Aromatics, acetonitrile, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, aliphatic hydrocarbons, 1,2-dichloroethane, and acetone were detected as the main pollutants. These three instruments detected 12 common species, among which ethyl acetate, toluene, C8-aromatics, and methyl ethyl ketone showed similar time series and levels. Acetone, benzene, chlorobenzene, styrene, and C9-aromatics showed only similar time series. The HMR-PTR-TOFMS uniquely detected 14 species, mainly oxidized VOCs, nitriles, and amines, which greatly helps acknowledge the pollutants in the chemical industrial area. Positive matrix factorization, using the HMR-PTR-TOFMS and GC-FID/MS datasets, was used to identify eight sources. Four of the identified sources were mainly detected by the HMR-PTR-TOFMS, with pollutants mainly comprised of nitriles, amines, carbonyls, and organic acids, most of which were hazardous and/or odorous. These four sources accounted for 41.5% and 33.2% of the total VOCs and ozone formation potential, respectively. The complementary nature of GC-FID/MS and HMR-PTR-TOFMS in VOC source apportionment in industrial settings is of great practical use for advanced VOCs abatement. Thus, the high mass resolution DI-MSs are suggested to be a supplementary measurement for fence-line monitoring. Although with a relatively short period attempt, this study has wide implications for the fence-line stationary observational modes and source apportion methods combining with traditional observations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
