However, their performance in predicting the maximum daily 8-h averaged ozone (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>), the metric often used for O<sub>3</sub> pollution assessment and management, is relatively poorer. This is largely resulted from more irregular data fluctuations of the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> levels governed collectively by the synoptic condition, local photochemistry, and long-range transport. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>, this study developed a secondary decomposition ML model framework which coupled the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) as the primary decomposition, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) as secondary decomposition, and the gate recurrent unit (GRU) ML model. By applying this secondary decomposition model framework on MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> prediction for the first time, we showed that the prediction accuracy of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> is largely improved from R<sup>2</sup> of 0.46 and RMSE of 30.4\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for GRU without decomposition to R<sup>2</sup> of 0.91 and RMSE of 12.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> over the Pearl River Delta of China. We also found that the prediction accuracy rate of O<sub>3</sub> pollution non-attainments, an essential indicator for initiating contingency O<sub>3</sub> pollution control, improved greatly from 14.9\u00a0% for GRU without decomposition to 72.5\u00a0%. The performance of O<sub>3</sub> pollution non-attainment prediction is relatively higher in southwestern PRD, which is mainly due to greater number and severity of O<sub>3</sub> non-attainments in southwestern cities located downwind of the emission hotspot area at central PRD. This study underscored the importance of secondary decomposition in accurately predicting daily-scale O<sub>3</sub> concentration and non-attainments over the PRD, which can be extended to other photochemically active region worldwide to improve their O<sub>3</sub> prediction accuracy and assist in O<sub>3</sub> contingency control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
