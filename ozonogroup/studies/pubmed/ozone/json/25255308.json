In this study a bioactive coating formulation based on modified chitosan containing 0.05% nanoemulsion of mandarin essential oil was tested in combination with \u03b3-irradiation, UV-C and ozonated water treatments, and the results in terms of antimicrobial activity, color and texture changes, were evaluated during 14 days storage. The combined coating and \u03b3-irradiation treatment gave promising results, showing 3.3 log CFU/g initial microbial reduction, and exhibiting a strong synergistic antimicrobial effect. The treatment based on UV-C and coating formulation allowed a 3 log CFU/g reduction of initial L. innocua population on samples, showing a good residual antimicrobial activity and preventing loss of firmness and color changes during storage. The combined treatment of coating and ozonated water did not show any synergistic or additive antimicrobial effect, but they showed an impact on firmness and color. In conclusion UV-C and \u03b3-irradiation treatments, in combination with the bioactive coating, represent an effective approach to control the growth of L. innocua on vegetable foods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
