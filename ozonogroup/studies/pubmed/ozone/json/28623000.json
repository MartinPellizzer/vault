Different drugs have been used in the clinical practice, however, there is not a completely effective treatment. Due to its potential therapeutic action, medical ozone represents a promising approach for neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of the present study was to address the role of ozone therapy on the cellular redox state in MS patients. Ozone (20\u03bcg/ml) was administered three times per week during a month by rectal insufflation. The effect of ozone therapy on biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation was addressed by spectrophotometric and immunoenzymatic assays. Furthermore, we investigated the action of ozone on CK2 expression and Nrf2 phosphorylation by western blotting analysis. Medical ozone significantly improved (P < 0.05) the activity of antioxidant enzymes and increased the levels of cellular reduced glutathione. In accordance, a significant reduction (P < 0.05) of oxidative damage on lipids and proteins was observed in ozone-treated patients. As well, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were lower after ozone treatment. Ozone therapy incremented the CK2 expression together with Nrf2 phosphorylation in mononuclear cells of MS patients. These findings suggest that ozone\u00b4s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects might be partially associated with an induction of Nrf2 phosphorylation and activation. These results provide new insights on the molecular events modulated by ozone, and pointed out ozone therapy as a potential therapeutic alternative for MS patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
