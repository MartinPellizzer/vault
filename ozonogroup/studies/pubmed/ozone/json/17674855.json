This research focused on the integrated treatment of the wastewater of the paper industry, with a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and an oxidation step. The optimal configuration was examined. Screening tests with different types of oxidation showed that ozonation after biological treatment could reduce the COD with 40% with an ozone dose of 0.4-0.8g O3/g COD. BOD/COD ratio could be increased up to 0.19. Neither combination of ozone with UV and/or hydrogen peroxide nor the process H2O2/UV or (photo-)Fenton reagents gave any improvement in COD reduction or BOD increase, unless the doses were very high. Based on these results, an integrated system MBR-ozonation was designed, with recirculation of MBR effluent over ozonation. This test showed that reduction of COD up to 125 mg/L immediately behind the MBR required a lot of ozone. A technically feasible solution was to discharge the water after an extra ozonation step, which resulted in a high total ozone dosage. The alternative, the consecutive treatment activated sludge-ozonation-activated sludge, did not give a better COD-removal with the same ozone dose as the integrated concept. The economic evaluation proves that the integrated chemical and biological treatment is expensive for the paper industry if a low discharge limit of COD has to be complied with."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "VITO (Flemish Institute for Technological Research), Environmental and Process Technology, Mol, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gommers", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Wever", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brauns", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peys", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17674855", "10.2166/wst.2007.410"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
