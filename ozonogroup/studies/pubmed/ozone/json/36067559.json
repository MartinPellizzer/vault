In this contribution, to overcome the efficiency-resistance trade-off for fibrous filtration, we introduced an electrostatic polydopamine-interface-mediated (e-PIM) filter utilizing a combined effect of particle pre-charging and filter polarizing. After delineating the PM-fiber interactions in electrostatic filtration, we designed a composite fiber structure and fabricated the filters by a two-step dip-coating. The surface topography and electrical potential of the polyester (PET) coarse substrates were regulated by successively coating polydopamine (PDA) layers and manganese oxide clusters. By this means, an 8-mm-thick Mn-P\u00a0@\u00a0P-100 filter possessed improved efficiency of 96.05%, 97.60%, and 99.14% for 0.3-0.5\u00a0\u00b5m, 0.5-1\u00a0\u00b5m, and 1-3\u00a0\u00b5m particles, the ultralow air resistance of 10.4\u00a0Pa at a filtration velocity of 0.5\u00a0m/s, and steady ozone removal property. Compared with the pristine PET substrates, the efficiency for 0.3-0.5\u00a0\u00b5m particles expanded 12 times. Compared with the pristine PET substrates, the efficiency for 0.3-0.5\u00a0\u00b5m particles expanded 12 times. We expect e-PIM filters and the filtration prototype will be potential candidates as effective and low-cost air cleaning devices for a sustainable and healthy environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
