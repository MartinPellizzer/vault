The UV absorption spectrum of the oxidized undecylenic acid film is significantly red-shifted compared to that of the initial film. Photolysis of the oxidized film in the tropospheric actinic region (lambda > 295 nm) readily produces formaldehyde and formic acid as gas-phase products. Photodissociation action spectra of the oxidized film suggest that organic peroxides are responsible for the observed photochemical activity. The presence of peroxides is confirmed by mass-spectrometric analysis of the oxidized sample and an iodometric test. Significant polymerization resulting from secondary reactions of Criegee radicals during ozonolysis of the film is observed. The data strongly imply the importance of photochemistry in aging of atmospheric organic aerosol particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-2025, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomez", "ForeName": "Anthony L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jiho", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walser", "ForeName": "Maggie L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ao", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16526639", "10.1021/jp0554442"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
