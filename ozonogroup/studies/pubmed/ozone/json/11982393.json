The C(6)-C(2)-C(6) framework of suitably protected derivatives of 1, 2, and 3 has been degraded with ozone to the C(6)-C(1) aldehydes 4, 5, 9, and 10, retaining all hydrogen atoms of the precursors. The natural and synthetic derivatives are characterized and distinguished by natural abundance deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance studies. In the case of anisaldehyde 4 the two series show, as expected, the characteristic difference of the aromatic labeling. The formyl deuterium contents of 4 and 5 from resveratrol are remarkably different, seemingly reflecting the different enrichments existing between positions 3 and 2, respectively, of the phenylpropanoid precursor. The positional delta(18)O values of the extractive materials 1-3 were also determined. In this instance a selective deoxygenation procedure was adopted, leading from 1 to the products 6, 7, and 8. The delta(18)O values of the latter compounds reveal, respectively, those at position 4' and positions 3 and 5 of 1. Similarly, the phenolic products 11 and 12 were converted into 13 and 14. From the delta(18)O values of the single components it is possible to design a detailed map of the oxygen fractionations which characterizes the stilbenes 1-3. In particular, the oxygen present at position 4' of the phenylpropanoid moiety of 1-3 shows delta(18)O values of +11.5, +1.8, and +6.7 per thousand, respectively. Moreover, the phenolic oxygen atom at position 3' of rhapontin 3 shows a value of +11.7 per thousand. The data are compared with those previously obtained on structurally related compounds. These results show the utility of simple chemical degradations in the stable isotope characterization of structurally complex food components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica del Politecnico and CNR, Centro di Studio sulle Sostanze Organiche Naturali, Via Mancinelli 7, 20131 Milano, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fronza", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuganti", "ForeName": "Claudio", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Serra", "ForeName": "Stefano", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cisero", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koziet", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AR09D82C7G", "NameOfSubstance": "Deuterium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Deuterium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isotope Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11982393", "10.1021/jf011103j", "jf011103j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
