The forecasting system operated on two separate domains centered on Chicago, IL, and New York City, NY, and provided 72-hour predictions of atmospheric composition, aerosols, and clouds. This study evaluates the Chicago-centered forecasting system's 1-, 2-, and 3-day ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) forecast skill for Chiwaukee Prairie, WI, a rural area downwind of Chicago that often experiences high levels of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Comparisons to vertical O<sub>3</sub> profiles collected by a Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) instrument revealed that forecast skill decreases as forecast lead time increases. When compared to surface measurements, the forecasting system tended to underestimate O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on high O<sub>3</sub> days and overestimate on low O<sub>3</sub> days at Chiwaukee Prairie regardless of forecast lead time. Using July 25, 2023, as a case study, analyses show that the forecasts underestimated peak O<sub>3</sub> levels at Chiwaukee Prairie during this regionwide bad air quality day. Wind speed and direction data indicates that this underestimation can partially be attributed to lake breeze simulation errors. Surface fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) measurements, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and back trajectories from the NOAA Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model show that transported Canadian wildfire smoke impacted the Lake Michigan region on this day. Errors in the forecasted chemical composition and transport of the smoke plumes also contributed to underpredictions of O<sub>3</sub> levels at Chiwaukee Prairie on July 25, 2023. The results of this work help identify improvements that can be made for future iterations of the WRF-Chem forecasting system.<i>Implications</i>: Air quality forecasting is an important tool that can be used to inform the public about upcoming high pollution days so that individuals may plan accordingly to limit their exposure to health-damaging air pollutants. Forecasting also helps scientists make decisions about where to make observations during air quality field campaigns. A variety of observational datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of an air quality forecasting system that was developed for NOAA and NASA field campaigns that occurred in the summer of 2023. These evaluations inform areas of improvement for future development of this air quality forecasting system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4192-4333"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}], "LastName": "Acdan", "ForeName": "Juanito Jerrold Mariano", "Initials": "JJM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space Science and Engineering Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}], "LastName": "Pierce", "ForeName": "R Bradley", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Earth Science, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Now at Iowa Technology Institute, College of Engineering, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Earth Science, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA."}], "LastName": "McKinney", "ForeName": "Todd", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Earth Science, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA."}], "LastName": "Stevenson", "ForeName": "Darby", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Earth Science, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA."}], "LastName": "Newchurch", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Chemistry Observations & Modeling Laboratory, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "LastName": "Pfister", "ForeName": "Gabriele", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Earth Sciences, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Siqi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Earth Sciences, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39008376", "10.1080/10962247.2024.2380333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
