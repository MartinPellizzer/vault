The dependency of extent of degradation on the operating parameters like temperature (over the range of 30-36\u00b0C), initial pH (3-9), catalyst as ZnO (loading of 0.025-0.15g/L) and CuO (loading of 0.02-0.1g/L) and initial concentration of 2,4-DCP (20-50ppm) has been established to maximize the efficacy of ultrasound (US) induced degradation. Using only US, the maximum degradation of 2,4-DCP obtained was 28.85% under optimized conditions of initial concentration as 20ppm, pH of 5 and temperature of 34\u00b0C. Study of effect of ozone flow rate for approach of only ozone revealed that maximum degradation was obtained at 400mg/h ozone flow rate. The combined approaches such as US+O<sub>3</sub>, US+ZnO, US+CuO, O<sub>3</sub>+ZnO, O<sub>3</sub>+CuO, US+O<sub>3</sub>+ZnO and US+O<sub>3</sub>+CuO have been subsequently investigated under optimized conditions and observed to be more efficient as compared to individual approaches. The maximum extent of degradation for the combined operation of US+O<sub>3</sub> (400mg/h)+ZnO (0.1g/L) and US+O<sub>3</sub> (400mg/h)+CuO (0.08g/L) has been obtained as 95.66% and 97.03% respectively. The degradation products of 2,4-DCP have been identified using GC-MS analysis and the toxicity analysis has also been performed based on the anti-microbial activity test (agar-well diffusion method) for the different treatment strategies. The present work has conclusively established that the combined approach of US+O<sub>3</sub>+CuO was the most efficient treatment scheme resulting in near complete degradation of 2,4-DCP with production of less toxic intermediates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
