Advanced oxidation process involves production of hydrogen radicals, which are the strongest oxidant. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced oxidation process by combining gaseous ozone and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide. Grape tomatoes were inoculated with a 2-strain cocktail of Salmonella typhimurium on both stem scar and smooth surface. Gaseous ozone (800 and 1600\u202fppm) and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (2.5, 5 and 10%) were separately or simultaneously introduced into a treatment chamber where the inoculated tomatoes were placed. During the 30\u202fmin treatments, hydrogen peroxide was aerosolized using an atomizer operated in two modes: continuously or 15\u202fs on/50\u202fs off. After the treatments, surviving Salmonella on the smooth surface and stem scar were enumerated. Results showed that ozone alone reduced Salmonella populations by <0.6 log CFU/fruit on both the smooth surface and the stem scar area, and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide alone reduced the populations by up to 2.1 log CFU/fruit on the smooth surface and 0.8 log CFU/fruit on stem scar area. However, the combination treatments reduced the populations by up to 5.2 log CFU/fruit on smooth surface and 4.2 log CFU/fruit on the stem scar. Overall, our results demonstrate that gaseous ozone and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide have synergistic effects on the reduction of Salmonella populations on tomatoes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, 4Agricultural Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center, 600 E.
