The results indicated that after the sludge was exposed to ozone at less than 0.02 g O(3)/g TSS, the DGGE fingerprint remained constant and there was still some enzyme activity, indicating that the sludge solubilization was the main process. At greater than 0.02 g O(3)/g TSS, the bacteria began to be broken down and ozone was used to oxidize the bio-macromolecules such as proteins and DNA released from the sludge. Bacteria belonging to 'G-Bacteria' were able to conserve their DNA in the presence of less than 0.08 g O(3)/g TSS. At levels higher than 0.10 g O(3)/g TSS, the disintegration of the sludge matrix became slow and the microbes lost most of their activity, and ozone was used to transform the bio-macromolecules into small molecules. However, at levels higher than 0.14 g O(3)/g TSS, the ozone failed to oxidize the sludge efficiently, because several radical scavengers such as lactic acid and SO(4)(2-) were released from the microbial cells in the sludge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Sang-Tian", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Li-Bing", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Xin-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "An-Feng", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xu-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurcik", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18976790", "10.1016/j.watres.2008.09.039", "S0043-1354(08)00448-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
