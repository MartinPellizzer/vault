We combined an acute 8-h ozone inhalation with vagal perineural capsaicin treatment, a selective C-fiber conduction block, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling as an index of epithelial injury. Vehicle-treated rats that inhaled ozone developed a rapid shallow breathing pattern during ozone inhalation, whereas the capsaicin-treated rats that inhaled ozone showed no changes in respiratory frequency. In vehicle-treated, ozone-exposed rats that developed rapid shallow breathing, a progressive increase in BrdU-labeling density (no. of BrdU-labeled cells/mm(2) airway) was observed starting at the bifurcation of the left main stem bronchi (central airway) and going down either a short or long airway path. In vehicle-treated, ozone-exposed rats, terminal bronchioles supplied by short and long airway paths had a similar degree of BrdU-labeling density that was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than the BrdU-labeling density of the proximal airways that supply them. In contrast, the attenuation of rapid shallow breathing produced by capsaicin treatment resulted in a significantly reduced BrdU-labeling density in the terminal bronchioles supplied by short airway paths compared with the terminal bronchioles supplied by long airway paths. Our data indicate that ozone-induced rapid shallow breathing protects large conducting airways while producing a more even distribution of injury to terminal bronchioles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Cell Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, One Shields Road, Davis, CA 95616, USA. esschelegle@ucdavis.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alfaro", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Putney", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stovall", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyler", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES-06791", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimetabolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G34N38R2N1", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromodeoxyuridine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antimetabolites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromodeoxyuridine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Fibers"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11568142", "10.1152/jappl.2001.91.4.1611"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
