Air-water interface happens to be an important reaction site pertaining to such phenomena. However, except iodide (I<sup>-</sup>), the behavior of other iodine species, for example, triiodide (I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and iodate (IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the most abundant iodine species in seawater) at the aqueous interface and their effect on the interfacial water are largely unknown. Using interface-specific vibrational spectroscopy (heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation), we recorded the imaginary-\u03c7<sup>(2)</sup> spectra (Im\u03c7<sup>(2)</sup>; \u03c7<sup>(2)</sup> is the second-order electric susceptibility in OH stretch region) of the air-water interface in the presence of IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and I<sup>-</sup> (\u22640.3 M) in the aqueous subphase. The Im\u03c7<sup>(2)</sup> spectra reveal that the chaotropic I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is the most surface-active anion among the iodine species studied and decreases the vibrational coupling and hydrogen-bonding of interfacial water. Interestingly, the IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, even being a kosmotrope, is quite prevalent in the interfacial region and preferentially orients the interfacial water as \"H-down\" (i.e., water dipole moment is pointed toward the bulk water). Mapping of the OH stretch response of ion-affected water at interface (i.e., \u0394Im\u03c7<sup>(2)</sup> = Im\u03c7<sup>(2)</sup><sub>air-water-iodine\u00a0salt</sub> - Im\u03c7<sup>(2)</sup><sub>air-water</sub>) with that in the hydration shell of the respective ion (hydration shell water response is obtained by Raman multivariate curve resolution spectroscopy) reveals a correlative link between the ion's influence on the interfacial water and their hydration shell structure. The distinct water structure of stronger as well as weaker H-bonding in the hydration shell of the polyatomic IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> anion promotes the anion to stay at the interfacial region. Thus, the surface prevalence of the iodine species and their effect on the interfacial water are perceived to be crucial for the transfer of iodine from seawater to the atmosphere across the marine boundary layer and the chemistry of iodine at aqueous aerosol surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation & Photochemistry Division , Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute , Trombay, Mumbai 400085 , India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saha", "ForeName": "Subhamoy", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation & Photochemistry Division , Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute , Trombay, Mumbai 400085 , India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Subhadip", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation & Photochemistry Division , Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute , Trombay, Mumbai 400085 , India."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0860-686X"], "LastName": "Mathi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation & Photochemistry Division , Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute , Trombay, Mumbai 400085 , India."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6536-787X"], "LastName": "Mondal", "ForeName": "Jahur A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30830779", "10.1021/acs.jpca.9b00828"]}}]}
