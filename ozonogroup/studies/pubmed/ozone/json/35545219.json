To date, the association between carbon monoxide (CO) and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has not been examined.", "Among 134,478 dialysis patients in the Korean ESRD cohort between 2001 and 2014, 8,130 deceased hemodialysis patients were enrolled, and data were analyzed using bidirectional, unidirectional, and time-stratified case-crossover design. We examined the association between short-term CO concentration and mortality in patients with ESRD. We used a two-pollutant model, adjusted for temperature as a climate factor and for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter less than 10 \u03bcm in diameter as air pollution variables other than CO.", "Characteristics of the study population included age (66.2 \u00b1 12.1 years), sex (male, 59.1%; female, 40.9%), and comorbidities (diabetes, 55.6%; hypertension, 14.4%). Concentration of CO was significantly associated with all-cause mortality in the three case-crossover designs using the two-pollutant model adjusted for SO2. Patients with diabetes or age older than 75 years had a higher risk of mortality than patients without diabetes or those younger than 75 years.", "Findings presented here suggest that higher CO concentration is correlated with increased all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients, especially in older high-risk patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Huh", "ForeName": "Hyuk", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Health and Environment, Graduate School of Public Health Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ejin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Una Amelia", "Initials": "UA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Mun Jeong", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Administration and Management, College of Medical Sciences, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyewon", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Soie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Life and Death Studies, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Clara Tammy", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong Ki", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kidney Research Institute, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Science, Seoul National University Graduate School, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yon Su", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Chun Soo", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jung Pyo", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Health and Environment, Graduate School of Public Health Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ho", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yong Chul", "Initials": "YC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "4199990514025", "Agency": "Seoul National University", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Korean Society of Nephrology", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Kidney Res Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101586778", "ISSNLinking": "2211-9132"}, "CoiStatement": "\n<b>Conflicts of interest</b>\n.
