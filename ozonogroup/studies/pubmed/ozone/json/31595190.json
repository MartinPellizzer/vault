Volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations were measured immediately downwind of prescribed tallgrass prairie fires in the Flint Hills region of Kansas, United States. The VOC mixture is dominated by alkenes and oxygenated VOCs, which are highly reactive and can drive photochemical production of ozone downwind of the fires. The computed emission factors are comparable to those previous measured from pasture maintenance fires in Brazil. In addition to the emission of large amounts of particulate matter, hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and acrolein are emitted in significant amounts and could contribute to adverse health effects in exposed populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5996-8217"], "LastName": "Whitehill", "ForeName": "Andrew R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "Ingrid", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Russell", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "Kirk R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8742-496X"], "LastName": "Landis", "ForeName": "Matthew", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Atmosphere (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101562250", "ISSNLinking": "2073-4433"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
