In recent decades, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has increased dramatically as an important agricultural soil N input, while its effect on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the current and future climate change remains unknown. Here, we conducted a thorough analysis of the effect of N deposition and climate change on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions as well as their trends. Soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions induced by N deposition accounted for 25% of global cropland soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Global soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions over croplands increased by 2% yr<sup>-1</sup> during 1996-2013, of which N deposition could explain 15% of the increase. The emission factor of N deposition was \u223c7 times that of N fertilizer plus manure (\u223c1%) through a more direct way, since N deposition including nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) could be directly used for nitrification and denitrification. By 2100, N deposition will increase by 80% and cropland soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions will increase by 241% under the RCP8.5 scenario in comparison with the 2010 baseline. These results suggest that, under the background of increasing global N deposition, it is essential to consider its effects on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in climatic change studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuyu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2889-8900"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, Institute of Arid Agroecology, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute for Earth System Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiuying", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8367-5833"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, National Academy of Agriculture Green Development, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xuejun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute for Earth System Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yaowen", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33734680", "10.1021/acs.est.0c08004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
