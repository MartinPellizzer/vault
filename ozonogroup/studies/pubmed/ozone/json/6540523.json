The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response of the tracheal epithelium to cytotoxic injury in a primate species that may have an epithelium more representative of that in man than smaller laboratory species. This study evaluated changes in the light-microscopic, surface, and ultrastructural appearance of the tracheobronchial epithelium of bonnet monkeys exposed for 3 or 7 days to 0.64 ppm ozone. Population densities, epithelial volumetric densities, and thymidine labeling indexes were determined for cells from posterior membranous and anterior cartilaginous trachea and mainstem bronchus. Ozone-induced epithelial changes were characterized by decreased numbers of ciliated cells, loss of cilia, and necrosis of ciliated cells. There were alterations in mucous (goblet) cell granules. There was an increase in extracellular space and focal epithelial stratification that was associated with increased numbers of small mucous granule cells and the presence of an epithelial cell type not seen in control animals (intermediate cells). There was an increase in cytoplasmic filaments and desmosomal attachments in basal cells, small mucous granule cells, and intermediate cells. Regional differences in lesion distribution were demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Longitudinal streaks of ciliary loss were evident in posterior membranous trachea, but ciliary loss in the ventral trachea was most prominent over the posterior border of the cartilaginous rings. The thymidine labeling index and numbers of necrotic ciliated cells were greater after 3 days than after 7 days of continuous exposure. Foci of stratification were often associated with increased numbers of labeled nuclei in the suprabasal region of the epithelium. The results of this study suggest that small mucous granule cells and intermediate cells are important participants in the repair of chemically injured airway epithelium; stratification and increased amounts of cytoplasmic filament bundles and desmosomal attachments, rather than being evidence of squamous metaplasia or dysplastic change, might be stereotypic responses of airway epithelium to injury; and the ciliated cell population becomes less susceptible to ozone-induced necrosis with continuing exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dungworth", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370502", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9440"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cilia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoskeleton"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Desmosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca radiata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Exp Cell Res. 1968 May;50(2):377-82", "ArticleIdList": ["4871034"]}, {"Citation": "Exp Mol Pathol. 1968 Dec;9(3):380-99", "ArticleIdList": ["4952084"]}, {"Citation": "Cell Tissue Kinet. 1970 Apr;3(2):185-206", "ArticleIdList": ["5523049"]}, {"Citation": "Lab Invest. 1973 Jul;29(1):41-53", "ArticleIdList": ["4728356"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med. 1974 Apr;145(4):1139-44", "ArticleIdList": ["4133300"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1974 Aug;110(2):157-69", "ArticleIdList": ["4369752"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1974 Nov;29(5):282-9", "ArticleIdList": ["4422936"]}, {"Citation": "J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975 Aug;55(2):353-69", "ArticleIdList": ["1159822"]}, {"Citation": "J Anat. 1975 Nov;120(Pt 2):295-320", "ArticleIdList": ["1201964"]}, {"Citation": "Lab Invest. 1976 Jun;34(6):565-78", "ArticleIdList": ["933466"]}, {"Citation": "Lab Invest. 1977 Jan;36(1):82-90", "ArticleIdList": ["401528"]}, {"Citation": "Exp Mol Pathol. 1977 Jun;26(3):384-400", "ArticleIdList": ["405246"]}, {"Citation": "Aviat Space Environ Med. 1977 Sep;48(9):812-8", "ArticleIdList": ["907591"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1977 Oct;116(4):695-703", "ArticleIdList": ["921053"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1977 Oct;116(4):705-77", "ArticleIdList": ["921054"]}, {"Citation": "Lab Invest. 1978 Jun;38(6):648-53", "ArticleIdList": ["661220"]}, {"Citation": "J Natl Cancer Inst. 1978 Aug;61(2):539-49", "ArticleIdList": ["355649"]}, {"Citation": "J Natl Cancer Inst. 1978 Aug;61(2):577-86", "ArticleIdList": ["355652"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Pathol. 1980 Jan;98(1):61-82", "ArticleIdList": ["6766047"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Pathol. 1980 Mar;98(3):811-40", "ArticleIdList": ["6767409"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1980 Jul;122(1):123-43", "ArticleIdList": ["7406333"]}, {"Citation": "Pathol Res Pract. 1980;168(1-3):134-45", "ArticleIdList": ["7433251"]}, {"Citation": "Exp Lung Res. 1983 Apr;4(3):205-26", "ArticleIdList": ["6851959"]}, {"Citation": "Exp Lung Res. 1983 Apr;4(3):227-43", "ArticleIdList": ["6552208"]}, {"Citation": "Exp Lung Res. 1983 Sep;5(2):79-98", "ArticleIdList": ["6628348"]}, {"Citation": "Cancer Res. 1971 Dec;31(12):1977-89", "ArticleIdList": ["5120295"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6540523", "PMC1900542"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
