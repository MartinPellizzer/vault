For copper, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms of the copper oxide reduction process and subsequent passivation layer formation reactions. We have investigated the in situ cleaning (i.e., oxidation and reduction by vapor-phase species) and passivation of chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)-prepared Cu films in an effort to derive the mechanisms associated with selectively tailoring the surface chemistry. By monitoring the interaction of vapor-phase ethanol with the surface species generated after ozone cleaning at 300 \u00b0C, we find that the optimum procedure to remove these species and avoid byproduct redeposition is to use atomic layer deposition (ALD)-like binary cycles of ethanol and N<sub>2</sub>, with active pumping. We have further explored passivation of clean Cu using benzotriazole and 2,2'-bipyridine in an ALD environment. Both molecules chemisorb on clean Cu in an upright orientation, with respect to the metal surface at temperatures higher than the melting point of the organic inhibitors (100 \u2264 T < 300 \u00b0C). Both molecules desorb without decomposition from clean Cu above 300 \u00b0C but not from Cu<sub>2</sub>O. Previous studies related to the passivation of Cu surfaces using heterocyclic amines have focused on solution-based or ultrahigh vacuum applications of the passivation molecules onto single crystalline Cu samples. The present work explores more industrially relevant vapor-phase passivation of CMP-cleaned, electroplated Cu samples using ALD-like processing conditions and in situ vapor-phase cleaning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science & Engineering , The University of Texas at Dallas , Richardson , Texas 75080 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6021-4703"], "LastName": "Pe\u00f1a", "ForeName": "Luis Fabi\u00e1n", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science & Engineering , The University of Texas at Dallas , Richardson , Texas 75080 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veyan", "ForeName": "Jean-Francois", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Versum Materials, Inc. , 8555 South River Parkway , Tempe , Arizona 85284 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Todd", "ForeName": "Michael A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Versum Materials, Inc. , 8555 South River Parkway , Tempe , Arizona 85284 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derecskei-Kovacs", "ForeName": "Agnes", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science & Engineering , The University of Texas at Dallas , Richardson , Texas 75080 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6435-0347"], "LastName": "Chabal", "ForeName": "Yves J", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30335353", "10.1021/acsami.8b13438"]}}]}
