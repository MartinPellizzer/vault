Ozonation of OSPW attenuates this toxicity. Altered concentrations of sex steroid hormones, impaired reproductive performance, and less prominent secondary sexual characteristics have been reported for fish exposed to OSPW. However, the mechanism(s) by which these effects occur and whether ozonation can attenuate these effects in fish was unknown. The objective of this in vivo study was to investigate the endocrine-disrupting effects of OSPW and ozone-treated OSPW on the abundances of transcripts of genes in the brain-gonad-liver (BGL) axis in male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Abundances of transcripts of genes important for synthesis of gonadotropins were greater in brains from both male and female fish exposed to untreated OSPW compared to that of control fish. In gonads from male fish exposed to untreated OSPW the abundances of transcripts of gonadotropin receptors and several enzymes of sex hormone steroidogenesis were greater than in control fish. The abundances of transcripts of estrogen-responsive genes were greater in livers from male fish exposed to untreated OSPW than in control fish. In female fish exposed to untreated OSPW there was less abundance of transcripts of gonadotropin receptors in gonads, as well as less abundance of transcripts of estrogen-responsive genes in livers. Many effects were either fully or partially attenuated in fish exposed to ozone-treated OSPW. The results indicate that (1) OSPW has endocrine-disrupting effects at all levels of BGL axis, (2) OSPW has different effects in male and female fish, (3) ozonation attenuates the effects of OSPW on abundances of transcripts of some genes, and the attenuation is more prominent in males than in females, but effects of ozonation on endocrine-disrupting effects of OSPW were less clear than in previous in vitro studies. The results provide a mechanistic basis for the endocrine-disrupting effects of OSPW from other studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Centre, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yuhe", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wiseman", "ForeName": "Steve B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perez-Estrada", "ForeName": "Leonidas A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El-Din", "ForeName": "Mohamed Gamal", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "Jonathan W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giesy", "ForeName": "John P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gonadotropins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cyprinidae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gonadotropins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gonads"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22856545", "10.1021/es3019258"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
