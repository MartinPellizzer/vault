The chemical processes leading to weakened haze mitigation are still poorly understood. Our work identifies the enhanced aging chemistries of black carbon (BC) with increasing O<sub>3</sub> as an essential driver to weaken haze mitigation based on field observations during autumn/winter haze periods in 2014 and 2018 in North China Plain. The enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity induced by increasing O<sub>3</sub> promotes the initial aging of accumulated fresh BC from continuous emission under haze pollution conditions and consequently improves the hygroscopicity of BC-containing particles to provide more particulate surfaces and volumes for aqueous and heterogeneous chemistries. The enhanced BC aging amplifies PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations by \u223c20%, which can be broken by concurrent reductions in multipollutant emissions (i.e., BC, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds), especially from residential and industrial sources. Moreover, enhanced BC aging implies an adverse effect of O<sub>3</sub> increase on climate change. Observationally enhanced BC aging will help to constrain estimations of the interactions among O<sub>3</sub> increase, haze pollution, and climate warming in recent years in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4362-6532"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Atmospheric and Earth System Sciences, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuxuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Nana", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Atmospheric and Earth System Sciences, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Aijun", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35674816", "10.1021/acs.est.2c00090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
