When this technology was applied for treating municipal wastewater, the results showed that even at maximum organic load (i.e. 7 kg COD m(-3) d(-1)), the COD in the treated effluent was lower than 50 mg L(-1). In addition, both ammonia and TKN removal efficiencies resulted in higher than 87% up to an organic load of 5.7 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) corresponding to a nitrogen load of 0.8 kg TKN m(-3) d(-1). Very satisfactory process performances also resulted during tannery wastewater treatment, when a chemical oxidation step (i.e. ozonation) was inserted in the treatment cycle of SUPERBIO. In such an instance, at organic and nitrogen loadings of 3 kgCOD m(-3) d(-1) and 0.20 kg N m(-3) d(-1), COD, NH4+ -N and TSS average removals were 96, 99 and 98%, respectively. Finally, during the whole experimentation, SUPERBIO was always characterised by a very low sludge production. Such a result was ascribed mainly to the characteristics of biomass that grew in the form of very dense granules (i.e. 130 gVSS L(Biomass)(-1) allowing a biomass concentration as high as 50-60 gTSS l(bed)(-1) to be achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque C.N.R., Via Reno 1, 00198 Roma, Italy. ramadori@irsa.rm.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramadori", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di Iaconi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lopez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Passino", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16889269", "10.2166/wst.2006.437"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
