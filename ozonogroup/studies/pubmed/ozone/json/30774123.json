Stable 3-NT is a specific marker for oxidative damage and is reported to have a promotive effect to elicit allergies. In the present study, we report the development of a highly sensitive assay to quantify 3-NT in air sampler filters to collect < 2.5 \u00b5m of particulate matter (PM2.5) from urban environmental air, including bio-aerosol. In this method, a 6 mm-diameter round hole was cut from the filters of air samplers and mixed with a nonspecific protease cocktail in order to hydrolyze proteins. Protein samples digested to the amino acid level were tested for 3-NT using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD). The maximum 3-NT content was detected in a prefilter for PM of sizes from 4.5 to 7.3 \u03bcm, with a detection limit of 1.13 pg/m<sup>3</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences; tataito@okayama-u.ac.jp."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Tatsuo", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogino", "ForeName": "Keiki", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagaoka", "ForeName": "Kenjiro", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishiyama", "ForeName": "Rina", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology-Periodontal Science, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimizu", "ForeName": "Yurika", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3604-79-3", "NameOfSubstance": "3-nitrotyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30774123", "10.3791/58371"]}}]}
