The effects of ozone stress on amylose content and RVA profile of rice grains located at different positions of panicles were studied by using a sunlit gas fumigation platform. Eight varieties representing different types of rice were fumigated under ambient (9 nL\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) or elevated ozone (100 nL\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) concentrations from transplanting until maturity. The results showed that elevated ozone treatment significantly reduced amylose content, maximum viscosity, hot viscosity, breakdown and cold viscosity by 5.9%, 7.6%, 5.9%, 11.6%, 2.9%, respectively, but increased the setback and gelatinization temperature by 24.9% and 1.0%. There were significant differences among varieties for amylose content and all parameters in RVA profile. The grains located at different positions on a panicle differed in amylose content, maximum viscosity, hot viscosity, breakdown and cold viscosity. The superior grains located at the upper part of a panicle had the highest value and the inferior grains located at the lower part of a panicle had the lowest value. However, the setback in RVA profile showed a different trend, with the superior grains having the lowest setback but inferior grains having the highest setback. In most cases, there were significant interactive effects of ozone by year or ozone by variety on amylose content and RVA profile. No significant ozone by grain position interaction on RVA profile was found, although the responses of superior grains to ozone stress was slightly smaller than those of inferior grains or grains located at the middle part of a panicle. The results demonstrated that ozone fumigation of 100 nL\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> during rice growing season deteriorated rice quality, with the magnitude of deterioration varying with growth seasons and varieties and little impacts of grain positions on a panicle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan-Liu", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Hai-Rong", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Zai-Sheng", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-Xia", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Li-Quan", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Long", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology/Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lian-Xin", "Initials": "LX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "\u81ed\u6c27\u80c1\u8feb\u5bf9\u7a3b\u7a57\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u4f4d\u7cd9\u7c73\u76f4\u94fe\u6dc0\u7c89\u542b\u91cf\u548cRVA\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-82-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amylose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31840467", "10.13287/j.1001-9332.201912.028"]}}]}
