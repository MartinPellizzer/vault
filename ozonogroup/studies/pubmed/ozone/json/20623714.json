Peptides, drugs and metabolites in the mass range of 150-2500 Da were readily analyzed. The best performance was obtained with 500 nm thick films deposited at a deposition angle of 85 degrees . Low background mass spectra and attomole detection limits were observed with DIOS-MS for various peptides. Films used after three months of dry storage in ambient conditions produced mass spectra with negligible low-mass noise following a 15 min UV-ozone treatment. The performance of the Si GLAD films was as good as or better than that reported for electrochemically etched porous silicon and related materials, and was superior to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS for analysis of mixtures of small molecules between 150-2500 Da in terms of background chemical noise, detection limits and spot-to-spot reproducibility. The spot-to-spot reproducibility of signal intensities (100 shots/spectrum) from 21 different Si GLAD film targets was +/-13% relative standard deviation (RSD). The single shot-to-shot reproducibility of signals on a single target was +/-19% RSD (n = 7), with no indication of sweet spots or mute spots."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Nanotechnology, National Research Council Canada, Edmonton, AB, Canada, T6G 2M9."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jemere", "ForeName": "Abebaw B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bezuidenhout", "ForeName": "Louis W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brett", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "D Jed", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20623714", "10.1002/rcm.4634"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
