Lungs were studied from mice that had been immunized with aerosolized ovalbumin as well as from normal mice and from mice that were exposed to ozone (0.5 or 0.8 ppm) prior to receiving aerosolized antigen. In addition, some mice were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin precipitated in alum. IgE-containing cells were primarily airway-related in normal mice and in mice immunized by the intraperitoneal route. Lungs from aerosol-immunized, and aerosol-immunized ozone-exposed mice showed a more disseminated distribution of IgE-containing cells. Fluorescent cells were counted and numbers were expressed as total cells per square millimeter of lung tissue and as airway-associated cells per millimeter of airway. Total IgE cells increased 9.4-fold in mice that received aerosolized ovalbumin as compared to normal mice. When ozone exposure was added to the effects from aerosolized ovalbumin, the increase of IgE cells over normal was 34.2-fold. IgE cell counts correlated well with anaphylactic sensitivity to intravenous challenge with ovalbumin. The observed enhancement of allergic sensitization by ozone exposure has important implications for human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gershwin", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osebold", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zee", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5501RR5457", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM 762", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404561", "ISSNLinking": "0020-5915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Intranasal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Anaphylaxis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody-Producing Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7195381", "10.1159/000232766"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
