The highly organized stratum corneum forming the main barrier against most xenobiotics is particularly susceptible to such damage and possible barrier perturbation may be the consequence. Whereas ample evidence exists for an increased permeability for different solutes including water after exposure to ultraviolet radiation, such an effect has not yet been reported for ozone. This study reports on the effect of such oxidative stressors using the hairless mouse as the skin model and measuring temperature-controlled transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator for skin barrier integrity. First, a strong dependency of the TEWL on skin temperature was observed, an effect that was clearly more pronounced than that found in man. Given this temperature dependency in untreated animals, we proceeded to determine the effects of both ultraviolet radiation and ozone on TEWL over a relevant physiological skin temperature range. Solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation (0.75-3 minimal erythemal dose) resulted in a delayed and dose-dependent skin barrier disruption over the entire temperature range investigated. Conversely, daily ozone exposure at 2 ppm for 1 week, however, did not significantly alter TEWL up to 72 h after the last exposure. The results demonstrate a differential response of the epidermis to two environmental stressors associated with oxidative damage; they suggest that chronic ozone exposure at relevant environmental levels does not lead to a detectable skin barrier defect, while solar UV exposure was demonstrated to increase epidermal water loss. Furthermore, experimental evidence clearly suggests that future studies applying TEWL measurements in animal models should be performed under carefully controlled skin temperature conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 S.
