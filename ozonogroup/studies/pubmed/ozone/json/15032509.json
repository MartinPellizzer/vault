The monitoring site was located in the City of Buenos Aires in a relatively heavy traffic crossroad of two avenues. The data required special pretreatment where the hourly content of rain, wind intensity, wind velocity, and cloudiness were concerned. The new variable named insolation factor (relative UV radiation) calculated on the basis of the general meteorological data, the geographic position of the monitoring site, cloudiness, date, and the time of the recording was composed. The relative intensity of UV radiation was modeled by a Gaussian function, multiplied by a cloudiness factor. Based on the 14-variable input and the 1-variable output (ozone) data, first, the clustering of all 980 data records was made. The top map clustering showing the ozone concentration was related to the maps of all 14 variables. The link between O3 clusters, NO2, and Isfi weight levels is shown and discussed. As a preliminary result of this study some of the most interesting correlations between the maps and remaining variables are given."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Chemistry, Hajdrihova 19, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia. neva.groselj@ki.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Groselj", "ForeName": "Neva", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zupan", "ForeName": "Jure", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reich", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dawidowski", "ForeName": "Laura", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gomez", "ForeName": "Dar\u00edo", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magallanes", "ForeName": "Jorge", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Inf Comput Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7505012", "ISSNLinking": "0095-2338"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15032509", "10.1021/ci030418r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
