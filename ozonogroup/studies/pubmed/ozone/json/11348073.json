Reaction products and aerosol formation from the kinetic model were compared to outdoor smog chamber experiments conducted under natural sunlight in the presence of NOx and in the dark in the presence of O3. The gas-particle partitioning of semivolatile organics generated in the gas phase was treated as an equilibrium process between particle absorption and desorption. Models vs experimental aerosol yields illustrate that reasonable predictions of secondary aerosol formation are possible from both dark ozone and light NOx/alpha-pinene systems over a variety of different outdoor conditions. On average, measured gas- and particle-phase products accounted for approximately 54-72% of the reacted alpha-pinene carbon. Model predictions suggest that organic nitrates account for another approximately 25% of the reacted carbon, and most of this is in the gas phase. Measured particle-phase products accounted for 60-100% of the particle filter mass, with pinic acid and pinonic acid being the primary aerosol-phase products. In the gas phase, pinonaldehyde and pinonic acid are major products. Model simulations of these and other products show generally reasonable fits to the experimental data from the perspective of timing and concentrations. These results are very encouraging for a compound such as pinonaldehyde, since it is being formed from OH attack on alpha-pinene and is also simultaneously photolyzed and reacted with OH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400, USA. kamens@unc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamens", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaoui", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11348073", "10.1021/es001626s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
