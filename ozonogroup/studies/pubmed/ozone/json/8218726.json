The covalent immobilization was accomplished through amide formation between amino groups of trypsin and carboxyl groups of grafted PAAc chains, with the use of water-soluble carbodiimide. A set of samples with surface concentrations of grafted polymer ranging from 0.03 to 2.5 micrograms/cm2 was used to study the effects of grafted layer on the enzymatic activity of immobilized trypsin and its inhibition by trypsin inhibitors of different molecular sizes. The amount of immobilized trypsin increased linearly with an increase in graft yield of fibres, but the activity of immobilized enzyme reached saturation at a certain graft yield, probably because of diffusion limitation for the transport of enzyme substrate molecules into the grafted PAAc layer. The reduction of inhibition with an increase in graft yield and in molecular weight of inhibitors was attributed to enhancement of steric hindrance and enzyme inactivation in the dense grafted layer. We also found that the adsorbed trypsin was inhibited more easily than the covalently immobilized at any concentration of the grafted PAAc and for any type of inhibitor used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biomedical Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulik", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanchenko", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biomaterials", "NlmUniqueID": "8100316", "ISSNLinking": "0142-9612"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes, Immobilized"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Terephthalates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Q93RCW27E", "NameOfSubstance": "carbopol 940"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes, Immobilized"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Terephthalates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8218726", "10.1016/0142-9612(93)90041-y", "0142-9612(93)90041-Y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
