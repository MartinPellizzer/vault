The groups were divided as follows: Test group (n\u00a0=\u00a014): after removal of the free gingival graft (FGG), the palatal wound was treated with ozonized seed sunflower oil with a peroxide index between 510 and 625\u00a0meq O<sub>2</sub> /kg; Control group (n\u00a0=\u00a014): after removal of the FGG, the palatal wound was treated with non-ozonated sunflower oil (placebo).
