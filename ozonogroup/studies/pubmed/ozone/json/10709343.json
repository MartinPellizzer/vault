The UV exposure is known to cause skin carcinoma, cataract and deteriorated immune function, but for countries like Japan, the magnitude of health effects of UV radiation is yet to be elucidated. The International Workshop on the Health Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation was held in Tokyo, Japan, on February 17-19, 1999, in attempts to visualize the size of this problem and to identify better solutions. Through this workshop, several lines of scientific evidence were provided, which clearly show that the risk of cataract and skin cancer among people living in Japan increases with the increasing level of sun exposure. We must seek, therefore, the extent to which the UV exposure of given intensity causes adverse health effects in Japanese population. Through the workshop, the importance of preventive measure was confirmed. The scientific basis of prevention is, of course, the knowledge of dose-response relationship and the current exposure status in Japanese population. It is hoped that the communications between researchers in Japan and other countries are strengthened through this workshop."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Information and Epidemiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinjo", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akiba", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9607688", "ISSNLinking": "0917-5040"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cataract"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Primary Prevention"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "17"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10709343", "10.2188/jea.9.6sup_1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
