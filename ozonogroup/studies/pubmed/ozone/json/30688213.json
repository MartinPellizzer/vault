However, most studies are cross-sectional and the results are controversial. This study investigated the associations between air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub>) and semen quality among sperm donation candidates, especially when the air pollution was artificially controlled in Beijing, China. We analyzed 8945 semen samples in the human sperm bank of Peking University Third Hospital (Beijing, China) from October 2015 to May 2018. Air pollution data during the entire period (0-90 days prior) and key stages (0-9, 10-14, and 70-90 days prior) of sperm development were collected from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre. The association between air pollutants and semen parameters (sperm concentration and progressive motility) was analyzed by a mixed model adjusted for age, abstinence duration, month, and average ambient temperature. Only O<sub>3</sub>during key stages of 0-9 days and 10-14 days and the entire period was negatively associated with sperm concentration between 2015 and 2018 (P < 0.01). During the period of air pollution control from November 2017 to January 2018, except for the increase in O<sub>3</sub>concentration, other five pollutants' concentrations decreased compared to those in previous years. In this period, the sperm concentration decreased (P < 0.001). During the pollution-control period, O<sub>3</sub>exposure 10-14 days prior was negatively associated with sperm concentration (95% CI: -0.399--0.111; P < 0.001). No significant association was found between the other five pollutants and semen quality during that period. Our study suggested that only O<sub>3</sub>exposure was harmful to semen quality. Therefore, O<sub>3</sub>should not be neglected during pollution control operation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Peking University
