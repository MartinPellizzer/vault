Decolourisation was very effective at both acidic and alkaline pH. The colour of the aqueous solution was below detectable limit after 30\u2005min at 1.7\u2005mg/s ozone generation rate. The reaction between the dye and ozone was first-order in nature with respect to both ozone and the dye. The enhancement factor increased with increasing dye concentration. The samples were analysed by the ultra-violet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. From the GC-MS analysis, 13 intermediates were detected as oxidation products of this dye at various stages of oxidation. The changes in the FTIR spectra showed the destruction of the dye and the formation of new compounds. The oxidation mechanism was divided into two reaction pathways. The mineralisation of Brilliant Green was up to 80% in 60\u2005min, as determined by total organic carbon analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Chemical Engineering , Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati , Guwahati 781039 , Assam , India."}], "LastName": "Khuntia", "ForeName": "Snigdha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Majumder", "ForeName": "Subrata Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Pallab", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G0L543D370", "NameOfSubstance": "brilliant green"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Failure Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbubbles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25514135", "10.1080/09593330.2014.946971"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
