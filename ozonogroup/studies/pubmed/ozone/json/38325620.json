The UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment was effective in the removal of most MPs, whereas chlorination was selectively effective for 19\u00a0MPs, including EDCs (>70 %). MPs containing aromatic ring with electron-donating functional group, or primary and secondary amines were effectively removed by chlorination immediately upon reaction initiation. The removal of MPs by ozonation was generally lower than that of the other two processes at a low ozone dose (1\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), but higher than chlorination at a high ozone dose (3\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), particularly for 16\u00a0MPs, including T&Os. Compared in deionized water, the removals of MPs in the raw water samples were lower in all three processes. The regression models predicting the rate constants (k<sub>obs</sub>) of 53\u00a0MPs showed good agreement between modeled and measured value for UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.948) and chlorination (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.973), despite using only dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxidant concentration as variables, whereas the ozonation model showed a variation (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.943). Our results can provide the resources for determining which oxidative process is suitable for treating specific MPs present in the raw waters of DWTPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
