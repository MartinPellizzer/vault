In reporting the formation by the National Academy of Sciences of a Committee on Environmental Research to be headed by Cornell President Emeritus Dale Corson (11 October, p. 192), we inexplicably fused the distinguished careers of physicist Corson and former Dartmouth president John Kemeny. It was the latter who headed the President's Commission that investigated the accident at Three Mile Island, whereas Corson's distinctions include heading the NAS's \"Corson Panel\" on scientific communications and national security and founding the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable.
