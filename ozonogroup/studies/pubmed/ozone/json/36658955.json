The mostly reported fabrication method of CNT-TFT is a lift-off based photolithography process. In such fabrication process, photoresist (PR) residue contaminates the interface of tube-metal contact and deteriorates the device performance. In this paper, ultraviolet ozone (UVO) and oxygen plasma treatments were employed to remove the PR contamination. Through our well-designed experiments, the UVO treatment is confirmed an effective way of cleaning contamination at the tube-metal interface, while oxygen plasma treatment is too reactive and hard to control, which is not appropriate for CNT-TFTs. It is determined that 2-6\u202fmin UVO treatment is the preferred window, and the best optimized treatment time is 4\u202fmin, which leads to 15% enhancement of device performance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Science China Press.
