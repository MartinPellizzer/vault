Surface properties of the ACs were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K were investigated by BET and D-A methods to characterize the specific surface area, total pore volume, and micropore volume. The ammonia removal efficiency was confirmed by the gas-detecting tube technique. The results showed that the specific surface area and micropore volume of ACs were slightly destroyed as the ozone treatment time increased. However, the ozone treatment led to an increase in ammonia removal efficiency of ACs, mainly due to an increase of acid functional groups, such as carbonyl and ether groups, on carbon surfaces. It was revealed that the improvement of ammonia removal efficiency of ACs was greatly affected by the interfacial acid-base interactions between modified ACs and basic ammonia adsorbate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Materials Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, P.O.
