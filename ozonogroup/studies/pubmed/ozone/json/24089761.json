Ivanov and D. Babikov, J. Chem. Phys. 134, 144107 (2011)]. Numerical tests are conducted to assess its efficiency and accuracy, compared to the original version of the method, where rotation of the molecule in space is treated explicitly and adiabatically. New approach is considerably faster and helps blocking the artificial ro-vibrational transitions at the pre- and post-collisional stages of the process. Although molecular orientation in space is fixed, the energy exchange between rotational, vibrational, and translational digresses of freedom still occurs, allowing to compute ro-vibrational excitation and quenching. Behavior of the energy transfer function through eight orders of magnitude range of values and in a broad range of \u0394E is reproduced well. In the range of moderate -500 \u2264 \u0394E \u2264 +500 cm(-1) the approximate method is rather accurate. The absolute values of stabilization cross sections for scattering resonances trapped behind the centrifugal threshold are a factor 2-to-3 smaller (compared to the explicit-rotation approach). This performance is acceptable and similar to the well-known sudden-rotation approximation in the time-independent inelastic scattering methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Wehr Chemistry Building, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teplukhin", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "Mikhail", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babikov", "ForeName": "Dmitri", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24089761", "10.1063/1.4821349"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
