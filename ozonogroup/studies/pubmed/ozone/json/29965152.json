In this study, two sulfonamides resistant bacteria isolated from secondary effluents of a municipal wastewater treatment plant were used to compare the efficacy of three different disinfection processes (chlorination, ultraviolet and ozone) in reducing sulfonamides resistance pollution using serial dilution plate counting method and qPCR. The behavior characteristics of sulfonamides resistance genes during the disinfection process were elucidated using disinfection+DNase\u2160 treatment. The results showed that all three disinfection techniques could reduce the concentration of target bacteria, but the abundance of sulfonamides resistance genes was still at a high level. Furthermore, chlorination disinfection might reduce sulfonamides resistance genes by reducing microbial biomass. Ultraviolet disinfection could damage genes directly. However, during ozone disinfection, sulfonamides resistance genes would escape to environment, and its potential environmental risks could not be ignored."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhen-Chao", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Environmental Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfonamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Halogenation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfonamides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965152", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201610059"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
