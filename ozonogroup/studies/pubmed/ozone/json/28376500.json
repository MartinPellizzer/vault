An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to evaluate the chronological change in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and eotaxin expressions. CCR3 and VEGF subtype expression in the retina was examined using real-time RT-PCR, and CCR3, eotaxin, VEGF-A, and CD31 expression was examined immunohistochemically. A CCR3 neutralizing antibody (Ab) was injected into the vitreous humor on both postnatal days 12 (P12) and 14 (P14). Retinal neovascularizations were quantified by measurement of the percentages of neovascular area.", "The mean eotaxin and VEGF-A protein level was significantly downregulated at P10 and P12 and was significantly upregulated at P14 and P17 (p < 0.05). CCR3 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated at P12 (p < 0.05). VEGF164 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated at P14 (p < 0.05). The areas of vaso-obliteration and neovascularization were significantly suppressed in anti-CCR3 Ab-treated eyes (p < 0.05). Anti-CCR3 Ab treatment suppressed VEGF and eotaxin but not monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. And VEGF 164 mRNA but not VEGF120 mRNA was suppressed by anti-CCR3 Ab treatment.", "The present data suggest that anti-CCR3 treatment can suppress retinal neovascularization.
