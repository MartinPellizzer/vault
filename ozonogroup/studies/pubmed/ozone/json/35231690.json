Understanding the CL from molecular insight level is the requirement for further disposal based on their components. Here, typical CL samples were collected from the multi-stage membrane separation process in a large-scale leachate plant, including nanofiltration (NF), primary ultrafiltration (PUF), secondary nanofiltration (SNF), and reverse osmosis (RO). More than 95% of DOM was removed from raw CL, of which about 3/4 flowed into PUFCL and 1/5 flowed into SNFCL. DOM with macro-molecular weight (>500\u00a0Da, 30.46%) and highly unsaturated compounds (double-bond equivalents >15) were detected in PUFCL. Nearly half of DOM was CHO-only compounds (42.04%) in SNFCL. PUFCL was abundant in heteroatom species with higher-order oxygen (O\u00a0\u2265\u00a010), which was coincident with the trend of humic substance distribution (humic substance >1/2). Based on these properties results, advanced oxidation processes, such as ozonation, might be the right process for SNFCL rich in heteroatom species with low-order oxygen (O\u00a0<\u00a010). Abundant disulfides (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2-6</sub> classes, 20.19%) and monovalent salts existed in ROCL, which should be removed from the system. These findings might provide basic information for the treatment of CLs from different membranes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
