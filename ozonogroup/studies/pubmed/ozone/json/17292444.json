Reactive dyes with representative chromophores and anchor groups were chosen for the research project. Different stages of oxidative decolourisation were examined and determined by water parameters for biological degradation (BOD). The paper focuses on toxicity tests with Pseudomonas putida to consider whether the oxidative treatments result in products with a risk for the environment. Tests were performed with the AQUALYTIC Sensomat System, which measures biological oxygen demand (BOD). It was determined that the chosen oxidative treatments had as a rule no bearing on respiration of P. putida. Experiments with hydrolysates after short-term UV irradiation resulted in a slightly increased but not long-lasting toxicity in comparison with treatments with ozone or NaPS. Toxic effects were found in tests with hydrolysates of metalliferous dyes. During oxidative treatment, metals were liberated from the chromophores. This did cause complete inhibition of respiration of P. putida. Dye Blue E, a member of a dye class with chlorotriazine anchor groups, was itself found to be toxic, caused by the reactivity of the anchor group. The hydrolysate is only of minor toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Institut f\u00fcr Lebensmittel- und Bioverfahrenstechnik, Bergstrasse 120, DE-01069 Dresden, Germany. elke.boschke@tu-dresden.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boschke", "ForeName": "Elke", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00f6hmer", "ForeName": "Ulrike", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lange", "ForeName": "J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Constapel", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schellentr\u00e4ger", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bley", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas putida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17292444", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.12.041", "S0045-6535(06)01791-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
