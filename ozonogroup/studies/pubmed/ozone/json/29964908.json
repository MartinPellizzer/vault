The results showed that net photosynthetic rate (<i>P</i><sub>n</sub>), transpiration rate (<i>T</i><sub>r</sub>), water use efficiency (WUE), apparent electron transport rate (ETR), excitation energy capture efficiency of PS\u2161 reaction center (<i>F</i>'<sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i>'<sub>m</sub>), coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP), actual photochemical efficiency of PS\u2161 in the light (PhiPS2), chlorophyll a (Chla), chlorophyll b (Chlb), total chlorophyll (Chla+b) and carotenoid (Car)contents were significantly decreased with the increasing ozone concentrations. However, intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (<i>c</i><sub>i</sub>) was significantly increased and stomatal conductance (<i>G</i><sub>s</sub>) remained unchanged. There was significant difference in photosynthetic characteristics among three genotypes of poplar. The genotype'546' showed a significant linear correlation (<i>P</i><0.01) between photosynthetic parameters (except <i>G</i><sub>s</sub>) and the ozone dose index AOT40(accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration over a threshold of 40 nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup> during daylight hours). Among the three genotypes of poplar, photosynthesis pigments contents in '546' significantly declined with the increase of ozone concentration but not in '90' and '84K'. According to the linear relationship of most photosynthetic parameters and AOT40, especially the total chlorophyll, '546' showed the maximum slope, follows by '90' and then '84K'. So the order of the ozone sensitivity of three poplar genotypes was '546'> '90'> '84K'. The results of this study can provide an important basis for breeding ozone resistant genotype of poplar as well as protecting poplar from ozone damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5712ZB110R", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorophyll b"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Populus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964908", "10.13227/j.hjkx.2016.06.046"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
