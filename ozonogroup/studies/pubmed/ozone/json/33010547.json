In this study, a novel catalyst, ferrosilicon, was selected as the catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation to degrade ibuprofen (IBP) in water and treat real pharmaceutical wastewater. During the procedure, 45<sup>#</sup>ferrosilicon exhibited the best catalytic activity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the IBP removal reached 75%, which was a great improvement compared to the 37% removal by ozone alone. The 45<sup>#</sup>-ferrosilicon-catalysed ozonation also achieved 68% TOC removal for real pharmaceutical wastewater, which was 31% higher than that by ozone alone. The degradation pathway of IBP was proposed using GC/MS. The EPR test proved that the main active species in the system were free active radicals \u2022OH, and the measured accumulative \u2022OH amount was 102\u202f\u03bcmol. The characterization results show that the nascent metallic oxides, hydroxides, and hydroxyoxides on the ferrosilicon surface facilitated the decomposition of ozone molecules and generation of free active radicals. The removal of target organic contaminants in the water was mainly attributed to the oxidization of these highly active species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
