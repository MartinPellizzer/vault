It was proposed that the progenitor may have been a massive evolved star similar to eta Carinae, which resides in our own Galaxy at a distance of about 2.3 kpc. eta Carinae appears ready to detonate. Although it is too distant to pose a serious threat as a normal supernova, and given that its rotation axis is unlikely to produce a gamma-ray burst oriented toward Earth, eta Carinae is about 30,000 times nearer than 2006gy, and we re-evaluate it as a potential superluminous supernova. We have found that, given the large ratio of emission in the optical to the X-ray, atmospheric effects are negligible. Ionization of the atmosphere and concomitant ozone depletion are unlikely to be important. Any cosmic ray effects should be spread out over approximately 10(4) y and similarly unlikely to produce any serious perturbation to the biosphere. We also discuss a new possible effect of supernovae-e-ndocrine disruption induced by blue light near the peak of the optical spectrum. This is a possibility for nearby supernovae at distances too large to be considered \"dangerous\" for other reasons. However, due to reddening and extinction by the interstellar medium, eta Carinae is unlikely to trigger such effects to any significant degree."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Washburn University, Topeka, Kansas 66621, USA. brian.thomas@washburn.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Brian C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melott", "ForeName": "Adrian L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fields", "ForeName": "Brian D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anthony-Twarog", "ForeName": "Barbara J", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Astrobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "101088083", "ISSNLinking": "1557-8070"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cosmic Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Earth, Planet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18199005", "10.1089/ast.2007.0181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
