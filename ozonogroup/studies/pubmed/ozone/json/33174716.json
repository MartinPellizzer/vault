However, recent studies suggest that ground surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased over the same period. To understand the shift in air pollutants and to comprehensively evaluate their impacts on health, a spatiotemporal model for O<sub>3</sub> is required for exposure assessment. This study presents a data-fusion algorithm for O<sub>3</sub> estimation that combines <i>in situ</i> observations, satellite remote sensing measurements, and model results from the community multiscale air quality model. Performance of the algorithm for O<sub>3</sub> estimation was evaluated by five-fold cross-validation. The estimates are highly correlated with the <i>in situ</i> observations of the maximum daily 8 h averaged O<sub>3</sub> (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.70). The mean modeling error (measured using the root-mean-squared error) is 26 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, which accounts for 29% of the mean level. We also found that satellite O<sub>3</sub> played a key role to improve model performance, particularly during warm months. The estimates were further used to illustrate spatiotemporal variation in O<sub>3</sub> during 2013-2017 for the whole country. In contrast to the reduced trend of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, we found that the population-weighted O<sub>3</sub> mean increased from 86 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in 2013 to 95 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in 2017, with a rate of 2.07 (95% CI: 1.65, 2.48) \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> per year at the national level. This increased trend in O<sub>3</sub> suggests that it is becoming an important contributor to the burden of diseases attributable to air pollutants in China. The developed method and the results generated from this study can be used to support future health-related studies in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7045-2307"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Reproductive and Child Health / Ministry of Health Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Air Quality Simulation and System Analysis, Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yixuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1605-8448"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Guannan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Qingyang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education, & NHC Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York 14214, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2202-6829"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing 100048, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Nana", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2752-7924"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BIC-ESAT and SKL-ESPC, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33174716", "10.1021/acs.est.0c03098"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
