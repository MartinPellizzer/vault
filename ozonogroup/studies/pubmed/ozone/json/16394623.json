The experiment was performed on 5-month-old rats exposed to ozone (0.5 ppm) for 50 days (5 h daily). Simultaneously, the animals were injected with the vitamins in 5-day intervals and at different doses (0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 5 and 15 mg of vitamin E; 0.5, 3, 9, and 50 mg of vitamin C; or both vitamins together, respectively). Gonad sections were PAS stained. In the ozonized males, depletion of germ cells occurred. In the vitamin E groups, the testes were comparable to the controls, excluding the 0.5-mg-dose vitamin E group in which perivascular fibrosis and intertubular hyalinization were observed. In the vitamin C groups, intertubular hyalinization, partial arrested spermatogenesis, and desquamation of the seminiferous epithelium appeared proportional to the vitamin dose. Additionally, premature spermiation was found at a vitamin C dose of 50-mg. In the rats injected with both vitamins, hyalinization and fibrosis appeared in addition to partial arrest of spermatogenesis and vacuolar degeneration. In conclusion, vitamin E protects against the detrimental effects of ozone in rat testes irrespective of the dose applied. This was not observed for vitamin C. Moreover, administration of higher doses of vitamin C intensified the damage to the testes caused by ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pathophysiology, Department of Pathology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland. maried@uwm.edu.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jedlinska-Krakowska", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bomba", "ForeName": "Grazyna", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jakubowski", "ForeName": "Karol", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rotkiewicz", "ForeName": "Tadeusz", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jana", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Penkowski", "ForeName": "Aleksander", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Reprod Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "9438792", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8818"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16394623", "10.1262/jrd.17028", "JST.JSTAGE/jrd/17028"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
