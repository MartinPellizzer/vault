The solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE/GC-MS) was developed to identify byproducts. The results showed that 99.84% of AAF could be removed by the O<sub>3</sub>/VUV, and the AAF degradation was enhanced at higher O<sub>3</sub> dosage and initial solution pH. The radical scavenging tests revealed that most of AAF was degraded by OH\u2022 radicals, and the O<sub>3</sub>/UV<sub>254nm</sub> made the main contribution in AAF degradation in the O<sub>3</sub>/VUV system. The mineralization extents of C, S, P and N elements of AAF at 180\u2005min reached 47.74%, 93.94%, 17.71% and 45.81%, respectively. At initial pH\u2009>\u200910.0, the EE/O values of AAF degradation by the O<sub>3</sub>/VUV was below 7.0\u2005kWh\u2005m<sup>-3</sup> per order, showing the energy consumption was acceptable. The SPE/GC-MS analysis showed that toxic aniline was generated in the O<sub>3</sub>/VUV oxidation of AAF, but it was further degraded at a longer time. Compared to the ozonation, the O<sub>3</sub>/VUV had a much lower content of aniline at 180\u2005min. The possible degradation pathways of AAF by the O<sub>3</sub>/VUV were proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resources Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of High-efficient Mining and Safety of Metal Mines, Ministry of Education, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6956-1004"], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Pingfeng", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resources Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yanhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resources Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Bolan", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resources Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gen", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Resources Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xiaofeng", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31288622", "10.1080/09593330.2019.1642389"]}}]}
