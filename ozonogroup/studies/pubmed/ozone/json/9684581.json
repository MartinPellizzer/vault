With the BAL fluid recovered, total and differential cell counts were made, and ferruginous bodies were isolated by sodium hypochlorite digestion. They were counted by light microscopy and evaluated as a marker of exposure to particulate pollutants.", "There was no significant difference in the total cell count or in the macrophage number between the five groups. The neutrophil count was statistically higher in dogs from the southwest area as compared to the northeast and rural areas (P < .05). The lymphocyte count was significantly greater in the southwest, also. The northeast part of the city showed the highest number of FB in BAL fluids.", "The most polluted areas, in terms of particulate matter, were the northeast and the northwest; those are the locations of heavy industry.
