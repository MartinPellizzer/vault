BrO radicals have been identified as key oxidants during mercury depletion events observed in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. We report the first experimental product study of BrO-initiated oxidation of elemental mercury at atmospheric pressure of ca. 0.987 bar and T= 296+/-2 K. We used chemical ionization and electron impact mass spectrometry, gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer, a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, a cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive spectrometry. BrO radicals were formed using visible and UV photolysis of Br2 and CH2Br2 in the presence of ozone. We have analyzed the products in the gas phase, on suspended aerosols and on wall deposits, and identified HgBr, HgBrO/HgOBr, and HgO as reaction products. Mercury aerosols with a characteristic width of ca. 0.2 microm were observed as products. We herein discuss the implications of our results to the chemistry of atmospheric mercury and its potential implications in the biogeochemical cycling of mercury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Chemistry and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 2K6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raofie", "ForeName": "Farhad", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ariya", "ForeName": "Parisa A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15382859", "10.1021/es035339a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
