However, chemical boundary condition (CBC) is an important input of these models and contributes to the model bias against observations. In this study, we develop a tool named GC2CMAQ that provides the CMAQ model with the CBCs from the GEOS-Chem simulation. Two experiments using different CBCs were conducted to evaluate their effect on seasonal O<sub>3</sub> simulation in China. The Default experiment utilized the model-default static condition (the relatively clean atmosphere in the eastern United States), and the GC experiment employed the GEOS-Chem simulation results. Compared with the observation, the GC experiment has a much better performance in reproducing elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels in the higher troposphere and lower stratosphere during different seasons. Near the earth's surface, the simulated concentrations of pollutants O<sub>3</sub> (and PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the GC experiment were also closer to the observation in April and July. The accuracy of simulation results in provinces close to the boundary was improved by approximately 20\u00a0%-30\u00a0% relative to the Default experiment. The CBCs provided by GEOS-Chem enabled a better simulation of stratosphere-troposphere O<sub>3</sub> exchange in late spring and early summer, which then affected the pollutant concentration near surfaces through vertical transport. This finding was confirmed by a case study in southwestern Tibet on April 28, 2017, in which we quantified the contributions of different physical and chemical processes to O<sub>3</sub> variations at different altitudes using the process analysis method. This study highlights the importance of using a reliable CBC for the regional chemical transport model to derive a better performance of O<sub>3</sub> simulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
