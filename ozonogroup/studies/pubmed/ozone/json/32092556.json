This novel method may exploit high-throughput manufacture without chemical etchants or elevated temperatures for thin-film electronics.", "The mechanism for selective wetting arose from O<sub>3</sub> treatment of PDMS through a shadow-mask to vary surface-energy due to formation of polar silanol (Si-OH) replacing surface methyl groups leading to contact angle reduction from 40\u00b0-9\u00b0 for oil on PDMS. Oiled PDMS was (1) metalized itself and (2) used as a stamp to print onto polyethylene-terephthalate, consisting of oil pick-up/de-wetting/transfer-to-substrate/metallization.", "Ag (520-568\u00a0nm) thick was deposited outside oiled regions, surpassing ~20\u00a0\u03bcm resolution of commercial printing. On metalized PDMS, minimum line widths were 2.6\u00a0\u03bcm (with 10\u00a0\u03bcm edge-grading from centrifugal oil spreading) or widths of 24\u00a0\u03bcm (no Ag grading) following spin-coating/roll-coating oil respectively. The progressive effect of thinning oil via five successive stamp-to-substrate impressions, produced line widths of 14\u00a0\u03bcm (with graded edge of 7.6\u00a0\u03bcm via spreading from stamp-substrate compression). Developments may reduce reliance on laser engraving/photocuring, and could enhance micro-contact printing through liquid dynamics vs. topographical relief structures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
