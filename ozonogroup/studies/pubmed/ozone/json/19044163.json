The method is used to characterize total and air-cleaner-specific particle removal rates during operation of four in-duct air cleaners and two portable air-cleaning devices in a fully instrumented test home. Operation of in-duct and portable air cleaners typically increased particle removal rates over the baseline rates determined in the absence of operating a central fan or an indoor air cleaner. Removal rates of 0.3- to 0.5-microm particles ranged from 1.5 hr(-1) during operation of an in-duct, 5-in. pleated media filter to 7.2 hr(-1) for an in-duct electrostatic air cleaner in comparison to a baseline rate of 0 hr(-1) when the air handler was operating without a filter. Removal rates for total particulate matter less than 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) mass concentrations were 0.5 hr(-1) under baseline conditions, 0.5 hr(-1) during operation of three portable ionic air cleaners, 1 hr(-1) for an in-duct 1-in. media filter, 2.4 hr(-1) for a single high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) portable air cleaner, 4.6 hr(-1) for an in-duct 5-in. media filter, 4.7 hr(-1) during operation of five portable HEPA filters, 6.1 hr(-1) for a conventional in-duct electronic air cleaner, and 7.5 hr(-1) for a high efficiency in-duct electrostatic air cleaner. Corresponding whole house clean air delivery rates for PM2.5 attributable to the air cleaner independent of losses within the central ventilation system ranged from 2 m3/min for the conventional media filter to 32 m3/min for the high efficiency in-duct electrostatic device. Except for the portable ionic air cleaner, the devices considered here increased particle removal indoors over baseline deposition rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health & Engineering, Inc., Needham, MA 02494, USA. dmacintosh@eheinc.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Macintosh", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myatt", "ForeName": "Theodore A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludwig", "ForeName": "Jerry F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "Brian J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "Helen H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spengler", "ForeName": "John D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Meteorology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19044163", "10.3155/1047-3289.58.11.1474"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
