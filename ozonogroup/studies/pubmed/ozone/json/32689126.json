In much of the world, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is the air pollutant most likely to be having adverse effects on the growth of plants. Here we describe the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> episodes (rising to 100 nL L<sup>-1</sup>), singly and in mixtures on the growth and physiology of an interamerican hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa L. (Torr. & Gray ex Hook.) \u00d7 P. deltoids Bartr. ex Marsh). 700 \u03bcL L<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> increased all growth variables relative to values in 350 \u03bcL\u2009L<sup>-1</sup>. Mainstem dry weight showed a 38% increase in year 1 and a 32% increase in year 2. Ozone episodes reduced mainstem dry mass by 45% in 350 \u03bcL L<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> and by 34% in 700 \u03bcL L<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub>. A\u2009/\u2009C<sub>i</sub> analysis showed limited effects on photosynthetic efficiency of 700 \u03bcL L<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> but in contrast, V<sub>cmax</sub> was reduced by O<sub>3</sub> episodes. CO<sub>2</sub> tended to increase leaf expansion but O<sub>3</sub> episodes reduced expansion rates generally although a short period of increased leaf expansion in response to O<sub>3</sub> was also observed. O<sub>3</sub> reduced leaf solute potentials (\u03a8s) and increased turgor (P) in young leaves. Cell wall properties (elasticity and plasticity) were both stimulated by ozone and this was associated with increased leaf expansion. A new mechanism is proposed which suggests that O<sub>3</sub> may act directly on the cell wall, attacking polysaccharides in the wall that result in altered cell wall properties and leaf growth. O<sub>3</sub> episodes increased leaf loss, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> delayed abscission and O<sub>3</sub> was less effective at accelerating leaf loss in elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Overall CO<sub>2</sub> increased growth, O<sub>3</sub> caused decreases and the treatment combination gave intermediate effects. Thus O<sub>3</sub> episodes are less likely to be detrimental to P. trichocarpa \u00d7 P. deltoides in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer, East Sussex, BN1 9QG, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardner", "ForeName": "Simon D L", "Initials": "SDL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forest Research, Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, FARNHAM, Surrey, GU10 4LH, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freer-Smith", "ForeName": "Peter H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Bassett Crescent East, University of Southampton, SO16 7PX, UK.Corresponding author.
