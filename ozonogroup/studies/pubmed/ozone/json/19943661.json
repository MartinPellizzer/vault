Components of photochemical smog can increase the degradation of binders in lead paint, leading to increased release of lead pigment granules to hands in surface contact or for deposition in house dust and soil. This study uses photochemical air quality modeling to map areas susceptible to increased lead paint degradation as a result of photochemical atmospheric pollutants to prioritize areas of concern. Typical air quality episodes in the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) are modeled for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Results indicate that large areas of the SoCAB were susceptible to atmospheric-driven accelerated lead paint degradation. Inner city urban areas from central Los Angeles to Azusa and most of Orange County had the highest susceptibility to accelerated lead paint degradation, followed by inland locations near the San Bernardino Mountains. This study identifies photochemical oxidant gases as contributors to greater lead release from indoor painted surfaces in urban areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, University of California at Irvine, California 92697-3975, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cohan", "ForeName": "Alexander J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "Rufus D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleinman", "ForeName": "Michael T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dabdub", "ForeName": "Donald", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Paint"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19943661", "10.1021/es901360j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
