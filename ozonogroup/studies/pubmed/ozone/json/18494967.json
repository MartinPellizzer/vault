P (8% carbamide peroxide solution) and the P/TM (50:50) blend were prepared freshly as required. The specimens were divided randomly into six groups: Group A - ozone followed by P; Group B - ozone concurrently with P; Group C - P alone; Group D - ozone followed by P/TM; Group E - ozone concurrently with P/TM; and Group F - P/TM alone. Ozone exposure was of 40 seconds duration. Digital photographic images were recorded at baseline and endpoint under standardized lighting and desiccation conditions. CIELAB L*a*b* values were determined.", "The addition of TM to P or the application of ozone with P did not significantly affect bleaching effectiveness compared with P alone. The application of ozone prior to P significantly decreased bleaching effectiveness as indicated by the DeltaL*, Deltaa*, DeltaE and %L* values. The addition of TM to the P did enhance the aesthetic by increasing the lustre and translucency of the treated enamel.", "The results of this study suggest that Tooth Mousse may be applied concurrently with the bleach, and not reduce bleaching effectiveness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Research Centre for Oral Health Science, School of Dental Science and the Bio21 Institute of Molecular Science and Biotechnology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manton", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhide", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopcraft", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reynolds", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust Dent J", "NlmUniqueID": "0370612", "ISSNLinking": "0045-0421"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate nanocomplex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31PZ2VAU81", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamide Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbamide Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lighting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optics and Photonics"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photography, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Discoloration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18494967", "10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00021.x", "ADJ021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
