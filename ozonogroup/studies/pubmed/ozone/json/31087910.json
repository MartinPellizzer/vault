The squared correlation coefficient (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) of the hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations forecast was 0.84. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 3.44\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and 24.48, respectively. The key factors for the hourly O<sub>3</sub> forecast were the O<sub>3</sub> pre-concentrations, amount of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB), and the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The main factors for the O<sub>3</sub> daily maximum forecast were the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> concentrations at 07:00 and the UVB level. Temperature and UVB played an important role in predicting O<sub>3</sub> 8 h. In general, taking precursors into account could increase the accuracy of O<sub>3</sub> prediction by 10%-28%. For O<sub>3</sub> concentration forecasting, SVMr gave significantly better predictions than multiple linear regression methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qian", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jun-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Weather Modification Office of Qinghai Province, Xining 810001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meteorological Observation Centre of China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Jing-Shu", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-da", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Climate and Environment Change, Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087910", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201809134"]}}]}
