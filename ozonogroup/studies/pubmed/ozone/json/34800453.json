A time-stratified case-crossover study combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the ozone effect on stroke morbidity among T2D patients. Based on principal diagnosis, ischemic stroke cases were identified according to the International Classification of Diseases (I63), and a history of T2D was coded as E12.", "A total of 149,757 hospital admissions for ischemic stroke among T2D patients were recorded in Beijing. Approximately U-shaped exposure-response curves were observed for ozone and ischemic stroke morbidity among T2D patients. With a reference at 54.91\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, extreme-low (5th: 9.59\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) ozone was significantly associated with a decreased risk for ischemic stroke [RR\u00a0=\u00a00.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.98]. Subgroup analysis showed that extremely low-ozone (5th) level only had a significant protective effect in males and elderly population, with a RR value of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76-0.97) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.75-0.96), respectively. Extreme-high ozone (99th: 157.06\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) was significantly associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% CI: 1.12-1.57). The effect size was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.10-1.63) for males and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.07-1.63) for females, and the difference was not significant (Z\u00a0=\u00a0-0.29, P\u00a0=\u00a00.77). The effect size in younger adults was significantly higher than that in participants aged \u226565\u00a0years [1.52 (95% CI: 1.21-1.91) vs. 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01-1.47), Z\u00a0=\u00a0-1.62, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05].", "U-shaped associations were observed between ozone and ischemic stroke morbidity in T2D patients. Men and elderly population are vulnerable to low-ozone level, and the younger adults are more susceptible to extremely high-ozone level than the elderly."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
