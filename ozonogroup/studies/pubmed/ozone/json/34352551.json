Accordingly, previous review articles have focused on the photocatalytic properties of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based materials. However, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has several other notable features, such as high adsorption affinity towards aromatic substances and heavy metals, high thermal and chemical resistances, good compatibility with various materials, and easily scalable synthesis; therefore, in addition to simple photocatalysis, it can be widely used in other decontamination systems based on activation of oxidants and electrocatalysis. This critical review provides a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based materials and their use in treating polluted water and wastewater via the following routes (1) activation of oxidizing agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, ozone, peroxymonosulfate, and persulfate): and (2) photoelectrocatalysis using fabricated g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based photocathodes and photoanodes. For each route, we briefly summarize the primary mechanisms, distinctive features, and performances of various water treatment systems using g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based catalysts. We also highlight the specific roles of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in improving the efficiencies of these treatment processes. The advantages and limitations of previously reported water treatment systems using g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based materials are also described and compared in this review. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of improving g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based water purification applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
