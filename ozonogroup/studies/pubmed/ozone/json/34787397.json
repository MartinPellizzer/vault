In this study, we innovatively use the Community Multiscale Air Quality model with the high-order decoupled direct method (CMAQ-HDDM) to simulate O<sub>3</sub> pollution of China in 2017 and derive O<sub>3</sub> isopleths for individual cities. Our simulation covering the entire China Mainland suggests severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution as 97% of the residents experienced at least 1 day, in 2017, in excess of Chinese Level-II Ambient Air Quality Standards for O<sub>3</sub> as 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (81.5 ppbV equally). The O<sub>3</sub> responses to emissions of precursors vary widely across individual cities. Densely populated metropolitan areas such as Jing-Jin-Ji, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta are following NO<i><sub>X</sub></i>-saturated regimes, where a small amount of NO<i><sub>X</sub></i> reduction increases O<sub>3</sub>. Ambient O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the eastern region generally is limited by VOCs, while in the west by NO<i><sub>X</sub></i>. The city-specific O<sub>3</sub> isopleths generated in this study are instrumental in forming hybrid and differentiated strategies for O<sub>3</sub> abatement in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1335-8477"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Huizhong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yilin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "Armistead G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yongtao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Odman", "ForeName": "Mehmet Tal\u00e2t", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6988-843X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Science, Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Archibald", "ForeName": "Alexander T", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7374-7063"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Sino-French Institute for Earth System Science, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34787397", "10.1021/acs.est.1c01567"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
