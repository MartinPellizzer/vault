RAA alterations were noticed immediately, 30 min and 120 min after termination of the exposure period, whereas CPK showed alterations immediately and 15 min after termination of the exposure. Later determinations, i.e., 24 hr after O3 exposure for RAA and 30 min after 03 exposure for CPK, revealed no significant differences when compared to control animals. Although differences in sensitivity existed, the dose response curves for both systems were more or less similar, showing a short decrease for the initial very low O3 doses, followed by a profound rise and a gradual decrease to control levels for subsequent ct doses. Exceptions were the 30 min curve for RAA and the immediate curve for CPK in so far as that both showed an additional depression. Neither plasma histamine nor plasma lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH3) were observed to be altered by the range of O3 doses employed. These findings were explained on the basis of adaptation of the organism to a potentially noxious O3 stimulus by enhanced metabolic processes: a weak stimulus leading to only a small adjustment, and stronger stimuli to elevated enzyme activity as well. With increasing doses of O3 this elevation in enzyme activity was found to be gradually diminished, possibly due to a steadily growing demand, leaving the overshoot becoming continually smaller until a balanced state is achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veninga", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wagenaar", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lemstra", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatine Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nature. 1976 Apr 22;260(5553):721-2", "ArticleIdList": ["1264246"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med. 1967 Nov;126(2):356-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6079903"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1958 Apr 26;181(4617):1202-3", "ArticleIdList": ["13541419"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1977 May-Jun;32(3):110-6", "ArticleIdList": ["869593"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1979 Apr;29:137-42", "ArticleIdList": ["510234"]}, {"Citation": "Lipids. 1972 Aug;7(8):518-24", "ArticleIdList": ["5055823"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1969 Apr;18(4):631-5", "ArticleIdList": ["4304420"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1974 OCT;29(4):203-10", "ArticleIdList": ["4414998"]}, {"Citation": "Radiat Res. 1974 Feb;57(2):311-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10874946"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Chim Acta. 1972 Mar;37:91-103", "ArticleIdList": ["5022125"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1967 Aug;20(2):246-57", "ArticleIdList": ["4167387"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1975 Jan;30(1):40-3", "ArticleIdList": ["1109271"]}, {"Citation": "J Lab Clin Med. 1978 Feb;91(2):328-39", "ArticleIdList": ["621431"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1976 Dec;18:141-6", "ArticleIdList": ["1030397"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1965 Sep;7(5):756-66", "ArticleIdList": ["4160100"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Health. 1973 Apr;26(4):205-8", "ArticleIdList": ["4266067"]}, {"Citation": "Int Arch Arbeitsmed. 1975;34(3):209-20", "ArticleIdList": ["1184201"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1979 Apr;18(2):336-46", "ArticleIdList": ["510254"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1978 Feb;22:91-2", "ArticleIdList": ["648495"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol. 1978 Mar-Apr;1(4):365-76", "ArticleIdList": ["722197"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7238452", "PMC1568736", "10.1289/ehp.8139153"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
