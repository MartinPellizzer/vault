We investigated in this study whether the edema, inflammation and ischemia caused by the trauma could be affected positively by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and ozone therapy.", "Soft tissue trauma was generated in a total of 63 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Subsequently, rats were divided into three groups. The first group was treated with ozone, the second group with HBO, and the third group served as controls. Tissue and blood samples were taken at the end of the procedures. Tissue lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), heme oxygenase (HO)-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 levels were detected. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to determine the inflammation and edema histopathologically.", "We also detected HIF-1 activity, which decreases when the oxygen concentration increases, HO-1 activity, which has anti-inflammatory effects, and iNOS activity, which releases in any type of acute case. We determined a statistically significant reduction in iNOS and LPO levels in both the HBO and Ozone groups. A significant decrease in inflammation was detected in both the Ozone and HBO groups compared with the Control group, and a significant decrease in edema was detected in all three groups.", "We think that HBO and Ozone therapy have beneficial effects on biochemical and histopathological findings. Related clinical trials will be helpful in clarifying the effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, GATA, Haydarpasa Military Hosital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey. draliosmanyildirim@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m", "ForeName": "Ali Osman", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ery\u0131lmaz", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kald\u0131r\u0131m", "ForeName": "Umit", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Hakkari Military Hospital, Hakkari, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Eyi", "ForeName": "Yusuf Emrah", "Initials": "YE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Tuncer", "ForeName": "Salim Kemal", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, GATA, Haydarpasa Military Hosital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ero\u011flu", "ForeName": "Murat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Durusu", "ForeName": "Murat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Topal", "ForeName": "Turgut", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kurt", "ForeName": "B\u00fclent", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Elaz\u0131\u011f Military Hospital, Elaz\u0131\u011f, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dilmen", "ForeName": "Serkan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, GATA, Haydarpa\u015fa Military Hosital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Bilgi\u00e7", "ForeName": "Serkan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, GATA School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Serdar", "ForeName": "Muhittin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg", "NlmUniqueID": "101274231", "ISSNLinking": "1306-696X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Hindlimb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hyperbaric Oxygenation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24936837", "10.5505/tjtes.2014.09465"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
