Radiolabel incorporation into metabolic products were determined at the end of 60 min perfusions with 50-55 nmol of [6-3H] [7, 10-14C] benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), which in unexposed lungs resulted in a total BaP utilization of 0.77 +/- 0.05 nmol [14C] BaP/h/lung, recovered bound to tissue macromolecules (12%), as tissue and perfusate ethyl acetate-soluble products (59%), and as perfusate water-soluble conjugates (29%). Total metabolism at the sixth position of the BaP molecule was indicated by a 3H2O production of 0.07 +/- 0.01 nmol BaP/h per lung, that resulted in the formation of quinones (33%), acid-hydrolysable (40%) and acid-resistant (27%) water-soluble products, indicated by 14C- minus 3H-labelling. Ozone-exposed lungs demonstrated an increased total [14C] BaP utilization to 3.05 +/- 0.05 nmol/h/lung. Although BaP metabolism to all products was increased, the proportion of metabolism involving the 6th position was enhanced from 10% to 25% of total BaP utilization, which was accounted for by relative increases in tissue retained quinones and in perfusate acid-hydrolysable conjugates. These data demonstrated that quinone formation represents a major pathway of lung polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism that is greatly enhanced in lungs with proliferating epithelia associated with oxidant exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassett", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bowen-Kelly", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seed", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03505", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-34674", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Commun Chem Pathol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0244734", "ISSNLinking": "0034-5164"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3175329"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
