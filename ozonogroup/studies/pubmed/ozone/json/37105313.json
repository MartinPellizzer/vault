Here, VOCs were vertically detected at three heights (47\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m and 320\u00a0m) along a 325\u00a0m tower of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in the mornings (8:00) and afternoons (15:00) from May 19 to June 18, 2021. The VOC concentrations in Beijing in summer were 16.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0ppbv, 14.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0ppbv and 14.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0ppbv at 47\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m and 320\u00a0m, respectively, and alkanes accounted for the largest proportion at all heights (>56%). The vertical gradients of the VOC concentrations and components did not significantly change, which was consistent with the summer observations of other stations in North China in recent years, but these results significantly differed from observations from more than a decade ago. To determine the reason for this, a classification based on atmospheric stability was performed, revealing that the vertical distribution of VOCs was uniform in convective and stable conditions and decreased with increasing height in neutral condition. With the transition of atmospheric stability from neutral to convective to stable, the contributions of fuel combustion sources and solvent use sources gradually increased, while those of biogenic sources and background sources gradually decreased. With increasing height, the contributions of background sources increased, those of biogenic sources, solvent use and gasoline vehicular emissions decreased, and those of fuel combustion and industrial emissions remained basically unchanged. The above results indicated that with air pollution treatment, the potential for reducing emissions of VOCs in Beijing has decreased. Therefore, regional joint prevention and control are the main ways to control VOC pollution in Beijing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
