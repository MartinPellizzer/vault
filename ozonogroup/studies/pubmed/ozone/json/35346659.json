But rare study examined the effect of air pollution on PTB risk among mothers with previous abortion.", "To estimate the effect of air pollution on PTB and the potential effect modification of previous abortion on such an association in rural part of Henan province (China).", "Based on National Free Preconception Health Examination Project (NFPHEP), information from the medical records of 57,337 mothers with previous abortion were obtained. An inverse distance-weighted model was used to estimate exposure levels of air pollutants. The effect of air pollution on the risk of PTB was estimated with a multiple logistic regression model. Stratified and interaction analyses were undertaken to explore the potential effect modification of previous abortion on this association.", "The risk of PTB was positively associated with exposure to levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>; OR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.02-1.04)], and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>; 1.04; 1.02-1.07), and negatively associated with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure (0.97; 0.97-0.98) during the entire pregnancy. Besides, we observed a positive effect of carbon monoxide (CO) exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy on PTB (1.14; 1.01-1.29). The type of previous abortion could modify the effect of air pollution on the PTB risk (P-<sub>interaction</sub> < 0.05). Compared with mothers with previous induced abortion, mothers with previous spontaneous abortion carried a higher risk of PTB induced by NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub>.", "The risk of PTB was positively associated with levels of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and CO, and negatively associated with the O<sub>3</sub> level. The types of previous abortion could modify the effect of air pollution on PTB. Mothers who had an abortion previously, especially spontaneous abortion, should avoid exposure to air pollution to improve their pregnancy outcome."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
