It has been claimed that in vitamin E deficiency, the arachindonic content of the tissue increases as does the content of higher unsaturated fatty acid. In experimental chronic ozone intoxication, vitamin E was shown to protect against ozone poisoning. There was no evidence however that a rapid turnover of fatty acids occurred during ozone exposure. A possibility is that the increased tissue content of higher polyunsaturated fatty acids is due to the arrest of their further metabolization through lack of vitamin E. The higher polyunsaturated fatty acids are synthesized from linoleic and linolenic acids; in turn, the unsaturated fatty acids with 3 or more double bonds are the basic compounds of prostaglandins. Important functions of prostaglandins include: prevention of blood platelet aggregation; blood vessel dilatation; lowering of blood pressure; stimulation of smooth muscle; and inhibition of fat mobilization by noradrenaline. Diminished activity of one or more of the prostaglandins may be a promoting factor for atherosclerosis and its complication, especially myocardial infarction. These diseases may be prevented by increasing daily consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid which can be derived from vegetable oils."]}], "OtherID": ["000882", "00085664"], "PMID": "4709114", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1973", "Month": "08", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0003-9896", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "27", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1973", "Month": "Jul"}}, "Title": "Archives of environmental health", "ISOAbbreviation": "Arch Environ Health"}, "ArticleTitle": "Ozone, vitamin E, fatty acids, prostaglandins, atherosclerosis and its complications.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "58", "MedlinePgn": "58"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalderup", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1973", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4709114", "10.1080/00039896.1973.10666311"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
