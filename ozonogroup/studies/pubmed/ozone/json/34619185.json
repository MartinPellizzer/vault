A pilot-scale system of anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A/A/O)\u00a0+\u00a0ozonated sludge recycle (OSR) process was operated for 97\u00a0days, to investigate the effects of different ozone concentration (380\u00a0mg/L and 150\u00a0mg/L) on the nutrient removal capacity, sludge reduction rate, the excess sludge properties including settling, dewatering and anaerobic digestion (AD) performance. It was found that at the same total ozone dosage (13\u00a0mg/g MLSS, 25\u00a0mg/g MLVSS), the ozone of 380\u00a0mg/L achieved much higher organic matters and total excess sludge reduction (41.6% and 25.9%) than 150\u00a0mg/L applied (31.0% and 18.2%). It also laid less deterioration effect on the effluent quality and had better nutrient (COD, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, TN) removal capacity than 150\u00a0mg/L applied. Meanwhile, little difference was found in the settling, dewatering and AD properties of excess sludge from the two A/A/O\u00a0+\u00a0OSR processes. Meanwhile, sludge solubilization rate, BIOLOG ECO microplate, 16S rRNA sequencing were applied comprehensively to illustrate the reasons for above advantages of the elevated ozone dosage applied. It was clarified that compared to 150\u00a0mg/L, A/A/O\u00a0+\u00a0OSR with ozone of 380\u00a0mg/L had higher sludge solubilization rate, less impact on bacterial community distribution and utilization capacity of carbon sources in bioreactors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
