The ECBD removal efficiencies of both KMnO<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> and KMnO<sub>4</sub> methods were compared, and the COD and MeOH removal efficiencies with the KMnO<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> process gave better results than the KMnO<sub>4</sub> process. For the ECBD removal efficiencies, the experimental parameters including pH, KMnO<sub>4</sub> dose, O<sub>3</sub> dose and reaction time were optimized by changing one parameter at a time. As a result of 6 h of KMnO<sub>4</sub> oxidation, 91.74% of COD and 95.93% of MeOH removal was achieved under the optimum conditions. However, the COD and MeOH removal efficiencies have been obtained under optimum conditions for KMnO<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> as 97.79% and 98.30%, respectively. The second-order kinetic model has been found to be the most suitable model for both processes and the R<sup>2</sup> has been found as 0.999 and 0.999 for KMnO<sub>4</sub> and KMnO<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The reaction k has also been calculated as 6 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> L\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> and 1.63 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> L\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> for COD and MeOH in KMnO<sub>4</sub> oxidation, respectively. Furthermore, the k has also been calculated as 6 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> L\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> and 1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> L\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup> for COD and MeOH in KMnO<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> oxidation, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Protection Technologies, Sakarya University of Applied Sciences, 54100 Sakarya-Turkey, Turkey E-mail: ptanatti@subu.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Tanatti", "ForeName": "N P\u0131nar", "Initials": "NP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35838280", "10.2166/wst.2022.195"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
