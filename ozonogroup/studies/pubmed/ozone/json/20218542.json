Despite our knowledge of these domes for over a decade, no study has contemplated their effects on air pollution or health. In fact, all air pollution regulations worldwide assume arbitrarily that such domes have no local health impact, and carbon policy proposals, such as \"cap and trade\", implicitly assume that CO(2) impacts are the same regardless of where emissions occur. Here, it is found through data-evaluated numerical modeling with telescoping domains from the globe to the U.S., California, and Los Angeles, that local CO(2) emissions in isolation may increase local ozone and particulate matter. Although health impacts of such changes are uncertain, they are of concern, and it is estimated that that local CO(2) emissions may increase premature mortality by 50-100 and 300-1000/yr in California and the U.S., respectively. As such, reducing locally emitted CO(2) may reduce local air pollution mortality even if CO(2) in adjacent regions is not controlled. If correct, this result contradicts the basis for air pollution regulations worldwide, none of which considers controlling local CO(2) based on its local health impacts. It also suggests that a \"cap and trade\" policy should consider the location of CO(2) emissions, as the underlying assumption of the policy is incorrect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-4020, USA. jacobson@stanford.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacobson", "ForeName": "Mark Z", "Initials": "MZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20218542", "10.1021/es903018m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
