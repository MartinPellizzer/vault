The reaction is initiated by the formation of a van der Waals complex followed by a [4pi + 2pi] cycloaddition between ozone and acetylene (activation enthalpy DeltaH(a)(298) = 9.6 kcal/mol; experiment, 10.2 kcal/mol), yielding 1,2,3-trioxolene, which rapidly opens to alpha-ketocarbonyl oxide 5. Alternatively, an O atom can be transferred from ozone to acetylene (DeltaH(a)(298) = 15.6 kcal/mol), thus leading to formyl carbene, which can rearrange to oxirene or ketene. The key compound in the ozonolysis of acetylene is 5 because it is the starting point for the isomerization to the corresponding dioxirane 19 (DeltaH(a)(298) = 16.9 kcal/mol), for the cyclization to trioxabicyclo[2.1.0]pentane 10 (DeltaH(a)(298) = 19.5 kcal/mol), for the formation of hydroperoxy ketene 15 (DeltaH(a)(298) = 20.6 kcal/mol), and for the rearrangement to dioxetanone 9 (DeltaH(a)(298) = 23.6 kcal/mol). Compounds 19, 10, 15, and 9 rearrange or decompose with barriers between 13 and 16 kcal/mol to yield as major products formanhydride, glyoxal, formaldehyde, formic acid, and (to a minor extent) glyoxylic acid. Hence, the ozonolysis of acetylene possesses a very complicated reaction mechanism that deserves intensive experimental studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Theoretical Chemistry, G\u00f6teborg University, Reutersgatan 2, S-41320 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cremer", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crehuet", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anglada", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11414847", "10.1021/ja010166f", "ja010166f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
