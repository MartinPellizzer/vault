Pearson product-moment correlation analysis showed that with increase of ozone level in copying sites and duration of exposure to ozone, the values of LPO in plasma and erythrocytes in the bodies of operators were gradually increased,while those of VC, VE, beta-CAR, SOD, CAT and GPX were decreased in the same manner. Odds ratio (OR) of risk of biochemical parameters reflecting potential oxidative damage of the copying operators ranged from 4.440 to 13.516, and 95% CI of OR was from 2.113 to 34.061.
