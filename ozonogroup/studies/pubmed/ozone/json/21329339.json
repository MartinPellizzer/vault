Kinetic data are obtained through time-resolved observation of the appearance of atomic bromine that is formed by rapid unimolecular decomposition of radicals generated via abstraction of a \u03b2-hydrogen atom. The following Arrhenius expressions are excellent representations of the temperature dependence of rate coefficients measured for the reactions Cl + CH(3)CH(2)Br (eq 1 ) and Cl + CH(3)CH(2)CH(2)Br (eq 2 ) over the temperature range 221-436 K (units are 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)): k(1)(T) = 3.73\u2009exp(-378/T) and k(2)(T) = 5.14\u2009exp(+21/T). The accuracy (2\u03c3) of rate coefficients obtained from the above expressions is estimated to be \u00b115% for k(2)(T) and +15/-25% for k(1)(T) independent of T. For the relatively slow reaction Cl + CH(2)BrCH(2)Br (eq 3 ), a nonlinear ln k(3) vs 1/T dependence is observed and contributions to observed kinetics from impurity reactions cannot be ruled out; the following modified Arrhenius expression represents the temperature dependence (244-569 K) of upper-limit rate coefficients that are consistent with the data: k(3)(T) \u2264 3.2 \u00d7 10(-17)T(2)\u2009exp(-184/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). Comparison of Br fluorescence signal strengths obtained when Cl removal is dominated by reaction with R-Br with those obtained when Cl removal is dominated by reaction with Br(2) (unit yield calibration) allows branching ratios for \u03b2-hydrogen abstraction (k(ia)/k(i), i = 1,2) to be evaluated. The following Arrhenius-type expressions are excellent representations of the observed temperature dependences: k(1a)/k(1) = 0.85\u2009exp(-230/T) and k(2a)/k(2) = 0.40 exp(+181/T). The accuracy (2\u03c3) of branching ratios obtained from the above expressions is estimated to be \u00b135% for reaction 1 and \u00b125% for reaction 2 independent of T. It appears likely that reactions 1 and 2 play a significant role in limiting the tropospheric lifetime and, therefore, the ODP of CH(3)CH(2)Br and CH(3)CH(2)CH(2)Br, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0340, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laine", "ForeName": "Patrick L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nicovich", "ForeName": "J Michael", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wine", "ForeName": "Paul H", "Initials": "PH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21329339", "10.1021/jp110798q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
