Less is known about the functions of osmoprotectants in scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated at different sites depending on leaf age. This study aimed to clarify the osmotic adjustments adopted by old and young leaves of Oxford and I-214 poplar clones [differing in ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) sensitivity] to cope with three levels of O<sub>3</sub> [ambient (AA), and two elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels]. In both clones, the impact of intermediate O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA) on ROS production appeared to be leaf age-specific, given the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) observed only in old leaves of the Oxford plants and in young leaves of the I-214 ones (2- fold higher than AA and +79%, respectively). The induction of an oxidative burst was associated with membrane injury, indicating an inadequate response of the antioxidative systems [decrease of lutein and \u03b2-carotene (-37 and -85% in the old leaves of the Oxford plants), accumulation of proline and tocopherols (+60 and +12% in the young leaves of the I-214 ones)]. Intermediate O<sub>3</sub> concentrations reacted with unsaturated lipids of the plasma membrane in old and young leaves of the Oxford plants, leading to an increase of malondialdehyde by-products (more than 2- fold higher than AA), while no effect was recorded for I-214. The impact of the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA) on ROS production did not appear clone-specific, which may react with cell wall components by leading to oxidative pressure. Outcomes demonstrated the ability of young leaves of I-214 plants in contain O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
