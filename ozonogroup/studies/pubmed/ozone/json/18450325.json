The soil was assumed to be free of soil organic matter. The model included a set of transient equations considering diffusion with simultaneous chemical reaction and hydrophobic partitioning. From dimensionless analysis, it was found that the film concentrations of ozone and the hydrophobic organic component were dependent on the Damk\u00f6hler numbers. Effects of Damk\u00f6hler numbers on the film profiles of components were examined. With the interfacial flux of ozone calculated from film profiles, dimensionless governing equations of ozone transport and contaminant removal across an experimental column were established. These equations were dependent on the Stanton number. One-dimensional column experiments were conducted to test the model. The optimal time for flow rate adjustment during the process was approximated. Finally, effects of ozone velocity and ozone gas concentration on the Stanton number were evaluated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Science, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 717, Taiwan. mhsung@mail.chna.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sung", "ForeName": "Menghau", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Suen Zone", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Contam Hydrol", "NlmUniqueID": "8805644", "ISSNLinking": "0169-7722"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D9BSU0SE4T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentachlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pentachlorophenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18450325", "10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.02.005", "S0169-7722(08)00023-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
