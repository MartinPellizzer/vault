They are produced by various sources such as internal combustion engines, wood and biomass burning, and fuel and natural gas combustion, and their origin, among other parameters, determines their intrinsic toxicity for reasons that are not yet fully understood. Many constituents of the nanoparticles are considered toxic or at least hazardous, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metal compounds, in addition to gaseous pollutants present in the aerosol fraction, such as NOx, SO<sub>2,</sub> and ozone. All these compounds can cause oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, inflammation in the lungs and other tissues, and cellular organelles. Epidemiological investigations concluded that airborne pollution may affect the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Moreover, particulate matter has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, a carcinogenic effect not related to DNA damage, but to the cellular inflammatory response to the pollutants, in which the release of cytokines promotes the proliferation of pre-existing mutated cancer cells. The mechanisms behind toxicity can be investigated experimentally using cell cultures or animal models. Methods for gathering particulate matter have been explored, but standardized protocols are needed to ensure that the samples accurately represent chemical mixtures in the environment. Toxic constituents of nanoparticles can be studied in animal and cellular models, but designing realistic exposure settings is challenging. The air-liquid interface (ALI) system directly exposes cells, mimicking particle inhalation into the lungs. Continuous research and monitoring of nanoparticles and other airborne pollutants is essential for understanding their effects and developing active strategies to mitigate their risks to human and environmental health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
