Reactive Red 45 in water solution. Influence of pH and hydrogen peroxide dosage on process efficiency was investigated. The rate of color removal was studied by measuring the absorbance at the characteristic wavelength while mineralization rates were obtained on the basis of total organic carbon (TOC) and adsorbable organic halides (AOX) measurements. Complete bleaching was achieved by all applied processes after 60 min while the maximal mineralization extent depended on the reaction conditions for each of the processes. It has been found that UV/H2O2/O3 process was the most efficient with 61.1% TOC removal and 72.0% AOX removal, respectively, achieved after a 1-h treatment. Time required for complete mineralization of RR45 by UV/H2O2 and UV/H2O2/O3 processes was determined as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology, University of Zagreb, Marulicev trg 19, Zagreb 10000, Croatia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peternel", "ForeName": "Igor", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koprivanac", "ForeName": "Natalija", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kusic", "ForeName": "Hrvoje", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16386775", "10.1016/j.watres.2005.11.029", "S0043-1354(05)00674-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
