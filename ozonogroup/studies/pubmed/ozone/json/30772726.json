Covering the surface of the soil with a plastic tarpaulin or 'barrier film' when using a soil fumigant is typically used to retain fumigants in the soil and to reduce emissions. Emission levels depend on the film's permeability, which varies mainly according to the film's material, the type of fumigant and the environmental conditions. We used specialized laboratory equipment to test the permeability of four films to DMDS under similar temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions present in the field: polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH). This report presents evidence that the influence of temperature and relative humidity on the permeability of four films to the fumigant DMDS: PE\uff0cPVC,PVDC, EVOH. This research confirmed that PE and PVC films are relatively permeable to DMDS and PVC was more unstable to a range of environmental condition than other three films; PVDC and EVOH films are relatively impermeable to the fumigant DMDS and the permeability of PVDC was more stable to a range of environmental conditions than EVOH. The cumulative emissions of DMDS from soil covered with PE, PVC, PVDC or EVOH were 21.38%, 27.51%, 1.59% and 1.52%, respectively. As the permeability of PVDC was more stable to a range of environmental conditions than EVOH, PVDC shows potential for use in the field with a volatile fumigant such as DMDS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
