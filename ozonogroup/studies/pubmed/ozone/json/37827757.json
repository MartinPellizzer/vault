Meteorological conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, have a great influence on ozone formation. Therefore, understanding and quantifying the impact of the variation in temperature and humidity on ozone level can effectively provide the theoretical basis for the government to prevent and control ozone pollution. By analyzing the relationship among the daily maximum temperature (<i>T</i><sub>max</sub>), relative humidity (RH), and the maximum 8-h running average ozone (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) measured from January 1, 2015 to July 31, 2022, a linear positive correlation between O<sub>3</sub>-8h and <i>T</i><sub>max</sub> was observed in the seven regions with serious ozone pollution, and the temperature penalty factor ranged from 2.1-6.0 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7\u2103)<sup>-1</sup>; a nonlinear correlation between O<sub>3</sub>-8h and RH was also observed, and O<sub>3</sub>-8h was the highest when RH was 55%. The sensitivity of different regions to <i>T</i><sub>max</sub> and RH was slightly different; generally, the most suitable meteorological conditions for ozone formation were 29\u2103 \u2264 <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>< 38\u2103 and 40% \u2264 RH<70%. In the Yangtze River Delta, Jiangsu-Anhui-Shandong-Henan, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, under extreme high temperature conditions (<i>T</i><sub>max</sub> \u2265 35\u2103), O<sub>3</sub>-8h stopped increasing with the increase in temperature and even dropped; simultaneously, it was often accompanied with a small increase in particulate matter. It may be related to the heterogeneous reaction of some precursors with higher water vapor content and the increase in ozone heterogeneous sink."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Intelligent Environmental Science and Technology Co.
