The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared catalysts were evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light irradiation. Compared with untreated g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, the ozone-treated g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (OCN) exhibited almost 5 times higher photodegradation activity and 2 times H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate. The enhanced photocatalysis capability could be assigned to a narrowed band gap (2.62eV), the increased defects and active sites, and the reduced recombination efficiency of photoinduced carriers in OCN. Furthermore, the photocatalytic mechanism in degradation process of MB was discussed and the hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical have proven to be the predominant active species. It is reasonable to believe that chemical modifying of catalysts through ozone treatment could efficiently regulate its catalytic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
