However, the presence of the structural \"dead volume\" and pore-size-induced diffusion-reaction trade-off limitation restricts the functioning of the SSA. Here, we reported an effective approach to make the best SSA by changing the traditional 3D spherule catalyst into a 2D-like form and creating an in situ micro-nanolinked structure. Thus, a 2D-like catalyst was obtained which was characterized by a mini \"paddy field\" surface, and it exhibited a sharply decreased dead volume, a highly available SSA and oriented flexibility. Given its paddy-field-like mass-transfer routine, the organic capture capability was 7.5-fold higher than that of the catalyst with mesopores only. Moreover, such a catalyst exhibited a record-high O<sub>3</sub>-to-\u00b7OH transition rate of 2.86 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup> compared with reported millimetric catalysts (metal base), which contributed to a 6.12-fold higher total organic removal per catalyst mass than traditional 3D catalysts. The facile scale preparation, performance stability, and significant material savings with the 2D-like catalyst were also beneficial for practical applications. Our findings provide a unique and general approach for designing potential catalysts with excellent performance in water purification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province for Chemical Pollution Control and Resources Reuse, School of Environmental and Biological Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing 210094, P.R.
