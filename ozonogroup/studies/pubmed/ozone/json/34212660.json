Recently, the control and elimination of pDOM have been a growing concern during drinking water treatment processes. In this study, a high-performance size exclusion chromatography system coupled with photo-diode array, fluorescence detector, and online organic carbon detector (HPSEC-PDA/FLD/OCD) was used to determine the removal behaviors of different-sized pDOM from two full-scale drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Coagulation and activated carbon adsorption were selected for bench-scale experiments to further assess the removal behavior of pDOM during conventional water treatment processes. The results showed that different-sized pDOM fractions exhibited different removal characteristics. Pre-oxidation can effectively remove some tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like components with high MW, and as the oxidization effect was enhanced, more high MW fractions decomposed into low MW ones. Conversely, some aliphatic pDOM fractions in high MW (e.g., aliphatic proteins) were not subject to pre-oxidation removal. The coagulation-sedimentation unit was efficient in removing high MW fractions, specifically tryptophan-like fractions. Additionally, some pDOM components may be released during coagulation. pDOM with low MW and high hydrophobicity were easily removed during activated carbon filtration. However, long-term operation of the activated carbon filter may breed microorganisms, resulting in the partial release of pDOM fractions. Moreover, UV disinfection processes promoted the degradation of low MW pDOM components. Due to the complex water quality and uncontrollable microbial activities, the aforementioned water treatment units did not exhibit a synergistic effect on pDOM removal. In comparison with humic-like substances, pDOM was susceptible to water quality changes, and its removal was limited in the surveyed DWTPs. Therefore, DWTPs must strengthen pDOM monitoring in influent and effluent and adjust the operating parameters of different treatment units in a timely manner. Moreover, the combination of advanced water treatment processes, such as ozone-biological activated carbon process and nanofiltration, should also be considered to strictly control pDOM component removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Meng-Ya", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yu-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technology Institute of Beijing Waterworks Group Co., Ltd., Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lan", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hai-Ou", "Initials": "HO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34212660", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202010204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
