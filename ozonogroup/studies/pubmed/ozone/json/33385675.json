Phenolic pollutants with different hydroxyl position (catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, phenol) were preferentially and efficiently oxidized in photocatalytic process (PC) by designing boron-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> (B-TiO<sub>2</sub>).The key role for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of B-TiO<sub>2</sub> was the formation of abundant Ti<sup>3+</sup> species. The formation of Ti<sup>3+</sup>-O weakened the competitive adsorption of H<sub>2</sub>O in aqueous solution and favored the formation of cooperative hydrogen bond on the surface of B-TiO<sub>2</sub>, leading to enhanced adsorption of phenolic pollutants. The degradation rate constant of B-TiO<sub>2</sub> (k<sub>B-TiO2</sub>) was regardless of the corresponding oxidation potential of phenolic pollutants. The k<sub>B-TiO2</sub> for catechol in photocatalytic process was as high as 3.46 min<sup>-1</sup>, which was 18.2, 1.6 times higher than that of biodegradation and ozonation methods, respectively. Of note, the preferential removal mechanism of phenolic pollutants was elucidated by in-situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-IR and density functional theory calculation (DFT). The results were helpful for developing new preferential oxidation technologies in HO\u2219-mediated process for selectively removing low concentration but highly toxic pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
