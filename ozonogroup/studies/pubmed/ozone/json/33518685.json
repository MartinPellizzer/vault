When a surface-roughened, pure titanium disk was immersed in a calcium chloride solution (100 mM) containing 20 ppm ozone for 24 h at 25\u00baC, calcium was detected on the surface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The calcium-modified, roughened titanium disk had a significantly greater concentration of the initially adhered cells as well as cells cultured over 7 days compared with titanium disks without surface modification. Furthermore, the initial bacterial adhesion on the calcium-ozone treated titanium disk was statistically less than on a pure titanium disk or titanium disk treated without ozone. Dissolved ozone was useful for modifying the surface of roughened titanium with calcium ions and the surface modification may be applicable for dental implants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Program of Dentistry, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Takechi", "ForeName": "Masaaki", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, Shinshu University Hospital."}], "LastName": "Takamoto", "ForeName": "Megumi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Program of Dentistry, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Ninomiya", "ForeName": "Yoshiaki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Program of Dentistry, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "Shigehiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Program of Dentistry, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Mizuta", "ForeName": "Kuniko", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Program of Dentistry, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Nakagawa", "ForeName": "Takayuki", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Oral Health, Program of Oral Health Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Shigeishi", "ForeName": "Hideo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Oral Health, Program of Oral Health Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University."}], "LastName": "Ohta", "ForeName": "Kouji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University."}], "LastName": "Ishikawa", "ForeName": "Kunio", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials, Faculty of Dental Science, Kyushu University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Bioengineering, Department of Dental Engineering, Fukuoka Dental College."}], "LastName": "Tsuru", "ForeName": "Kanji", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Dent Mater J", "NlmUniqueID": "8309299", "ISSNLinking": "0287-4547"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Implants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Implants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "50"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33518685", "10.4012/dmj.2020-224"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
