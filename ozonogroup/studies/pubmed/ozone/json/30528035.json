Ozonation and ultrafiltration (UF) are powerful technologies reported to eliminate EDCs. Due to the importance of effluent organic matters (EfOMs) in secondary effluent, the effects of three kinds of EfOM on the treatment of five EDCs using ozonation and UF were investigated. The three kinds of EfOM studied were humic acid sodium salt (NaAH), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate (NaAg); and the five EDCs were estrone, 17\u03b2-estradiol, estriol, 17\u03b1-ethynyl estradiol and bisphenol A. The results showed that EfOM accelerated the decay rate of ozone and inhibited the degradation efficiency of EDCs by ozonation in the order NaAH>BSA>NaAg. The ultraviolet absorbance at 280nm (UVA<sub>280</sub>) has potential for use as a surrogate indicator to assess EDC removal via ozonation without conducting difficult EDC analyses. When the decline in UVA<sub>280</sub> exceeded 18%, the five EDCs had been completely removed. The UF behavior of NaAH, BSA and NaAg was found to follow the cake filtration law. The fouling potential of EfOM followed the order NaAg>NaAH>BSA; while EfOM on the membrane surface enhanced EDC removal in the order NaAH>BSA>NaAg. The mean retention rate of the membrane was increased by 24%, 10% and 8%, respectively. The properties of EDCs and EfOM cakes both influenced the EDC removal rates due to adsorption, size exclusion and charge attraction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
