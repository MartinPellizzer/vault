The annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations decreased by 10.9%, 13.2%, 9.3%, 10.1%, 9.4%, and 5.5% from 2019 to 2020. National average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in 2020 met the standard of 35\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and that of O<sub>3</sub> decreased from 2019. COVID-19 lockdown affected NO<sub>2</sub> level dramatically, yet influences on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were less clear-cut. Positive correlations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were found, even in winter in all five key regions, e.g., Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ), FenWei Plain (FWP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Chengdu-Chongqing Region (CCR), indicating importance of secondary production for both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Large seasonal variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-SO<sub>2</sub> correlation indicates a varying role of SO<sub>2</sub> to PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in different seasons; and generally weak correlations in winter between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> or SO<sub>2</sub> reveal the complexity of secondary formation processes to PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in winter. Multilinear regression analysis between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO demonstrates that PM<sub>2.5</sub> is more sensitive to the change of NO<sub>2</sub> than SO<sub>2</sub> in JJJ, FWP, PRD and CCR, suggesting a priority of NO<sub>x</sub> emission control for future PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction. Furthermore, the new World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (WHO AQG2021) were adopted to calculate the excess health risks (ER) as well as the health-risk based air quality index (HAQI<sub>WHO</sub>) of the pollutants. Such assessment points out the severity of air pollution associated health risks under strict standards: 40.0% of days had HAQI<sub>WHO</sub>>100, while only 14.4% days had AQI>100. PM<sub>2.5</sub>\u00a0ER was generally larger than O<sub>3</sub> ER, but O<sub>3</sub> ER in low PM<sub>2.5</sub> region (PRD) and during summer became more serious. Notably, NO<sub>2</sub> ER became even more important than PM<sub>2.5</sub> due to its strict limit of WHO AQG2021. Overall, our results highlight the increasing importance of O<sub>3</sub> in both air quality evaluation and health risk assessment, and the importance of coordinated mitigation of multiple pollutants (mainly PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) in protecting the public health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
