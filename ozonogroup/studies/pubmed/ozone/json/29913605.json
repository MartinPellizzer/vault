To this end, we investigated the relationship between photosynthetic traits and leaf nitrogen content in various canopy positions of two tree species under free-air O<sub>3</sub> exposure (60\u202fnmol\u202fmol<sup>-1</sup>, during daylight hours) in June, August, and October 2012. We observed O<sub>3</sub>-induced reduction in V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> without reduction of leaf nitrogen content in both tree species. In Siebold's beech, V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> in leaves with higher N<sub>area</sub> were largely decreased by O<sub>3</sub> from August, while little effect of O<sub>3</sub> was observed in leaves with lower N<sub>area</sub>. On the other hand, there was no difference in the extent of O<sub>3</sub>-induced reduction in V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> across the range of N<sub>area</sub> in leaves of Japanese oak. Reduction of leaf nitrogen content under elevated O<sub>3</sub> conditions was observed only in Siebold's beech in October. These results indicated that the decrease in the efficiency of photosynthetic nitrogen use is in an earlier step in O<sub>3</sub>-induced decline of photosynthesis in Siebold's beech and Japanese oak. Based on these results, we emphasize the importance of integration of O<sub>3</sub> effects into the conventional estimation of V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> from leaf nitrogen content for evaluating canopy photosynthesis under current and future elevated O<sub>3</sub> conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
