Here, we synthesized a new fluorescent perylene bisimide (PBI)-cored metallacycle complex through coordination-driven self-assembly and used it for the production of a fluorescent film sensor. The unique rectangular structure of the developed fluorophore endows the sensor with enhanced sensing performance and discriminability to <i>n</i>-alkanes (C<sub>5-10</sub>). Specifically, the experimental detection limits for <i>n</i>-pentane, <i>n</i>-hexane, and <i>n</i>-decane are 39, 7, and 1.4 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, and the corresponding linear ranges are from 39 to 2546, 7 to 1745, and 1.4 to 85 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Moreover, the sensing is fully reversible. In tandem with a gas chromatographic separation system, the film sensor showed comparable detection ability for the <i>n</i>-alkanes with a commercial flame ionization detector (FID), while the film sensor needs no hydrogen; it occupies a much smaller size (30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 44 mm<sup>3</sup>) and consumes less energy (0.215 W). Further studies demonstrated that the developed sensor can be used for on-site and real-time quantification of NHMCs, laying the foundation for developing into a portable detector."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Simin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Xingmao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhaolong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Nannan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wenjun", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhongshan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8490-8080"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "perylene bisimide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5QD5427UN7", "NameOfSubstance": "Perylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flame Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Imides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Perylene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34806871", "10.1021/acs.analchem.1c03641"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
