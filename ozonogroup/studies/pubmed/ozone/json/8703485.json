Despite much research, the effects of ozone on humans and potential cellular mechanisms of injury are still uncertain. However, ozone has been reported to increase the formation of aldehydes that could react with cellular proteins. Therefore, the purpose of these studies was to determine whether 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a previously unidentified aldehyde product of ozone exposure, is formed in human subjects exposed to ozone, and whether the response of human alveolar macrophages (AM) following a 1-h exposure to 0.25 ppm ozone with moderate exercise could be mimicked by in vitro incubation of AM with HNE. Western analysis demonstrated increased HNE protein adducts in airway fluid and alveolar macrophages after ozone exposure. AM were examined for endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS])-stimulated interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) release and expression of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72). Immediately after ozone exposure there was no change in HSP72, but a 5-fold increase occurred 4 h after exposure. By 18 h after exposure, HSP72 levels decreased to below comparable air-exposed levels. Immediately after ozone exposure there was no effect on IL-1 beta release stimulated by LPS. However, IL-1 beta release stimulated by LPS was significantly inhibited 4 h after ozone exposure. By 18 h after ozone exposure, IL-1 beta release stimulated by LPS returned to normal. Incubation of human AM in vitro with HNE induced HSP72 and blocked LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta release possibly by inhibiting interleukin converting enzyme. Consequently, the in vitro results and demonstration of HNE protein adducts following ozone exposure are consistent with HNE being involved in this process in vivo and suggest that the cellular toxic effects of ozone could be a result of thiol reactive aldehydes produced by ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77030, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamilton", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hazbun", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jumper", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eschenbacher", "ForeName": "W L", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holian", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "M01-RR-02558", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cross-Linking Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K1CVM13F96", "NameOfSubstance": "4-hydroxy-2-nonenal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Linking Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8703485", "10.1165/ajrcmb.15.2.8703485"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
