However, the secondary air pollutant of ozone is produced to possibly cause potential risk. In this work, six kinds of two-stage ESPs containing various charger and collector units, whose structure and size design are determined according to the indoor application, are developed to investigate the comprehensive control of PM 2.5 capture and ozone emission. Responsive surface methodology is employed to explore the relationship among ozone concentration, wire number, charger current and airflow velocity, and obtain regression model for predicting ozone emission. The comprehensive evaluation standard considering efficiency-ozone double factors is proposed to optimize structure design and working conditions of two-stage ESPs. Experimental results show that two-stage ESPs with a unit ratio of >3/4 can keep relatively good stable state, whose current reduction is in around 10 \u03bcA, for preventing particle charging function of charger from basically affecting. For the two-stage ESP with Ra = 2/5, it finds the optimization of working conditions of collector can bring rapid improvement of collection efficiency for 0.25 \u03bcm particles, which reaches up to be >60 %, while the optimization of that of the charger can only result in an enhancement of <30 %. RSM analysis exhibits a strong connection between the interactive effect of charger current and airflow velocity for presenting a steep response surface. Based on comprehensive control of PM 2.5 and ozone pollutants, it suggests the two-stage ESP with Ra = 2/5 is selected at the first priority and then that with Ra = 1/6, while two-stage ESP with Ra = 4/3 is not recommended for unsatisfied consequence of both of PM 2.5 capture and ozone emission."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
