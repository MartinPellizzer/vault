Worker exposure to high MB concentrations during fumigation has been previously reported. However, variations in MB concentration as a function of distance from fumigated objects or of time after degassing have not been reported so far. In this study, air samples were collected at various distances from fumigated objects (oranges, wood in containers, and wood in tarpaulin) during injection and degassing and analyzed via gas chromatography according to the Occupational Safety and Health Agency method. In addition, MB concentrations were directly measured over time using a gas detector during degassing. Non-linear regression analysis of the logarithmically transformed data indicated a clear decrease in MB concentration with distance as well as time. Non-linear regression models were constructed to describe the decrease in MB concentration with distance from the objects and with time during degassing (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for all models). The results of this study could aid in establishing appropriate safety guidelines, and hence, in preventing risks related to MB exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Quarantine, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA), Gimcheon, 39660, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agriculture and Life Science (BK21+ Program), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Min-Goo", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Dong-A University, Busan, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heavy Metal Exposure Environmental Health Center, Dong-A University, Busan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Young-Seoub", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agriculture and Life Science (BK21+ Program), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Chung Gyoo", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Medical Graduate School, Pusan National University, Busan, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gugil Environment and Industrial Hygiene.
