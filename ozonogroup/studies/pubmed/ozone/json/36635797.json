In order to investigate the causes of O<sub>3</sub> pollution, an online observation of 116 VOCs with a time resolution of 1 h was carried out in Liucheng county from October 1<sup>st</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup>, and the sensitivity of ozone to the relative changes in the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs was analyzed. The results showed that the average value of <i>\u03c6</i>\uff3btotal volatile organic compounds (TVOCs)\uff3d during the observation period was 27.52\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and the average value of <i>\u03c6</i>(TVOCs) during the polluting process (October 1<sup>st</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup>) was 32.15\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, which was 32.79% higher than that of the non-pollution process (October 8<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup>). In terms of species concentration, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) contributed the highest, accounting for 43.70%, followed by alkanes (23.00%), aromatics (11.75%), and halocarbons (7.35%). In terms of ozone formation potential (OFP), OVOCs contributed the highest (41.96%) to OFP, followed by aromatics (32.60%) and alkenes (17.92%). During the observation period, VOCs mainly came from motor vehicle emissions (32.44%), biomass combustion sources (29.31%), solvent use sources (16.43%), plant sources (11.34%), and chemical industry emissions (10.49%). The contribution ratios of solvent use sources and plant sources in the pollution process increased by 28.58% and 28.53%, respectively. The EKMA curve shows that, during the observation period, Liucheng county was in a synergistic control area for VOCs and nitric oxide (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>). Therefore, in the high ozone-occurrence autumn of Liucheng county, the key will be to reduce both VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Mo", "ForeName": "Zhao-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Protection, Guangxi Eco-engineering Vocational & Technical College, Liuzhou 545004, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qin-Qin", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jia-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Jing-Ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Shao-Li", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Nanning 530022, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hui-Lin", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Liuzhou Bureau of Ecology and Environment, Liuzhou 545001, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36635797", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202202207"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
