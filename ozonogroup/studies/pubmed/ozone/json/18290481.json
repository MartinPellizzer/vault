The catalytic mechanism was deduced through the effect of radical inhibitor t-BuOH on the reaction. Furthermore, affecting factors of catalytic activity were investigated. Results show that zinc hydroxide has excellent property of catalytic ozonation. Compared to ozonation alone, the catalytic removal rate of pCNB dissolved in distilled water increases by 51.3 percents at reacting time of 20 min. The catalysis, which is influenced by density of hydroxyl groups combined on the surface of hydroxide, follows a hydroxyl radical reaction pathway. The removal gets better with increasing dosage of catalyst. Zinc hydroxide was used for 3 times without obvious changes of pCNB removal rate. Bicarbonate in water and phosphate in buffer solution could greatly depress its catalytic activity. The optimal catalysis is achieved at solution pH = 7."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zhonglinchen@hit.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-Lin", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhen-Zhen", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Miao-Miao", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xin-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CVL66U249D", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chloronitrobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OXK3V8KJ7L", "NameOfSubstance": "zinc hydroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18290481"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
