However, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution was found to steadily deteriorate in most part of eastern China, especially in developed regions such as Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ), Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) and Pearl River Delta region (PRD). To shed more light on current O<sub>3</sub> pollution and its responses to precursor emissions, we integrate satellite retrievals, ground-based measurements together with regional numerical simulation in this study. It is indicated by multiple sets of observational data that NO<sub>x</sub> in eastern China has declined more than 25% from 2012 to 2016. Based on chemical transport modeling, we find that O<sub>3</sub> formation in eastern China has changed from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sensitive regime to the mixed sensitive regime due to NO<sub>x</sub> reductions, substantially contributing to the recent increasing trend in urban O<sub>3</sub>. In addition, such transitions tend to bring about an ~1-1.5\u202fh earlier peak of net O<sub>3</sub> formation rate. We further studied the O<sub>3</sub> precursors relationships by conducting tens of sensitivity simulations to explore potential ways for effective O<sub>3</sub> mitigation. It is suggested that the past control measures that only focused on NO<sub>x</sub> may not work or even aggravate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the city clusters. In practice, O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the three regions is expected to be effectively mitigated only when the reduction ratio of VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> is greater than 2:1, indicating VOCs-targeted control is a more practical and feasible way."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
