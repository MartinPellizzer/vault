Bangor) with chlorinated and ozonated water, respectively, as well as the storage of the produce under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, on PAL activity and synthesis of phenolic compounds have been evaluated on pilot plant scale. Inherent raw material inhomogeneity was compensated by pooling large sized samples, and frequent sampling ensured significant data. PAL activity was induced by processing and linearly increased throughout storage under aerobic conditions, whereas an anaerobic atmosphere resulted in a maximum activity peak at storage day 2-4. The accumulation of phenolic compounds showed good correlation with the kinetics of PAL activity. Although the influence of the washing treatments was weak, the use of chlorinated water for washing shredded carrots slightly delayed the onset of PAL activity. The phenolic content of the minimally processed carrots was dominated by trans and cis isomers of chlorogenic acid ( approximately 95%). Additionally, the occurrence of p-coumaroylquinic acid ( approximately 5%) and the novel finding of three dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers were reported. The synthesis of phenolic compounds was controlled, depending on storage atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Technology, Section Plant Foodstuff Technology, Hohenheim University, August-von-Hartmann-Strasse 3, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klaiber", "ForeName": "Ralph G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baur", "ForeName": "Sascha", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koblo", "ForeName": "Arjuna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carle", "ForeName": "Reinhold", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15713021", "10.1021/jf049084b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
