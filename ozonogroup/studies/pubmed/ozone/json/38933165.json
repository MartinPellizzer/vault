The Antarctic ozone hole located 10 to 20\u00a0km above sea level, also affects the circulation of the atmosphere in the southern hemisphere, which in turn affects the global climate. One of its most noticeable effects is that the westerly jet in summer begins to move to the poles. The westerly jet is a planetary-scale atmospheric circulation phenomenon; there are several jet zones on the Earth. The 1987 Montreal Protocol and its subsequent amendments banned the production and use of ozone-depleting substances. Therefore, the concentration of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere is declining, and the ozone layer has shown preliminary signs of recovery. The study by Banerjee et\u00a0al. pointed out that ozone hole-related effects on circulation and climate have ceased since the ozone layer began to recover [1]. While others had noticed this trend of cessation of ozone hole effects before, Banerjee and others officially attributed it to the impact of the Montreal Protocol for the first time."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Authors.
