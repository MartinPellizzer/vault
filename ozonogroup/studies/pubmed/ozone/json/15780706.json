This is surprising because drinking water would provide a direct route into the body for any drugs that might be present. Although many countries employ advanced treatments, such as granular activated carbon, membrane technologies, ozonation and ultraviolet radiation, for treating water intended for human consumption, some compounds have been shown to be unaffected by such processes. Here, we examine the levels of drug substances reported in drinking water around the world. The possible implications of the presence of these compounds are highlighted and assessed, and recommendations are made for further research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Technology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Imperial College, London, SW7 2BP, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Oliver A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lester", "ForeName": "John N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Voulvoulis", "ForeName": "Nick", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Trends Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8310903", "ISSNLinking": "0167-7799"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}], "NumberOfReferences": "50"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15780706", "10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.02.001", "S0167-7799(05)00047-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
