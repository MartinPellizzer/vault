To clarify the mechanism by which BAC affects effluent water quality, the processes of a drinking water plant in Jiangsu Province were investigated. It was found that during the O<sub>3</sub>-BAC process, although ozonation could remove dissolved organic matter (DOC) to a certain extent, the DOC increased from 4.44 to 4.47\u00a0mg/L after BAC. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in effluent from different processes was divided into five fractions based on hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity by resin fractionation. Through fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy combined with DOC analysis, it was found that SMPs are mainly included in transitional hydrophilic neutral (TPIN) fraction, which was the main cause of the DOC increase. Therefore, a new combined process was designed to remove TPIN effectively by coagulation after biological treatment, and found that coagulation had a good removal rate (13.2%) on TPIN. The trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of TPIN could be reduced effectively by 44.9% after coagulation. Compared with the old process, the new combined process had a higher removal rate (14.2-30.0%) of DOC, as well as a greater reduction of THMFP (29.0-78.6%) and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP) (46.4-75.3%). This study aims to reveal the mechanism by which SMPs affect effluent water quality and exacerbate health risks, and to propose a solution to provide theoretical support for the design and optimization of drinking water treatment processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
