Natural and plasma treated (PTNL/N<sub>2</sub>) limonite samples were characterized by FESEM, XPS, XRD, FTIR, AAS, EDX, BET/BJH and pH<sub>pzc</sub> to confirm the successful synthesis. Central composite design (CCD) and artificial neural network (ANN, topology of 4:8:1) methods were utilized to study the oxidation/mineralization of phenazopyridine (PhP) as a hazardous contaminant by heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process (HCOP). The obtained results indicated that PTNL/N<sub>2</sub> had the highest catalytic performance in PhP degradation (98.6% in 40\u00a0min) and mineralization (80.4% in 120\u00a0min). The degradation mechanism in different processes was investigated by dissolved ozone concentration, various organic scavengers (BQ and TBA) and inorganic salts (NaNO<sub>3</sub>, NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). Moreover, reusability-stability, Fe and nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) ions release were assessed during different AOPs. Furthermore, toxicity tests indicated that the HCOP using PTNL/N<sub>2</sub> was able to detoxify the PhP solutions efficiently. Finally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies were employed to introduce the most plausible contaminant degradation pathway, reactive sites and byproducts. This research provided a new insight into the improvement of wastewater treatment studies by a combination of experiment and computer simulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
