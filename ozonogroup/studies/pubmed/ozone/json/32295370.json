Concise final formulas are derived for the construction of the Hamiltonian matrix using an efficient combination of the variational basis representation and discrete variable representation methods with locally optimized basis sets and grids. First, the new code is tested by comparing its results with those of the APH3D program of Kendrick et al. [Kendrick, Pack, Walker, and Hayes, J. Chem. Phys. 110, 6673 (1999)]. Then, accurate calculations of the rovibrational spectra are carried out for doubly substituted symmetric (<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O) and asymmetric (<sup>18</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O) ozone isotopomers for the total angular momentum up to J = 5. Together with similar data recently reported for the singly substituted symmetric (<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O) and asymmetric (<sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O) ozone isotopomers, these calculations quantify the role of the Coriolis coupling effect in the large mass-independent isotopic enrichment of ozone, observed in both laboratory experiments and the atmosphere of the Earth. It is found that the Coriolis effect in ozone is relatively small, as evidenced by deviations of its rotational constants from the symmetric-top-rotor behavior, magnitudes of parity splittings (\u039b-doubling), and ratios of rovibrational partition functions for asymmetric vs symmetric ozone molecules. It is concluded that all of these characteristics are influenced by the isotopic masses as much as they are influenced by the overall symmetry of the molecule. It is therefore unlikely that the Coriolis coupling effect could be responsible for symmetry-driven mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000000239503356"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Wehr Chemistry Building, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881, USA."}], "LastName": "Gayday", "ForeName": "Igor", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000260941430"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Theoretical Division (T-1, MS B221), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA."}], "LastName": "Teplukhin", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000318069172"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Theoretical Division (T-1, MS B221), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA."}], "LastName": "Kendrick", "ForeName": "Brian K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000000246677645"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Wehr Chemistry Building, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881, USA."}], "LastName": "Babikov", "ForeName": "Dmitri", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32295370", "10.1063/1.5141365"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
