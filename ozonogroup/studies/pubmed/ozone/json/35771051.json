This study developed an innovative method to fabricate a cathode with waste-tire carbon (WTC) whose performance was evaluated for the degradation of tinidazole (TNZ), an antibiotic frequently detected in water. It was found that the addition of WTC in the cathode can significantly promote the yield of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the current efficiency: around 2.7 times that of commercial carbon black at the same loading. The critical influencing factors were studied, including the current density, ozone concentration, initial pH value, chlorine ions and initial TNZ concentration. The scavenger tests demonstrated the possible involvement of \u2022OH and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>. Some transformation products of TNZ were identified with UPLC-MS and the degradation pathway was proposed accordingly. These results demonstrated the potential of WTC for developing E-Peroxone cathodes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: y.zhang@njtech.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Anlin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: y.zhang@njtech.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wanqun", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: y.zhang@njtech.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Leping", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: y.zhang@njtech.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yunhai", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: y.zhang@njtech.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yide", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, China E-mail: y.zhang@njtech.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yongjun", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "033KF7V46H", "NameOfSubstance": "Tinidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tinidazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35771051", "10.2166/wst.2022.178"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
