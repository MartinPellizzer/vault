In this study, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based biomass production potential test using indigenous bacterial communities were used to evaluate regrowth potential following ozonation with either biofiltration (BF) or sustained chlorination (SCl<sub>2</sub>). Two full-scale water treatment plants with different upstream processes (i.e., WTP-BF: ozonation, coagulation/flocculation, biofiltration, UV irradiation, chlorination; and WTP-SCl<sub>2</sub>: ozonation, chlorination, coagulation/flocculation, filtration, chlorination) were compared. Characterization of indigenous bacteria using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and cellular ATP (cATP) showed microbial diversity changes across treatment, biomass sloughing from biofilters (effluent cATP\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202fng/L), and disinfection by chlorine (cATP\u202f<\u202f1\u202fng/L). For both WTPs, 14-day cumulative biomass production (CBP<sub>t</sub>\u202f=\u202f \u2211t=0tATP(t)\u00d7\u0394t) was highest for ozonated water samples (CBP<sub>14</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>-3.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>\u202fd ngATP/L). CBP further increased with increasing ozone dose due to production of more biodegradable carbon. Growth promotion by carbon was confirmed from the consumption of ozonation byproducts (carboxylic acids, aldehydes) and the increase in CBP (9.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>2</sup>-2.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>\u202fd ngATP/L) after addition of 50-300 \u03bcgC/L acetate. Ozone followed by sustained chlorination (WTP-SCl<sub>2</sub>) effectively controlled biomass growth across the treatment process (CBP<sub>14</sub> <10\u202fd ngATP/L). In contrast, ozone followed by biofiltration (WTP-BF) reduced regrowth potential by 30% (biofilter influent CBP<sub>14</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>\u202fd ngATP/L; biofilter effluent CBP<sub>14</sub>\u202f=\u202f9.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>2</sup>\u202fd ngATP/L). After adding chlorine to the biofilter effluent, CBP<sub>14</sub> was reduced to <10\u202fd ngATP/L. Lastly, online ATP measurements confirmed the discrete measurements and improved identification of the cATP peak and growth phases of indigenous bacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).
