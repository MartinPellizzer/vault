The two enzyme derivatives thus formed, NFK- and Kyn-RNase T1, lost enzymatic activity at pH 7.5, at which native RNase T1 most efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of RNA. At pH 4.75, the modified enzymes retained a decreased but distinct enzymatic activity toward RNA without alteration of substrate specificity, and Kyn-RNase T1 was four times more active than NFK-RNase T1. The binding of 3'-GMP to these modified enzymes decreased remarkably at pH 5.5, the optimum pH for binding to the intact enzyme. The gamma-carboxyl group of glutamic acid 58 was still reactive to iodoacetic acid after modification of tryptophan 59. The amounts of the carboxymethyl group introduced into NFK- and Kyn-RNase T1 were 0.36 and 0.59 mol, respectively, under conditions such that quantitative esterification of native RNase T1 takes place. CD spectroscopy indicated that the tertiary structure of the molecule was disordered in NFK-RNase T1, but not significantly in Kyn-RNase T1. It is concluded that tryptophan 59 functions in maintaining the active conformation of the protein structure, particularly in constructing the active environment for a functionally important set of groups involved in the binding of the substrate at the active site, although direct participation of in tryptophan the catalytic function of ribonuclease T1 is unlikely."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamaoki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakiyama", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Narita", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodoacetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8DUH1N11BX", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptophan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribonucleases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.27.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribonuclease T1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glutamates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iodoacetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribonuclease T1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tryptophan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["417075", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a131971"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
