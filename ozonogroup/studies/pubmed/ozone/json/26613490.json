The proposed scheme is based on the adaptation of a highly efficient serial coupled-cluster code leading to a communication-minimized implementation by parallelizing the time-determining steps. The parallel algorithm is tailored for affordable cluster architectures connected by standard communication networks such as Gigabit Ethernet. In this way, CCSDT and Mk-MRCCSDT computations become feasible even for larger molecular systems and basis sets. An analysis of the time-determining steps for CCSDT and Mk-MRCCSDT, namely the computation of the triple-excitation amplitudes and their individual contributions, is carried out. Benchmark calculations are presented for the N2O, ozone, and benzene molecules, proving that the parallelization of these steps is sufficient to obtain an efficient parallel scheme. A first application to the case of 2,6-pyridyne using a triple-\u03b6 quality basis (222 basis functions) is presented demonstrating the efficiency of the current implementation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prochnow", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harding", "ForeName": "Michael E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gauss", "ForeName": "J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26613490", "10.1021/ct1002016"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
