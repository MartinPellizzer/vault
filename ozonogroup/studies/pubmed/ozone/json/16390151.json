To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the Pummerer rearrangement in selenoheterocycles. Ozonization of 1,4-anhydro-D-galactitol or 1,5-anhydroxylitol derivatives containing sulfur or selenium as the ring heteroatom gave unstable intermediates that were attributed to ozonides. These intermediates decomposed upon warming to give selenoxides or sulfoxides. Significantly, addition of acetic anhydride at low temperature to the ozonization reaction mixtures gave Pummerer-rearrangement products after warming to ambient temperature. However, when the isolated selenoxides or sulfoxides were treated with acetic anhydride, Pummerer rearrangement occurred but the sulfoxides required much higher reaction temperatures. The latter results are at variance with the former and are interpreted in terms of the rearrangement of the ozonide acetate intermediates in the former cases. To probe whether the rearrangement proceeded heterolytically via extrusion of singlet oxygen or homolytically via the generation of radical species, trapping experiments with rubrene and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies with the radical trap DMPO were performed. The results of these experiments are consistent with the intermediacy of radical species and suggest a new and milder synthetic method to generate Pummerer-type products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada V5A 1S6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veerapen", "ForeName": "Natacha", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "Stephanie A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walsby", "ForeName": "Charles J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "B Mario", "Initials": "BM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16390151", "10.1021/ja0557029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
