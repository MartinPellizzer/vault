The 1st group was exposed to acoustic trauma, the 2nd group was treated with ozone initially, and was exposed to acoustic trauma 24 h later, the 3rd group received ozone without trauma, while the 4th group was the control group. The 1st and 2nd groups were exposed to acoustic trauma with 105 dB SPL white band noise for 4h. DPOAE and ABR tests were conducted in all groups on the 1st, 5th, and 10th days after trauma.", "In the 1st group, the effects of acoustic trauma continued on days 1, 5 and 10. The 2nd group's DPOAE and ABR results on days 5 and 10 showed significant improvement at all frequencies compared to deterioration on day 1, and the readings were comparable to baseline measurements.", "Acoustic trauma is a pathology that is experienced frequently and leads to many problems in terms of health and cost.
