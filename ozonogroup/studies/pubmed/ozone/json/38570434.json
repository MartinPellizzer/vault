Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are used for deep petrochemical wastewater treatment with distinct advantages, including the complete mineralization of organic substances, minimal residual byproducts, and compatibility with biological treatment systems. This work evaluates the effectiveness of three methods, namely, ozone, persulfate, and O<sub>3</sub>-PMS (ozone-persulfate) processes, which were compared to remove soluble organic matter. The O<sub>3</sub>-PMS process offered significant advantages in terms of organic matter removal efficiency. This process involves ozone dissolution in an aqueous persulfate solution, producing a more significant amount of hydroxyl radicals in comparison to single AOPs. The production of hydroxyl radicals and the synergistic effect of hydroxyl radicals and persulfate radicals were investigated. In the O<sub>3</sub>-PMS process, transition metal ions were added to understand the mechanism of the O<sub>3</sub>-PMS coupled catalytic oxidation system. The results showed that when the ozone concentration was in the range of 5\u2009~\u200925\u00a0mg/L, the dosage of persulfate was in the range of 0.01\u2009~\u20090.05\u00a0mol/L, the dosage of metal compounds was in the range of 0:0\u2009~\u20092:1, and the reaction time was in the range of 0\u2009~\u20092\u00a0h; the optimum chemical oxygen demand (COD<sub>Cr</sub>) and total organic content (TOC) removal effect was achieved under the coupled system with an ozone concentration of 10\u00a0mg/L, a persulfate dosage of 0.02\u00a0mol/L, a 1:2 dosage ratio of between Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> compounds, and a reaction time of 2\u00a0h. Under optimal reaction conditions, the rates of COD<sub>Cr</sub> and TOC removal reached 70% and 79.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the removal kinetics of the O<sub>3</sub>-PMS coupled catalytic oxidation system was analyzed to optimize the removal conditions of COD and TOC, and the mechanism regulating the degradation of dissolved organic matter was explored by three-dimensional fluorescence and GC-MS technology. Thus, O<sub>3</sub>-PMS coupled catalytic oxidation is an effective process for the deep treatment of wastewater. The careful selection of transition metal ions serves as a theoretical foundation for the subsequent preparation of catalysts for the ozone persulfate oxidation system, and this study provides a suitable reference for removing organic matter from petrochemical wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024.
