The reactor was specifically designed in a fashion that gas induction was created on the liquid surface by the high-speed action of an impeller turbine inside a draft tube to maximize the ozone gas utilization. A new design feature of the present reactor system was a fixed granular activated carbon (GAC) bed packed in a circular compartment between the reactor wall and the shaft tube. The fixed GAC bed provided additional adsorption and catalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Combination of the fixed GAC bed and ozonation results in enhanced oxidation of organic pollutants. In addition to enhanced pollutant oxidation, ozonation was found to provide in situ GAC regeneration that was considered crucial in the present reaction system. Kinetic investigations were also made using a proposed complex kinetic model to elucidate the possible oxidation reaction mechanisms of the present gas-induced ozonation system. As a complementary measure, chemical coagulation pretreatment was found able to achieve up to 50% COD and 85% ADMI removal. Experimental tests were conducted to identify its optimum operating conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Chungli 320, Taiwan. cashlin@saturn.yzu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Sheng H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ching H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12628794", "10.1016/s0304-3894(03)00003-7", "S0304389403000037"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
