In this study, interannual variations in springtime ozone in Shanghai, China, from 2013 to 2021, were investigated to assess the health impacts and the effectiveness of recent air pollution control measures. A combination of ground-level measurements of regulated air pollutants, lidar observations, and backward trajectories of air masses was used to identify the key drivers for enhancing springtime O<sub>3</sub>. The results show that external imports of O<sub>3</sub> driven by atmospheric circulation are notable sources of springtime surface O<sub>3</sub>. For example, the downward transport from the free troposphere could contribute to over 50% of surface O<sub>3</sub> in the morning. The surface O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios in spring exhibited an upward trend of 0.93\u00a0ppb\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) from 2013 to 2021. The change in meteorological variables, particularly the increase in air temperature, could explain nearly 87% of the springtime O<sub>3</sub> upward trend. The change in anthropogenic emissions of precursors only contributed to a small fraction (<13%) of the increase in springtime O<sub>3</sub>. The cumulative exposure of urban residents to O<sub>3</sub> in spring also exhibited a significant upward trend (111\u00a0ppb\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). With the rapid increase in surface O<sub>3</sub>, premature respiratory mortality attributable to O<sub>3</sub> exposure has fluctuated at approximately 2933 deaths per year since 2016, even though the total deaths from respiratory diseases have significantly declined. Long-term exposure to high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations is a significant contributor to premature respiratory mortality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
