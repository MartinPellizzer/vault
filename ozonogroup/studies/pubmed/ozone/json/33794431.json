This review and meta-analysis aimed to derive a more reliable estimation on the association between air pollution and TB incidence. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science electronic databases were systemically searched for eligible literature. The PECO framework was used to form the eligibility criteria. Effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) published in the included studies were pooled quantitatively. Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates showed that long-term exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) was associated with increased incidence of TB (per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>: risk ratios (RR)\u00a0=\u00a01.058, 95% CI: 1.021-1.095). Besides, long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) were significantly associated with TB incidence (per 1\u00a0ppb increase, SO<sub>2</sub>: RR\u00a0=\u00a01.016, 95% CI: 1.001-1.031; NO<sub>2</sub>: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.002-1.017). We did not find a significant association of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO) with TB risk, regardless of long-term or short-term exposure. However, in view of the 2016 ASA Statement and the biological plausibility of PM<sub>2.5</sub> damaging host immunity, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and TB risk remains to be further established. This meta-analysis shows that long-term exposure to PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> is associated with increased odds of TB, and the specific biological mechanisms warrant further research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
