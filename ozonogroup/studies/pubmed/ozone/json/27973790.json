Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were 18 \u00b1 0.6 g/kg soil, and TPH carbon constituted \u223c40% of the dichloromethane-extractable carbon (DeOC) in the soil. At the benchmark dose of 3.4 kg O<sub>3</sub>/kg initial TPH, TPH carbon was reduced by nearly 6 gC/kg soil (40%), which was accompanied by an increase of about 4 gC/kg soil in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and a 4-fold increase in 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>). Disrupting gas channeling in the soil improved mass transport of O<sub>3</sub> to TPH bound to soil and increased TPH removal. Ozonation resulted in two measurable alterations of the composition of the organic carbon. First, part of DeOC was converted to DOC (\u223c4.1 gC/kg soil), 75% of which was not extractable by dichloromethane. Second, the DeOC containing saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA), was partially oxidized, resulting in a decline in saturates and aromatics, but increases in resins and asphaltenes. Ozone attack on resins, asphaltenes, and soil organic matter led to the production of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. The results illuminate the mechanisms by which ozone gas interacted with the weathered petroleum residuals in soil to generate soluble and biodegradable products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2472-0921"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology, Arizona State University , 727 Tyler Road, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5701, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University , Tempe, Arizona 85287-3005, United States."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tengfei", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology, Arizona State University , 727 Tyler Road, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5701, United States."}], "LastName": "Delgado", "ForeName": "Anca G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology, Arizona State University , 727 Tyler Road, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5701, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University , Tempe, Arizona 85287-3005, United States."}], "LastName": "Yavuz", "ForeName": "Burcu M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology, Arizona State University , 727 Tyler Road, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5701, United States."}], "LastName": "Maldonado", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chevron Energy Technology Company, San Ramon, California 94583, United States."}], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chevron Energy Technology Company, Houston, Texas 77002, United States."}], "LastName": "Kamath", "ForeName": "Roopa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University , Tempe, Arizona 85287-3005, United States."}], "LastName": "Westerhoff", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology, Arizona State University , 727 Tyler Road, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5701, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University , Tempe, Arizona 85287-3005, United States."}], "LastName": "Krajmalnik-Brown", "ForeName": "Rosa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology, Arizona State University , 727 Tyler Road, Tempe, Arizona 85287-5701, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University , Tempe, Arizona 85287-3005, United States."}], "LastName": "Rittmann", "ForeName": "Bruce E", "Initials": "BE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27973790", "10.1021/acs.est.6b04534"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
