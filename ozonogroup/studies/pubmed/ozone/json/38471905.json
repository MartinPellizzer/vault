The characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> concentration and climate background were analyzed based on daily O<sub>3</sub> concentration data\uff0c meteorological factors\uff0c and NCEP/NCER reanalysis data from 2006 to 2021 in Shanghai. In addition\uff0c the differences in atmospheric circulation situations during years with anomalous O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were compared and diagnosed from the perspective of climatology. Additionally\uff0c the monthly O<sub>3</sub> concentration prediction model \uff08seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous regressors\uff0c SARIMAX\uff09 was further established by adding the key meteorological factors. The results indicated that both the whole-year average and summer half-year average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Shanghai were increasing with fluctuation\uff0c and the summer half-year average was much higher than the annual average\uff0c up to 36.2%. Furthermore\uff0c there was a significant negative correlation between O<sub>3</sub> concentration and wind speed \uff08correlation coefficient of -0.826\uff09 and a significant positive correlation with the frequency of static wind and the number of days in which the low cloud cover was less than 20% \uff08correlation coefficients of 0.836 and 0.724\uff0c respectively\uff09. The monthly mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration had a clear periodicity\uff0c showing a pattern with a high concentration in the middle period \uff08April to September\uff09 and a low concentration at the beginning and end of the periods. High O<sub>3</sub> concentration years \uff082013-2021\uff09 were accompanied by more polluted days\uff0c lower average wind speed\uff0c more small wind \uff08\u22641.5 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>\uff09 days\uff0c more days of low cloud cover of less than 20%\uff0c more days of high temperature\uff0c higher direct solar radiation\uff0c and more sunshine hours. When the location of the stronger West Pacific subtropical high was westward and southward in the summer half-year\uff0c Shanghai was influenced by an anomalous westerly wind\uff0c which was not conducive to the transportation of clean air from the sea to Shanghai and thus led to the high concentration of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. When the long wave radiation emitted from the ground was low in the summer half-year\uff0c it was favorable for the increase in ground temperature and caused a high concentration of O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Adding direct solar radiation\uff0c maximum temperature\uff0c and wind speed as exogenous variables to the monthly O<sub>3</sub> forecast model could significantly improve the effectiveness of the monthly forecast\uff0c with the root mean square error decreasing by 47.7% \uff08from 22 to 11.5\uff09 and the correlation coefficient increasing by 11.2% \uff08from 0.819 to 0.911\uff09\uff0c which could be applied to the practical prediction of monthly O<sub>3</sub> concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Cities Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in Shanghai, Shanghai Climate Center, Shanghai 200030, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Qing-Feng", "Initials": "QF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Cities Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in Shanghai, Shanghai Climate Center, Shanghai 200030, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Yu-Sen", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yan-Fen", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Song-Jia", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Cities Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in Shanghai, Shanghai Climate Center, Shanghai 200030, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wei-Zhong", "Initials": "WZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471905", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202302043"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
