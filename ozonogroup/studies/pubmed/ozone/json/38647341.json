In this study, we successfully isolated a strain of denitrifying <i>Paracoccus denitrificans</i> R-1 from sewage treatment plant sludge. This strain has strong N<sub>2</sub>O reduction capability, and the average N<sub>2</sub>O reduction rate was 5.10 \u00b1 0.11 \u00d7 10<sup>-9</sup> \u00b5mol\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7cell<sup>-1</sup> under anaerobic condition in a defined medium. This reduction was accompanied by the stoichiometric consumption of acetate over time when N<sub>2</sub>O served as the sole electron acceptor and the reduction can yield energy to support microbial growth, suggesting that microbial N<sub>2</sub>O reduction is related to the energy generation process. Genomic analysis showed that the gene cluster encoding N<sub>2</sub>O reductase of <i>P. denitrificans</i> R-1 was composed of <i>nos</i>R, <i>nos</i>Z, <i>nos</i>D, <i>nos</i>F, <i>nos</i>Y, <i>nos</i>L, and <i>nos</i>Z, which was identified as that in other strains in clade I. Respiratory inhibitors test indicated that the pathway of electron transport for N<sub>2</sub>O reduction was different from that of the traditional electron transport chain for aerobic respiration. Cu<sup>2+</sup>, silver nanoparticles, O<sub>2</sub>, and acidic conditions can strongly inhibit the reduction, whereas NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> can promote it. These findings suggest that modular N<sub>2</sub>O reduction of <i>P. denitrificans</i> R-1 is linked to the electron transport and energy conservation, and dissimilatory N<sub>2</sub>O reduction is a form of microbial anaerobic respiration.", "Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is a potent greenhouse gas and contributor to ozone layer destruction, and atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O has increased steadily over the past century due to human activities. The release of N<sub>2</sub>O from fixed N is almost entirely controlled by microbial N<sub>2</sub>O reductase activities. Here, we investigated the ability to obtain energy for the growth of <i>Paracoccus denitrificans</i> R-1 by coupling the oxidation of various electron donors to N<sub>2</sub>O reduction. The modular N<sub>2</sub>O reduction process of denitrifying microorganism not only can consume N<sub>2</sub>O produced by itself but also can consume the external N<sub>2</sub>O generated from biological or abiotic pathways under suitable condition, which should be critical for controlling the release of N<sub>2</sub>O from ecosystems into the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0004-6199-6646"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay Area; Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jiaxian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay Area; Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Wenfang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay Area; Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiapeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay Area; Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay Area; Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xiaomei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Yangming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jih-Gaw", "Initials": "J-G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6255-4100"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay Area; Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Yiguo", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "42276130", "Agency": "MOST | National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microbiol Spectr", "NlmUniqueID": "101634614", "ISSNLinking": "2165-0497"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.7.2.4", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrous oxide reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Paracoccus denitrificans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denitrification"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38647341", "10.1128/spectrum.03811-23"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
