Total genomic DNA was amplified with random primers (random amplied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter- single sequence repeats (SSR)) to produce 73 genetic markers. In addition, allozyme and chloroplast variations were surveyed. Genetic markers were examined for association with O<sub>3</sub> resistance in 18 British populations of P. major as well as 27 continental European populations of P. major and P. intermedia. Two populations that exhibited increased resistance to O<sub>3</sub> following several years' exposure to high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the field showed decreased genetic variation over time. In addition, their genetic composition showed no drastic change, which suggests that the change in resistance to O<sub>3</sub> was probably the result of selection on genotypes already present in local populations (selection in situ). It appears that selection for O<sub>3</sub> resistance may occur in independent populations, and also may involve a number of genetically determined traits. Consequently the finding that plants with similar degrees of O<sub>3</sub> resistance are not closely related was not unexpected. However, the finding of an association of several genetic markers with O<sub>3</sub> resistance merits further investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, University of St Andrews, Sir Harold Mitchell Building, St Andrews, KY16 9TH, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolff", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, University of St Andrews, Sir Harold Mitchell Building, St Andrews, KY16 9TH, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan-Richards", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, University of St Andrews, Sir Harold Mitchell Building, St Andrews, KY16 9TH, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davison", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33862909", "10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00594.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
