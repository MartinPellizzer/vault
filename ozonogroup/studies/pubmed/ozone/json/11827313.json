Ozonation has been effective for their destruction in some studies. However, the natural organic matter (NOM) in waters can affect the ozonation process and subsequently affect the destruction of T&Os. Five NOM fractions were isolated and ozonated in synthetic waters. The fraction containing the more highly coloured, higher molecular weight compounds exhibited the highest ozone (O3) demand, whereas the low aromatic fraction exhibited the lowest O3 demand. The character of the NOM fractions influenced the ozonation of MIB and geosmin. The destruction of MIB and geosmin was significantly higher in the fraction with the highest colour and UV/visible absorbance at all O3 doses. The destruction of the compounds in the other fractions showed the same trends, increasing MIB and geosmin destruction with increasing UV/visible absorbing character of the NOM. MIB was also ozonated in two real waters. with results showing a competing effect between NOM concentration and NOM character. The O3 reaction time was shown to be important for the destruction of both compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Research Centre for Water Quality and Treatment, Salisbury SA, Australia. lionel.ho@sawater.sa.gov.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "Lionel", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newcombe", "ForeName": "Gayle", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crou\u00e9", "ForeName": "Jean-Philippe", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2371-42-8", "NameOfSubstance": "2-methylisoborneol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MYW912WXJ4", "NameOfSubstance": "geosmin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11827313", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00253-6", "S0043-1354(01)00253-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
