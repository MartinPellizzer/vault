Regionally, ozone is recognized as the pollutant of concern. Acidic depositions have also been suggested as being directly pathogenic in causing observed forests declines. However, forest tree declines are not new to the forest pathology literature. Pathological, entomological, and abiotic stress causal complexes have satisfactorily explained declines of several major hardwood and conifer species. We, as forest biologists, must recognize that numerous biotic and abiotic agents can directly incite forest tree diseases without the need of predispositional stress as initiated by air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The Pennsylvania State University, 16802, University Park, PA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Trends Ecol Evol. 1986 Jul;1(1):15-8", "ArticleIdList": ["21227772"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24249055", "10.1007/BF00396725"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
