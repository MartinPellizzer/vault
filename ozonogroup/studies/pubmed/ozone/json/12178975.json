A population exerts an impact on the environment based on 3 factors: the size of the population (P), the level of per capita consumption or affluence (A), and the measure of the impact of technology (T). In the US the P factor is huge: 250 million people. The sum of A and T factors (per-capita environmental impact) is 1 1/2 times that of the Soviet Union, twice that of Britain, Sweden, France, or Australia, 14 times that of China, and 40 times that of India. Americans burn 1/4 of the world's fossil fuels spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and use chlorofluorocarbons extensively that also add to the greenhouse effect and deplete the vital ozone shield. The key to civilization's survival is the reduction of the P, A, and T factors. In rich nations this can be accomplished by much more efficient use of energy and transition toward negative population growth. The best strategy is the Holdren scenario: rich countries would reduce their per capita energy use from almost 8 kilowatts to 3 kilowatts. In poor countries, per capita use would increase from 1.2 to 3 kilowatts resulting in the same standard of living at the end of a century. To prevent longterm deterioration it will be necessary to reduce population size substantially below 10 billion. The optimum population size of the US would be around 75 million people, a permanently sustainable nation with a high quality of life."]}], "OtherID": ["075047", "00214843"], "PMID": "12178975", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "04", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "Jan"}}, "Title": "NPG forum series", "ISOAbbreviation": "NPG Forum Ser"}, "ArticleTitle": "The most overpopulated nation.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "1", "EndPage": "4", "MedlinePgn": "1-4"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ehrlich", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ehrlich", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "NPG Forum Ser", "NlmUniqueID": "101096098"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy-Generating Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12178975"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
