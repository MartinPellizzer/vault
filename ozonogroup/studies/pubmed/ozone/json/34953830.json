Being highly stable to be completely metabolized, residual quantities of Levofloxacin get accumulated into the food chain proving a great global threat for aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems. Various removal techniques including both conventional and advanced methods have been reported for this purpose. This review is a novel attempt to make a critical analysis of the recent advances made exclusively toward the sequestration of Levofloxacin from wastewater through an extensive literature survey (2015-2021). Adsorption and advanced oxidation processes especially photocatalytic degradation are the most tested techniques in which assorted nanomaterials play a significant role. Several photocatalysts exhibited up to 100% degradation of LEV which makes photocatalytic degradation the best method among other tested methods. However, the degraded products need to be further monitored in terms of their toxicity. Biological degradation may prove to be the most environment-friendly with the least toxicity, unfortunately, not much research is reported in the field. With these key findings and knowledge gaps, authors suggest the scope of hybrid techniques, which have been experimented on other antibiotics. These can potentially minimize the disadvantages of the individual techniques concurrently improving the efficiency of LEV removal. Besides, techniques like column adsorption, membrane treatment, and ozonation, being least reported, reserve good perspectives for future research. With these implications, the review will certainly serve as a breakthrough for researchers working in this field to aid their future findings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
