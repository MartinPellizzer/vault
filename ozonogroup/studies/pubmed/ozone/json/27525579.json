About 100 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) will upgrade their treatment for micropollutant abatement in the future to comply with Swiss regulations. An upgrade with ozonation may lead to unintended bromate formation in bromide-containing wastewaters. Measured bromide concentrations were <0.05 mg L(-1) in \u223c75% of 69 WWTPs, while they ranged from 0.4 to \u223c50 mg L(-1) in WWTPs with specific bromide sources (e.g., municipal waste incinerators, landfill leachate, and chemical industry). Wastewater ozonation formed little bromate at specific ozone doses of \u22640.4 mg O3/mg DOC, while the bromate yields were almost linearly correlated to the specific ozone dose for higher ozone doses. Molar bromate yields for typical specific ozone doses in wastewater treatment (0.4-0.6 mg O3/mg DOC) are \u22643%. In a modeled extreme scenario (in which all upgraded WWTPs release 10 \u03bcg L(-1) of bromate), bromate concentrations increased by <0.4 \u03bcg L(-1) in major Swiss rivers and by several micrograms per liter in receiving water bodies with a high fraction of municipal wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Soltermann", "ForeName": "Fabian", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ERZ Entsorgung + Recycling Z\u00fcrich , CH-8050 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Abegglen", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Envilab , CH-4800 Zofingen, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "G\u00f6tz", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics, ETH Z\u00fcrich , CH-8092 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27525579", "10.1021/acs.est.6b01142"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
