It is well known, that particles of nano-sized diameter pose a threat for human health causing, among others: eye, upper airway irritation, inflammatory response in cells, worsening asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and central nervous dysfunction. Terpenes are reactive VOCs, commonly emitted in indoor air and considered to be SOA precursors by oxidation reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative humidity influence on i) formation of limonene ozonolysis products and ii) SOA formation process - especially the first steps of it. We managed to determine 4 uncommon limonene ozonolysis products (m/z: 43, 83, 99 and 110) appearing in the PTR-TOF-MS mass spectra with the same frequency as well-known formaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid and formic acid. We also detected m/z 75 and m/z 115 formed under dry conditions and m/z 111 and m/z 125 formed under humid conditions. Detected masses formula is proposed with probability >70 % and the probability is derived from the deviation of the exact mass to the measured one and the isotope distribution. SMPS data analysis allowed us to conclude that RH around 40% increases particle mass concentration, regardless initial limonene concentration. Unfortunately, conclusions about RH influence on particle number concentration are inconsistent. Under low initial terpene concentration, RH around 40% decreases particle number concentration. However, for high initial limonene concentration, RH around 40% caused increase in particle number concentration. Obtained results allowed to conclude, that i) RH influences both particle number and particle mass concentration, ii) initial substrate concentration influences SOA formation altering the RH effect, iii) comparison of results and drawing conclusions is difficult due to different experimental protocols in the literature and due to the number of factors influencing SOA formation initiated by terpene oxidation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
