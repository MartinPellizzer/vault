The models were developed by using generalized linear model. The gender of the premature birth was analyzed by subgroup analysis. Sensitive analysis were used to estimate the model stability. <b>Results:</b> Ambient O(3) daily average concentrations and maximum concentration of 8 hours in Taiyuan of 2013 to 2015 were 45.35 \u03bcg/m(3) and 71.33 \u03bcg/m(3) respectively. In single pollutant model, the effects of different window exposures on premature birth were different. The <i>RR</i> of preterm birth about an increase of 10 \u03bcg/m(3) of O(3) (lag 3 weeks, lag 4 weeks) were 1.090 (95<i>%CI</i>: 1.042-1.139), 1.095 (95<i>%CI</i>: 1.032-1.163) respectively. According to the infant gender subgroup analysis, male infants were more likely to be affected by ambient O(3). The average daily of O(3) concentration increased by 10 \u03bcg/m(3), and the <i>RR</i> for male infants and female infant were 1.013 (95<i>%CI</i>: 0.997-1.029), 0.996 (95<i>%CI</i>: 0.983-1.010) respectively. By comparing the daily average concentration of O(3) with the maximum daily concentration of O(3) for 8 hours as an indicator of exposure, it was found that the daily average concentration of O(3) was more sensitive. The <i>RR</i> of preterm birth about an increase of 10 \u03bcg/m(3) of average daily of O(3) concentration and the maximum daily concentration of O(3) for 8 hours. were 1.006 (95<i>%CI</i>: 0.994-1.017) and 0.997 (95<i>%CI</i>: 0.988-1.005) respectively. As for sensitive analysis, when O(3) introduced PM(2.5) or change the degree of model variables, the association of premature birth was still constant. <b>Conclusion:</b> Prenatal exposure to O(3) may increase the risk of premature birth, with different window exposures premature births have different risks and this risk is more pronounced in male infants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Z Y", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y W", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "91543111, 21277135", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "7172145", "Agency": "Beijing Natural Science Foundation", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7904962", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Premature Birth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30196636", "10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2018.09.007"]}}]}
