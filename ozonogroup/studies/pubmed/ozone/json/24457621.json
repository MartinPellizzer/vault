Pseudo-first-order rate constants, kapp, and overall reactive uptake coefficients, \u03b3, were obtained through changes in the absorbance of C[double bond, length as m-dash]O stretching bands at 1695 cm(-1), which is assigned to the carbonyl group in carboxylic acid. Results showed that the reaction followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and kapp was largely dominated by surface reaction over bulk phase reaction. In addition, both the kapp and the \u03b3 values showed very strong temperature dependences (\u223ctwo orders of magnitude) over the temperature range; in contrast, they only slightly increased with increasing RH values from 0-80%. According to the kapp values as a function of temperature, the activation energy for the heterogeneous reaction was estimated to be 80.6 kJ mol(-1). Our results have suggested that heterogeneous reactions between ozone and unsaturated solid surfaces likely have a substantially greater temperature dependence than liquid ones. Moreover, the hygroscopic properties of EA thin films before and after exposure to ozone were also studied by measurement of water uptake. Based on the hygroscopicity data, the insignificant RH effect on reaction kinetics was probably due to the relatively weak water uptake by the unreacted and reacted EA thin films."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO 80217, USA. yong.liu@ucdenver.edu."}], "LastName": "Leng", "ForeName": "Chunbo", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hiltner", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pham", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kelley", "ForeName": "Judas", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mach", "ForeName": "Mindy", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yunhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Erucic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "075441GMF2", "NameOfSubstance": "erucic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erucic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wettability"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24457621", "10.1039/c3cp54646b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
