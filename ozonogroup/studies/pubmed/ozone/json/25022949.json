Herein, we present a hemocompatible PS 96-well microplate with adjustable PEGylated hyperbranch brush coverage prepared by ozone pretreated activation and thermally induced surface PEGylation. The grafting properties, hydration capacity, and blood compatibility of the PEGylated hyperbrush immobilized PS surfaces in human blood were illustrated by the combined chemical and physical properties of the surface, and the dependence of the specific absorption of human plasma fibrinogen onto the PEGylated surfaces on the grafting density was analyzed by monoclonal antibodies. The surface coverage of PEGylated brushes plays a major role in the bioadhesive properties of modified PS microplates, which in turn control the level of agglutination sensitivity in blood typing. The bioadhesive resistance toward proteins, platelets, and erythrocytes in human whole blood showed a correlation to the controlled hydration properties of the PEGylated hyperbrush-modified surfaces. Therefore, we suggested that the surface coverage of PEGylated hyperbrushes on PS surfaces can increase the sensitivity of cross-matching blood agglutination by up to 16-fold compared to that of the conventional 96-well virgin PS due to the regulated biorecognition of hematocrit and antibodies of the PEGylated hyperbrush-modified surfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University , Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yan-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yung", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Rong-Ho", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen-Tyng", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chinnathambi", "ForeName": "Arunachalam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alharbi", "ForeName": "Sulaiman Ali", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsiue", "ForeName": "Ging-Ho", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polystyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Grouping and Crossmatching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polystyrenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25022949", "10.1021/la501396e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
