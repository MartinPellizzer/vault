Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), due to their unique characteristics, have been considered for the construction of proton and other radiation sensors. Here, a single wall CNT based proton sensor was fabricated on FR4 substrate and its response to 150 MeV proton irradiation was studied. The change in the resistance of the nanotubes upon irradiation is exploited as the sensing mechanism and the sensor shows good sensitivity to proton radiation. Proton radiation induces dissociation of ambient oxygen, followed by the adsorption of oxygen species on the nanotube surface, which influences its electrical characteristics. Since the nanotube film is thin and the 150 MeV protons are expected to penetrate into and interact with the substrate, control experiments were conducted to study the impact on FR4 substrate without the nanotubes. The dielectric loss tangent or dissipation factor of FR4 increases after irradiation due to an increase in the cross-linking of the resin arising from the degradation of the polymer network."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3678-9651"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Reliability Sciences & Technologies, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electronics Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Vimal Kant", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6330-3899"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Reliability Sciences & Technologies, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Reliability Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, 24301, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Guishan, Taoyuan, 333, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electronics Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Cher Ming", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Nanotechnology, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universities Space Research Association, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sunjin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Reliability Sciences & Technologies, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Preetpal", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2282-9779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Reliability Sciences & Technologies, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Vivek", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5118-1310"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Nanotechnology, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States of America."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universities Space Research Association, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jin-Woo", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9202-412X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Nanotechnology, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Meyyappan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34038895", "10.1088/1361-6528/ac056d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
