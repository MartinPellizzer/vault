Recently, the growing interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials, often rich in interesting properties and functionalities compared to their bulk counterparts, has led to the investigation of 2D MoO<sub>3</sub>. However, the realization of large-area true 2D (single to few atom layers thick) MoO<sub>3</sub> is yet to be achieved. Here, we demonstrate a facile route to obtain wafer-scale monolayer amorphous MoO<sub>3</sub> using 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> as a starting material, followed by UV-ozone oxidation at a substrate temperature as low as 120 \u00b0C. This simple yet effective process yields smooth, continuous, uniform, and stable monolayer oxide with wafer-scale homogeneity, as confirmed by several characterization techniques, including atomic force microscopy, numerous spectroscopy methods, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, using the subnanometer MoO<sub>3</sub> as the active layer sandwiched between two metal electrodes, we demonstrate the thinnest oxide-based nonvolatile resistive switching memory with a low voltage operation and a high ON/OFF ratio. These results (potentially extendable to other TMOs) will enable further exploration of subnanometer stoichiometric MoO<sub>3</sub>, extending the frontiers of ultrathin flexible oxide materials and devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4923-0873"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microelectronics Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin,
