Ammonia, an upper-airway irritant, produces burning of the eyes, nose, and throat, and a decrease in respiratory rate. The effects of exposure to these two prototypical irritants were examined to see if behavioral changes during and after exposure occurred at concentrations comparable to those that produce symptoms in humans. Long-Evans rats and Swiss mice, individually housed in running wheels, were exposed either to ozone (0.08, 0.12, 0.25, or 0.5 ppm) or to ammonia (100 or 300 ppm) for 6 hr. Each animal's behavior was compared with its own control performance. Running in both species decreased in a concentration-related manner during exposure to either irritant. The decrease in running activity produced by high concentrations of ozone persisted for several hours after exposure. Concentrations of ammonia that eliminated running during exposure led to an increase in activity following exposure. At comparable concentrations of both compounds, activity in rats decreased more than in mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tepper", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weiss", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DA 00623", "Acronym": "DA", "Agency": "NIDA NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-02147", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8200838", "ISSNLinking": "0272-0590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4092873", "10.1016/0272-0590(85)90147-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
