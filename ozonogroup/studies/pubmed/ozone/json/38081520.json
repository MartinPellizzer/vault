The removal and mineralization of ATZ was significantly enhanced, obtaining the degradation rate constant (k) by Fe-N-CNT/EP (0.23 min<sup>-1</sup>) about two times that of EP (0.12 min<sup>-1</sup>) owing to the formation of Fe<sup>0</sup> and Fe-N coordination in Fe-N-CNT catalyst for co-catalysis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. The important factors such as applied current and ozone concentration were investigated, demonstrating that the optimized performance could be achieved at current of 30\u00a0mA and ozone concentration of 55\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. The oxidation capacity of Fe-N-CNT/EP maintained stably under wide pH range of 3\u223c7, obtaining the degradation rate constant 1.23-1.92 times that of EP and overcoming the defect of EP at acidic and neutral conditions. Capture experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments verified that <sup>.</sup>OH, generated by accelerating decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> and peroxone reaction, was the dominant active specie in Fe-N-CNT/EP. Besides, Fe-N-CNT showed high catalytic activity and good stability during six cycles. This work provides an efficient activator for enhanced EP process, exhibiting a promising prospect for water and wastewater purification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
