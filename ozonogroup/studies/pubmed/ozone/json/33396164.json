The goal of our study is to summarize the impacts of O<sub>3</sub> on physiology, growth, yield, and quality of soybean, as well as root parameters. We performed meta-analysis on the collated 48 peer-reviewed papers published between 1980 and 2019 to quantitatively summarize the response of soybean to elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations ([O<sub>3</sub>]). Relative to charcoal-filtered air (CF), elevated [O<sub>3</sub>] significantly accelerated chlorophyll degradation, enhanced foliar injury, and inhibited growth of soybean, evidenced by great reductions in leaf area (-20.8%), biomass of leaves (-13.8%), shoot (-22.8%), and root (-16.9%). Shoot of soybean was more sensitive to O<sub>3</sub> than root in case of biomass. Chronic ozone exposure of about 75.5 ppb posed pronounced decrease in seed yield of soybean (-28.3%). In addition, root environment in pot contributes to higher reduction in shoot biomass and yield of soybean. Negative linear relationships were observed between yield loss and intensity of O<sub>3</sub> treatment, AOT40. The larger loss in seed yield was significantly associated with higher reduction in shoot biomass and other yield component. This meta-analysis demonstrates the effects of elevated O<sub>3</sub> on soybean were pronounced, suggesting that O<sub>3</sub> pollution is still a soaring threat to the productivity of soybean in regions with high ozone levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
