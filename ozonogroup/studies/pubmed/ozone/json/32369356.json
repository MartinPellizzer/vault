Washing with chemical sanitizers, commonly used by the industry, is limited in its effectiveness and is viewed as a possible cross-contamination opportunity. This review discuses the advanced oxidation process (AOP), which involves generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals to inactivate human pathogens. Ionizing irradiation, ultraviolet (UV) light, and cold plasma can be regarded as AOP; however, AOPs employing combinations of UV, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, cold plasma, and ozone may be more promising because higher amounts of hydroxyl radicals are produced in comparison to the individual treatments and the combinative AOPs may be more consumer friendly than ionizing irradiation. When applied as a gaseous/aerosolized treatment, AOPs may have advantages over immersion treatments, considering the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals and presence of organic materials in wash water. Gaseous/aerosolized AOPs achieve up to 5 log reductions of pathogenic bacteria on fresh produce compared to reductions of 1-2 logs with aqueous sanitizers. Further research needs to be conducted on specific AOPs before being considered for commercialization, such as reduced formation of undesirable chemical byproducts, impact on quality, and scaled up studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1656-7522"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eastern Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 600 East Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania 19038, United States."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Xuetong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eastern Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 600 East Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania 19038, United States."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Decontamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Foodborne Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32369356", "10.1021/acs.jafc.0c01381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
