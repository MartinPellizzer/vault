A new type of high pulse voltage source with a thyratron switch and a Blumlein pulse forming network (BPFN) was adopted in our experiments, and the testing malodorants were ammonia, ethanethiol and tri-methyl amine, respectively. The maximum output power of the pulse voltage source and the maximum peak voltage were 1 kW and 100 kV. The experiments were conducted at the gas-flow rate of 4.0-23.0 m3 h(-1). Important parameters, including peak voltage, pulse frequency, capacitance (inductance) of the BPFN, gas-flow rate, initial concentration, which influenced on the removal efficiency, were investigated. The results show that the odors can be treated effectively. Almost 100% removal efficiency was obtained for 32 mg m(-3) ammonia at the gas-flow rate of 4.0 m(3) h(-1). The maximum removal efficiencies of 85 mg m(-3) ethanethiol and 750 mg m(-3) tri-methyl amine at 10.0 m(3) h(-1) were 98% and 91%, respectively. The energy yield of 110 mg m(-3) ammonia was 2.99 g kWh(-1) when specific energy density was 106 Jl(-1). In the cases of ammonia, ethanethiol and tri-methyl amine removal, ozone and nitrogen oxides were observed in the exit gas. The carbon and sulfur elements of ethanethiol and tri-methyl amine were mainly converted to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Moreover, the ammonium nitrates and sulfur were discovered in the reactor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China. ruanjj80@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Jian-Jun", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Tian-En", "Initials": "TE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LHH7G8O305", "NameOfSubstance": "trimethylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M439R54A1D", "NameOfSubstance": "ethanethiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15763085", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.10.025", "S0045-6535(04)00979-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
