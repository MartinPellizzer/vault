Recent studies demonstrated that interfacial phospholipid films appreciably inhibited NO(2) absorption. Because surface-active phospholipids are present on alveolar and airway interfaces, we investigated the effects of interfacial films on O(3)-reactive absorption and acute cell injury. Compressed films of dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and rat lung lavage lipids significantly reduced O(3)-reactive absorption by ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, and uric acid. Conversely, unsaturated phosphatidylcholine films did not inhibit O(3) absorption. We evaluated O(3)-mediated cell injury using a human lung fibroblast cell culture system, an intermittent tilting exposure regimen to produce a thin covering layer, and nuclear fluorochrome permeability. Exposure produced negligible injury in cells covered with MEM. However, addition of AH(2) produced appreciable (<50%) cell injury. Film spreading of DPPC monolayers necessitated the use of untilted regimens. Induction of acute cell injury in untilted cultures required both AH(2) plus very high O(3) concentrations. Addition of DPPC films significantly reduced cell injury. We conclude that acute cell injury likely results from O(3) reaction with ELF substrates. Furthermore, interfacial films of surface-active, saturated phospholipids reduce the local dose of O(3)-derived reaction products. Finally, because O(3) local dose and tissue damage likely correlate, we propose that interfacial phospholipids may modulate intrapulmonary distribution of inhaled O(3) and the extent of site-specific cell injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Biological Chemistry, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Connor", "ForeName": "Lydia M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ballinger", "ForeName": "Carol A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Albrecht", "ForeName": "Thomas B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Postlethwait", "ForeName": "Edward M", "Initials": "EM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 HL054696", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-54696", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100901229", "ISSNLinking": "1040-0605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2644-64-6", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14729514", "10.1152/ajplung.00397.2003", "00397.2003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
