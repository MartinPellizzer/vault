In the summer of 2018 (from June to August), Dezhou experienced serious ozone pollution episodes. The daily 8-hour maximum ozone concentrations exceeded the national standard for 60 days with the standard exceeding ratio of 65%. The average of daily 8-hour maximum ozone concentration was 176 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> over these three months, and the highest value reached was 262 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. In this study, the WRF-CAMx model coupled with the higher-order decoupled direct method (HDDM) was used to analyze the ozone sensitivity and emission control plans in Dezhou during this period. The results showed that ozone formation was in the strong VOC-limited regime in the urban area of Dezhou, while it was in the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs transition regime in suburban areas. VOCs sensitivity values (dO<sub>3</sub>_V<sub>50</sub>) were positive every day in summer, which was higher in June (18.7 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in urban area, 19.7 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in suburban area) and August (15.3 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in urban area, 16.4 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in suburban area) than in July (13.0 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in urban area, 11.8 \u03bcg \u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in suburban area). NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivity values (dO<sub>3</sub>_N<sub>50</sub>) were positive or negative in the urban area, and most days were positive in the suburban area, which were close to the VOCs sensitivity values. For urban areas, VOC reduction should be the priority for emission reduction plans, whereas for suburban areas, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>\uff1aVOCs=1\uff1a1 is recommended because the reductions in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs emissions had the same effect on ozone pollution control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ru-Sha", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124275", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202001197"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
