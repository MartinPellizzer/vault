Previous investigations of nonasthmatic subjects revealed that ozone induces both nasal and bronchial inflammation, suggesting that nasal responses to ozone may be used as a surrogate marker for the effect of this pollutant on bronchial mucosal inflammation. In this study, the effect of exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone on nasal inflammation in 11 allergic asthmatics sensitive to Dermatophygoides farinae was examined. This study was designed such that the effect of ozone exposure on the late-phase reaction to allergen was emphasized, using eosinophil influx and changes in eosinophil cationic protein as principal endpoints. By employing a \"split-nose\" design, in which allergen was applied to only one side of the nose while saline was applied to the contralateral side, both the effect of ozone on nasal inflammation due to allergen challenge as well as its direct action on non-allergen-challenged nasal tissues was examined. The results reported herein indicate that ozone exposure has both a priming effect on allergen-induced responses as well as an intrinsic inflammatory action in the nasal airways of perennially allergic asthmatics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27514, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peden", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Setzer", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devlin", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "55-MO1-RR00046", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha 1-Antitrypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "alpha 1-Antitrypsin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7735583", "10.1164/ajrccm.151.5.7735583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
