The effect of acetylene and NO(x) on ozone production by photochemical reactions was discussed. The wall decay of O3 and NO2 were determined, which were 5.80 x 10(-6) s(-1) and 2.41 x 10(-6) s(-1), respectively. Such decay should be omitted relative to O3 and NO2 in simulative experiments. The effective light intensity for a single black lamp of 40 W was determined to be 0.64 x 10(-3) s(-1), which was expressed by the photolysis rate of NO2. The effect of different light intensity, initial concentrations of acetylene and NO(x) on O3 production was discussed after correction of background O3 from purified air. The incremental reactivity (IR) of acetylene were calculated. For four different experiments, the maximum values of IR are 1.76 x 10(-2), 2.68 x 10(-2), 2.04 x 10(-2) and 2.84 x 10(-2), respectively. It is found that there are close relationships between IR and initial acetylene concentrations, and between IR and irradiation intensity, and that there is no significant relation between IR and initial NO(x) concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China. du_lin@iccas.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yong-Fu", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Mao-Fa", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Geng-Chen", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dian-Xun", "Initials": "DX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OC7TV75O83", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17633620"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
