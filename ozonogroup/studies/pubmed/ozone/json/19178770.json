Taking into account that a transient and controlled administration of ozone is able to upregulate cellular antioxidant enzymes, a morphological, biochemical and functional renal study was performed in rats undergoing warm renal ischaemia.", "Rats were divided into four groups. All except the negative controls underwent 60 min' bilateral renal ischaemia followed by 10 days' reperfusion. The positive control group received no further treatment. The ozone group received an ozone/oxygen mixture (ozone dose 0.5 mg/kg) immediately after the ischaemia and daily for the 10 days' reperfusion; the oxygen group were given the same concentration of oxygen alone (13 mg/kg). Biochemical parameters fructosamine, phospholipase A2, catalase, superoxide dismutase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured, as well as renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate.", "Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased significantly in the positive controls and the oxygen group whereas values in the ozone group were similar to those in the negative control group. With respect to the biochemical parameters, ozone maintained a homeostasis redox, with significant increases in catalase and superoxide dismutase activities and similar values for phospholipase A2 and fructosamine compared with the negative control group. Fewer morphological alterations were seen in kidneys from the ozone group. No advantages were obtained in the positive control and oxygen groups.", "The protective effect of ozone may be explained by upregulation of the antioxidant defence system and beneficial effects on blood circulation and in oxygen metabolism. Ozone treatment may represent a therapeutic approach for minimising renal damage after transplantation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ozone International Clinic, Ozone Research Center, Havana, Cuba."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calunga", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Luis", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trujillo", "ForeName": "Yanelis", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Men\u00e9ndez", "ForeName": "Silvia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamora", "ForeName": "Zullyt", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alonso", "ForeName": "Yaima", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merino", "ForeName": "Nelson", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montero", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4429-04-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipases A2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipases A2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Warm Ischemia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19178770", "10.1211/jpp/61.02.0012"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
