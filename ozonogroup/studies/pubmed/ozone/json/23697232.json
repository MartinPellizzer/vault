The effect of these salts on discoloration, degradation dynamics, and the composition of the final compounds were studied. Different systems were evaluated; such as RB5-Na2SO4 (100 g/L), RB5-Na2CO3 (30 g/L), RB5-Na2SO4/Na2CO3 (100 g/ L/30 g/L), and DR28-Na2SO4 (10 g/L, 40 g/L, and 80 g/L) with dye concentrations of 50, 150, and 250 mg/L without pH adjustment. Discoloration of RB5 and DR28 with and without additives was determined by visible and UV (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Decomposition of the dyes and the dynamics of intermediates and final byproducts were followed by high performance liquid chromatography. The presence of additives accelerated discoloration and decomposition for both dyes (more than 50%). The accumulation of oxalic and formic acids was observed. Possible mechanism schemes of ozonation for both dyes are proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Superior School of Chemical Engineering, National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (ESIQIE-IPN) Edif. 7, UPALM, Mexico D.F., C.P 07738."}], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Poznyak", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chairez", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O0HDY58362", "NameOfSubstance": "Remazol black B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23697232", "10.2175/106143013x13596524515988"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
