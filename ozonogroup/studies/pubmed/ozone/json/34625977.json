Previous studies reported that the thiocyanate (TC) excretion in the urine of cattle fed rapeseed meals containing glucosinolates was positively correlated with the N<sub>2</sub> O-nitrogen (N) emissions. The objectives of the experiment were to verify the effects and the mechanism of TC on the N<sub>2</sub> O-N emissions from the soil applied with artificial urine using static incubation technique. Four levels of TC, that is 0.00, 0.26, 0.78 and 2.33\u2009mmol\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> were composited in artificial urine as experimental treatments. Soil inorganic N and bacterial community were analyzed to elucidate the effects of TC on the N<sub>2</sub> O-N emissions of artificial urine.", "Adding TC increased the N<sub>2</sub> O-N fluxes, the N<sub>2</sub> O-N to N application ratio, and the estimated N<sub>2</sub> O-N emissions from the soil applied with artificial urine both linearly and quadratically. The estimated N<sub>2</sub> O-N emission (Y, in \u03bcmol) was increased with the TC adding level (X, in \u03bcmol) in a quadratic manner: <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>Y</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>52.57</mn> <mo>+</mo> <mn>4.47</mn> <mi>X</mi> <mo>-</mo> <mn>0.123</mn> <msup><mi>X</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> (R <sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.70). Adding TC did not affect the soil bacterial diversity and richness, but increased the relative abundances of Nitrosomonas (both for nitrification and denitrification) and Hyphomicrobium, Lysobacter and Terrimonas (for denitrification), and tended to increase the relative abundances of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium.", "TC increased the N<sub>2</sub> O-N emissions of the soil applied with artificial urine possibly through enhancing the denitrification of nitrifiers in the soil.
