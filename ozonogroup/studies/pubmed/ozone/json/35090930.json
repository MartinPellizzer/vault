We performed an experiment on key pollutants and an ozone formation study in Hefei, which is a pivotal city in the Yangtze-Huaihe region, from September 1 to 20, 2020. The aerosols retrieved via two-dimensional Multi-axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (2D-MAX-DOAS) with a Boltzmann-shaped a priori profile had the best agreement with the results of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and sun-photometer measurements among the three typical a priori profiles (Gaussian, Boltzmann, and exponential shapes). The correlation coefficients of the near-surface gas concentrations retrieved using both 2D-MAX-DOAS and in situ measurements were 0.86 (NO<sub>2</sub>) and 0.61 (HCHO). The high NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO concentrations were observed at azimuths of 180\u00b0 and 315\u00b0 at heights of 0.8-1.5 km, and they may have been emitted by aircrafts. Importantly, the ratio of HCHO to NO<sub>2</sub> during a typical pollution episode revealed that the factors controlling the O<sub>3</sub> formation changed with altitude: VOCs (surface) to NOx (0.4 km) to transition (1.0 km) to VOCs (1.6 km). Moreover, the effect of VOCs on the O<sub>3</sub> generation was stronger than that of NOx, especially in the downtown area of Hefei. When the ratio of HCHO to NO<sub>2</sub> was 3.55-7.46, the ozone concentration in Hefei could be controlled well, especially at the optimal value of 5.50."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
