The correlation between O3 and its precursors (NO, NO2, CO) and related meteorological factors (solar radiation, temperature) was analyzed. The results show that O3 pollution during summer was very serious in Ji'nan, and the levels of O3, NO, NO2, NOx and CO were quite high during the observational period. O3 concentrations were well negatively correlated with NO, NO2, NO, and CO during day time. As to the meteorological factors, O3 concentrations correlated well with solar radiations, but showed no obvious correlation with the temperatures. Consequently, based on the above data and results, a regression equation that relates ozone concentrations observed in the day time to its precursors and solar radiation was constructed. The results show that the calculated values were in good agreement with the observed values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Ji' nan 250100, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wen-po", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yong-quan", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Shi-yong", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Huai-zhong", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Lu-jian", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16881294"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
