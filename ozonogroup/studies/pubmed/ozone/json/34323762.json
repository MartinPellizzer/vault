For pretreatment, ozone direct oxidation could remarkably reduce UV<sub>254</sub>, 3D fluorescence peak value and fluorescence regional integration (FRI) of organic pollutants. For ABMBR treatment, the removal efficiencies of COD and ammonia nitrogen were 80.38% and 21.56%, respectively. Post-treatment included struvite precipitation, ozone catalytic oxidation and membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment. Finally, the total removal efficiencies of COD and ammonia nitrogen were 91.2% and 99.4%, respectively. The chroma was remarkably decreased from 1250 times to 40 times after a series of treatments. The acids in ABMBR could be degraded by microorganisms of Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. The cellulose and polysaccharides could be decomposed by Bacteroidetes and ketones could be decomposed by Brevundimonas in ABMBR. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis indicated that the hydroxyl radicals were the main reactive oxygen species during the direct ozone oxidation process, while the superoxide radicals played an important role in the ozone catalytic oxidation process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
