Oxidation could lead to chemical property and toxicity potency changes of BC. The key cytokines participating in lung damage in mice induced by BC and ozone-oxidized BC (oBC) particles have been investigated in this study. It was concluded that oBC has stronger potency of inducing lung damage in mice comparing to BC. IL-6 and IL-33 were hypothesized to play important roles in this damage. Accordingly, IL-6 and IL-33 neutralizing antibodies were used to explore which cytokine might play a key role in lung inflammation induced by BC and oBC. As a result, IL-6 neutralizing antibody did not alleviate the lung damage induced by BC and oBC. However, IL-33 neutralizing antibody prevented BC and oBC induced lung damage. Furthermore, IL-33 neutralizing antibody treatment reduced IL-6 mRNA expression. It is hypothesized that MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways might be involved in the oBC particles caused lung damage. It was concluded that IL-33 plays a key role in BC and oBC induced lung damage in mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
