Building on three existing ozone (O3)-focused research sites begun in mid-1992, the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Study (SEARCH) was initiated in mid-1998 as a 7-year observation and research program with a broader focus including aerosols and an expanded geographical coverage in the Southeast. The monitoring network comprises four urban-rural (or urban-suburban) site pairs at locations along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and inland, including two moderately sized and two major urban areas (Pensacola, FL; Gulfport, MS; Atlanta, GA; and Birmingham, AL). The sites are equipped with an extensive suite of instruments for measuring particulate matter (PM), gases relevant to secondary O3 and the production of secondary aerosol particles, and surface meteorology. The measurements taken to date have added substantially to the knowledge about the temporal behavior and geographic variability of tropospheric aerosols in the Southeast. Details are presented in four papers to follow."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "D Alan", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edgerton", "ForeName": "Eric S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hartsell", "ForeName": "Benjamin E", "Initials": "BE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jansen", "ForeName": "John J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kandasamy", "ForeName": "Navaneethakrishnan", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hidy", "ForeName": "George M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blanchard", "ForeName": "Charles L", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Southeastern United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14700133", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466318"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
