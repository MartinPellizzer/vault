Produce either remained at room temperature for 2\u00a0h or were frozen at -20\u00b0C and then tempered overnight at 4\u00b0C to mimic the preprocessing steps of a raw pet food processing operation ('freeze-temper') prior to ozone treatment. Two ozone concentrations (0 and 5\u00a0ppm) were applied for either 20\u00a0s or 60\u00a0s for BWOSS and 20\u00a0s for SWOSS. Based on an ANOVA, BWOSS data showed no significant difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) in microbial reduction between 0 and 5 ppm ozone concentration across all treatment durations for each produce type. BWOSS resulted in mean microbial reductions of up to 1.56\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/mL depending on the treatment time and produce type. SWOSS data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with Quasipoisson errors. Freeze-tempered produce treated with SWOSS had a higher bacterial log reduction at 5\u00a0ppm ozone compared to 0\u00a0ppm ozone (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0013) whereas room temperature produce treated with SWOSS did not show any significant difference in microbial reduction between ozone concentrations. The potential to mitigate microbial cross-contamination was also investigated during SWOSS treatment. The results indicate that 5\u00a0ppm ozone decreased pathogens in the rinsate and proximal surfaces by 0.63-1.66\u00a0log CFU/mL greater than no ozone depending on the pathogen and sample. Overall, data from this study indicate that SWOSS would be more effective compared to BWOSS in reducing the microbial load present on the surface of root tubers and squash subjected to freezing and thawing and has the potential to mitigate cross-contamination within RMDB manufacturing environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
