In this study, application of ozonation and various types of AOPs including photocatalysis, Fenton alone and their combinations were investigated and compared for the degradation and mineralization of chloroacetic acids (CAAs) in aqueous solutions, using a planar falling film reactor. CAAs are widely available in water treated by chlorination processes and are resistance against ozonation in the darkness. The results of the present work showed that the plain ozonation was inefficient method for the destruction of the CAAs as only about 2% degradation was observed after 90\u202fmin treatment. However, the best results were achieved by ozone in combinations with other oxidation processes. Furthermore, a synergistic effect on the removal rate was observed when these processes were exposed to the UVA light. Among the examined processes, combination of photo-Fenton with ozonation was found to be the fastest one for CAAs degradation. The effects of different parameters such as initial concentration of Fe<sup>2</sup>\u207a, H\u2082O\u2082 and CAAs in photo-Fenton combined with ozonation were investigated. The optimum ratio of 0.12 of Fe<sup>2</sup>\u207a/H\u2082O\u2082 concentration was found to give the best result for CAAs degradation. The degree of CAAs mineralization, measured by the total organic carbon removal, as well as the effect of falling liquid film flow rate on the removal of CAAs were also studied and discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
