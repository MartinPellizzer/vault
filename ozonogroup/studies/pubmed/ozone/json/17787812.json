One particularly intense manifestation of this interaction between the radiation belts and the lower atmosphere is the relativistic electron precipitation (REP) event which occurs at subauroral latitudes during magnetospheric substorm activity. At relativistic energies the precipitating electrons produce copious fluxes of energetic bremsstrahlung x-rays, the major portion of which penetrate deep into the stratosphere before undergoing excitation and ionization collisions with the neutral atmosphere. If such REP events occur more than a few percent of the time, they can, on an annual basis, provide a local source of upper stratospheric nitric oxide molecules (via the dissociation of molecular nitrogen) comparable to that from either galactic cosmic rays or energetic solar proton events. Since nitric oxide plays a major role in the removal of stratospheric ozone, it appears that the influence of REP events must also be considered in future photochemical modeling of the terrestrial ozone layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thorne", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17787812", "10.1126/science.195.4275.287", "195/4275/287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
