The routine therapy consisting of intrauterine tetracycline boluses was compared with the administration of ozone foam, both intrauterine therapies without attempts to manually remove the placenta. Cows undergoing caesarean section, suffering from uterine torsion or prolapse of the uterus, and other illnesses than RFM on the first day post-partum were excluded. Values for baseline variables as age, breed, yearly milk yield, parity, pregnancy duration, calving season and number of routine intrauterine treatments were not different between the groups. Number of days with rectal temperature >39.7\u2009\u00b0C within the first 10 days in milk (DIM) were greater in the ozone group. Number of escape therapies were recorded when there was imposing of this therapy as a result of cows having a fever (based on rectal temperature >39.7\u2009\u00b0C) and a significant reduced food intake. Escape therapies consisted of parenteral administration of tetracyclines and NSAIDS during the first 10 DIM. Number of escape therapies, however, was not different between the groups. Results from use of a logistic regression model with fever as a dichotomous variable indicated there was no effect of breed, studbook, type of stall, pasture, business and no effect of age or milk yield. In a second assessment, cows were evaluated until 200 DIM. Results from a survival analysis indicated group (Te/Oz) did not affect rate of culling from the herd."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
