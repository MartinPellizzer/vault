The results indicated that the monitored components were mainly flanges, accounting for 70.23% of the total, and open-ended lines were the components most prone to leaks. The overall percentage of VOCs emissions reduction after the repair was 20.50%, and flanges were the most repairable components, with an average emission reduction of 47.5\u2009kg/a for each flange. In addition, atmospheric predictions were conducted for the VOCs emissions before and after the repair of the components at the research factories. The atmospheric predictions showed that emissions from equipment and facilities have a noticeable impact on VOCs concentration at boundary and the emissions are positively correlated with the pollution source strength. The hazard quotient of the investigated factories was lower than the acceptable risk level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The quantitative assessment of the lifetime cancer risk showed that the risk levels of factories A, C, and D exceeded the EPA's acceptable risk level, and the on-site workers were exposed to inhalation cancer risk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulting Department, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Huitian Environmental Protection Engineering Co., LTD, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulting Department, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulting Department, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Huitian Environmental Protection Engineering Co., LTD, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulting Department, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ziwei", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulting Department, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Huitian Environmental Protection Engineering Co., LTD, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Weinan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consulting Department, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37102223", "10.1080/10934529.2023.2204806"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
