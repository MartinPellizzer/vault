Animals were either given intratracheally with pyrogen-free saline or HCl (pH 1.75) or exposed for 50 h to 100% oxygen before the intragastric application of 1 ml of 50 or 75% ethanol. All rats receiving 50% ethanol were also given 3% monastral blue, 3 min before ethanol administration as a vascular tracer. Lung acid damage and inflammation as assessed by bronchopulmonary lavage were severe. We observed a significant increase in extracellular lactate dehydrogenase beta-glucosaminidase, albumin and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lavage fluid. The number of resident macrophages decreased significantly. Blood gas analysis was not influenced. Hemorrhagic gastric mucosal lesions after 50 or 75% ethanol increased from 4.4 or 8.2% to 9.8 or 13.1% after HCl and from 6.7 or 18.2% to 10.6 or 21.6% of the glandular stomach following oxygen exposure. The area of mucosal vascular damage caused by 50% ethanol as revealed by monastral blue labelling was 3.3 and 2.6 times larger in rats with lung damage induced by HCl or hyperoxia, respectively. Thus, severe lung damage predisposes to microvascular damage and aggravates chemically induced hemorrhagic mucosal lesions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass., USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palitzsch", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brain", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bynum", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szabo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-31029", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Digestion", "NlmUniqueID": "0150472", "ISSNLinking": "0012-2823"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Gastritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia, Aspiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7657045", "10.1159/000201244"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
