The results demonstrated that despite the higher initial disinfectant residue, the increase in bacteria in the conventionally treated and postozonated water was higher than in the water additionally treated with GAC filtration and u.v.-disinfection. Accordingly, a significant decline in assimilable organic carbon in the postozonated water was observed throughout the main, whereas in the GAC-filtered water this decline was shifted to the GAC filters. In the GAC-filtered water the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate was more intense than in postozonated water. The findings confirm that GAC filtration increases the biological stability of drinking water even when treating cold humic waters in which biodegradation is generally limited by phosphorus. However, it appears that biological treatment favours the slow kinetics of nitrifying bacteria, thus allowing nitrification to occur even under cold water conditions in a distribution system."], "CopyrightInformation": "1998 Society of Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Environmental Engineering, Helsinki, Finland. riku.vahala@hut.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vahala", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nieml", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiuru", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laukkanen", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KW8K411A1P", "NameOfSubstance": "chloramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Load"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21182707", "10.1111/j.1365-2672.1998.tb05297.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
