The purpose of the conference was to facilitate exchange of information and to initiate better communication and interaction among scientists, air quality managers, regulators, and others involved in or applying tools (models and measurements to support the modeling efforts) that can be used to develop equitable and effective emissions management practices for attainment of ozone standards. Attendees heard more than 350 presentations from authors representing nearly 30 air quality and meteorological measurement and modeling studies from 18 countries. While the primary emphasis of the conference was technical, two policy sessions were included (Plenary and Concluding Sessions) to place the technical results in perspective with the policy issues. The technical agenda was divided into three subjects: Analysis of Field Measurements (results and interpretation), Modeling (status and results), and Other Topics. Papers presented at the conference are being published in a variety of journals or books to meet the needs of the scientific and policy communities. A complete bibliographical listing of the papers presented at the conference is included with this paper. An unexpected outcome of the conference has been the development of an initiative for continuing the intercomparison of goals and scientific findings from regional air quality studies in Europe and North America, entitled \"Regional Oxidants Programs Intercomparison\" (ROxPIn). This paper will also discuss the goals and objectives of ROxPIn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Pacific Gas and Electric Company , San Ramon , California , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "Paul A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28086294", "10.1080/10473289.1995.10467365"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
