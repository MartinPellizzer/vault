Microwave radiation at 700 W with 14% water content (w/w) achieved approximately 2.5 log inactivation of eggs in soil within 60s. On the other hand, UV irradiation at 3 mW cm(-2) with and without shaking soil for 3600 s achieved approximately 0.32 and 0.01 log inactivation of eggs, respectively. In ozone treatment, 0.13 log inactivation of eggs was achieved with 5.8+/-0.7 mg L(-1) of dissolved ozone dose for 30 min in a continuous diffusion reactor. In addition, the inactivation of eggs by three disinfection techniques was conducted in water in order to compare the inactivation efficiency of eggs in soil. The inactivation efficiency of microwave radiation was found to be no significant difference between in soil and water. However, the inactivation efficiency of UV irradiation was significantly increased in water while in ozone expose there was no significant difference between in soil and water. Microwave treatment thus proved to be the most efficient method in controlling A. lumbricoides eggs in soil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seoul National University, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mun", "ForeName": "Sungmin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Shin-Hyeong", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Tong-Soo", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Byung-Taek", "Initials": "BT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Jeyong", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ascaris"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19674767", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.07.030", "S0045-6535(09)00815-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
