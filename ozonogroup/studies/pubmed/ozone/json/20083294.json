The identification and quantification of BPA in wastewater (WW) and wastewater sludge (WWS) is of major interest to assess the endocrine activity of treated effluent discharged into the environment. Many treatment technologies, including various pre-treatment methods, such as hydrolysis, Fenton oxidation, peroxidation, ultrasonication and ozonation have been developed in order to degrade BPA in WW and WWS and for the production of WWS based value-added products (VAPs). WWS based VAPs, such as biopesticides, bioherbicides, biofertilizers, bioplastics and enzymes are low cost biological alternatives that can compete with chemicals or other cost intensive biological products in the current markets. However, this field application is disputable due to the presence of these organic compounds which has been discussed with a perspective of simultaneous degradation. The pre-treatment produces an impact on rheology as well as value-addition which has been reviewed in this paper. Various analytical techniques available for the detection of BPA in WW and WWS are also discussed. Presence of heavy metals and possible thermodynamical behavior of the compound in WW and WWS can have major impact on BPA removal, which is also included in the review."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRS-ETE, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, 490, Rue de la Couronne, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada G1K 9A9."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohapatra", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brar", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tyagi", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Surampalli", "ForeName": "R Y", "Initials": "RY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MLT3645I99", "NameOfSubstance": "bisphenol A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}], "NumberOfReferences": "253"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20083294", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.12.053", "S0045-6535(09)01476-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
