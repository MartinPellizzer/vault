It remains unknown whether omega-3 fatty acid, or genetic susceptibility of mental disorders modify the impacts of ozone. The aim is to assess the associations of ambient ozone with depression and anxiety, and further explore the potential modification effects of omega-3 fatty acid and genetic susceptibility.", "In total of 257,534 participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010 and followed up to 2016. Depression and anxiety were assessed using mental health questionnaires, primary care records and hospital admission records. The annual average concentrations of ozone were calculated and linked to individuals by home address. Dietary intake and plasma concentration were selected to reflect levels of omega-3 fatty acid. Polygenetic risk scores were selected to reflect genetic susceptibility. We examined the associations of ozone and incident mental disorders, and potential modification of omega-3 fatty acid and genetic susceptibility.", "Incidences of depression (N\u00a0=\u00a06957) and anxiety (N\u00a0=\u00a06944) was associated with increase of ozone. Higher levels of omega-3 fatty acid might attenuate the ozone related depression risk. However, the modification effects of genetic susceptibility were not found.", "Long-term exposure to ambient ozone increase the risk of mental disorders among the middle aged and older adults, and omega-3 fatty acid could reduce the adverse effects of ozone on mental health. Higher intake of omega-3 fatty acid is a potential strategy to prevent the risks caused by ozone on public mental health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
