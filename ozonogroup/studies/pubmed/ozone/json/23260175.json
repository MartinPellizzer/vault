An advanced oxidation process (AOP), wherein the hydroxyl radicals (OH radicals) are generated, is more effective in removing a wider range of OMPs from water than direct ozonation. Second-order rate constants (k(OH) and k(O3) are good indices to estimate the oxidation efficiency, where higher rate constants indicate more rapid oxidation. In this study, quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) models for O(3) and AOP processes were developed, and rate constants, k(OH) and [Formula: see text] , were predicted based on target compound properties. The k(O3) and k(OH) values ranged from 5 * 10(-4) to 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) and 0.04 to 18 * (10(9)) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. Several molecular descriptors which potentially influence O(3) and OH radical oxidation were identified and studied. The QSAR-defining descriptors were double bond equivalence (DBE), ionisation potential (IP), electron-affinity (EA) and weakly-polar component of solvent accessible surface area (WPSA), and the chemical and statistical significance of these descriptors was discussed. Multiple linear regression was used to build the QSAR models, resulting in high goodness-of-fit, r(2) (>0.75). The models were validated by internal and external validation along with residual plots."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
