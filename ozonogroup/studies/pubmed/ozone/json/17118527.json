All experiments were conducted in a bench scale glass column equipped with ceramic diffuser and a lab-scale ozone generator under ambient temperature and pH 7. The decomposition rate of PCP in this study was primarily controlled by the ozone mass transfer rate from gas to liquid phases. Principal intermediates found were 2,3,4,6- and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenols (TeCP) and phenol. PCP seems to be more vulnerable to ozone than its intermediates. A bioluminescence technique was used to evaluate the toxicity of PCP with Vibrio fisheri NRRL B-11177 as the test bacterium, and the EC(50) of PCP was found to be 1.0 mg l(-1). Detoxification occurred as the PCP and TeCP reacted with ozone and decomposed to less chlorinated congeners and phenol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Center for Environmental and Hazardous Waste Management, Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok 10140, Thailand. jin.ano@kmutt.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anotai", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wuttipong", "ForeName": "Rosawan", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Visvanathan", "ForeName": "Chettiyappan", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Manage", "NlmUniqueID": "0401664", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D9BSU0SE4T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentachlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pentachlorophenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Vibrio"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17118527", "10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.10.001", "S0301-4797(06)00306-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
