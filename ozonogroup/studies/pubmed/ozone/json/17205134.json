However the development of high-level resistance in several pest insects threatens the future usage of phosphine; yet research into phosphine resistance mechanisms has been limited due to the potential for human poisoning in enclosed laboratory environments.", "Here we describe a custom-designed chamber for safely containing phosphine gas generated from aluminium phosphide tablets. In an improvement on previous generation systems, this chamber can be completely sealed to control the escape of phosphine. The device has been utilised in a screening program with C. elegans that has identified a phosphine synergist, and quantified the efficacy of a new fumigant against that of phosphine. The phosphine-induced mortality at 20 degrees C has been determined with an LC(50) of 732 ppm. This result was contrasted with the efficacy of a potential new botanical pesticide dimethyl disulphide, which for a 24 hour exposure at 20 degrees C is 600 times more potent than phosphine (LC(50) 1.24 ppm). We also found that co-administration of the glutathione depletor diethyl maleate (DEM) with a sublethal dose of phosphine (70 ppm, <LC(5)), results in a doubling of mortality in C. elegans relative to DEM alone.", "The prohibitive danger associated with the generation, containment, and use of phosphine in a laboratory environment has now been substantially reduced by the implementation of our novel gas generation chamber. We have also identified a novel phosphine synergist, the glutathione depletor DEM, suggesting an effective pathway to be targeted in future synergist research; as well as quantifying the efficacy of a potential alternative to phosphine, dimethyl disulphide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Molecular and Microbial Sciences, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valmas", "ForeName": "Nicholas", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ebert", "ForeName": "Paul R", "Initials": "PR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Maleates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3P8D642K5E", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethyl disulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FW6947296I", "NameOfSubstance": "phosphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G81WQB56OL", "NameOfSubstance": "diethyl maleate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Maleates"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphines"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bengston M, Collins PJ, Daglish GJ, Hallman VL, Kopittke R, et al.
