Sciatic nerve injury was generated by compressing the right sciatic nerve for 90\u00a0s using a Yasargil aneurysm clip in groups SNI and SNI + Ozone. A 70\u00a0\u00b5g/ml concentration of ozone was given four times (once a day at 1st, 24th, 48th, and 72th\u00a0h) at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg/kg to groups O and SNI + Ozone after injury by an intraperitoneal injection. Nerve conduction velocities of all rats were measured by in vivo electrophysiological tests at the end of the day 4. Then, plasma malondialdehyde, total oxidant and antioxidant status were measured and also axonal and myelin changes in sciatic nerves of histopathological examination were performed. The data were analyzed by Kolmogorov Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Chi square test. p <.05 was considered statistically significant.", "The proximal and distal latency difference were higher and nerve conduction velocity were lower in SNI group than C and O groups, and the myelin structure was found to be broken in group SNI compared to groups C and O. However, the amplitude of the compound action potential, the nerve conduction velocity were significantly higher in group SNI + Ozone than in group SNI. Moreover, myelin injury was significantly lower in group SNI + Ozone compared to group SNI. Total oxidant status in group SNI was significantly higher than in groups C, O, and SNI + Ozone. But, total antioxidant status in group SNI was significantly lower than in groups C, O, and SNI + Ozone.", "This study showed that the administration of ozone at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg/kg after peripheral nerve injury in rats reduces myelin and axonal injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u0131z\u0131lay", "ForeName": "Zahir", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kahraman \u00c7etin", "ForeName": "Nesibe", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physiology , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aksel", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Biochemistry , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abas", "ForeName": "Bur\u00e7in \u0130rem", "Initials": "B\u0130"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akta\u015f", "ForeName": "Serdar", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Balikesir University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physiology , Balikesir , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erken", "ForeName": "Haydar Ali", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Top\u00e7u", "ForeName": "Abdullah", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Y\u0131lmaz", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Biochemistry , Aydin , Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yenisey", "ForeName": "Cigdem", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "8809255", "ISSNLinking": "0894-1939"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Axons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myelin Sheath"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peripheral Nerve Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Sciatic Nerve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28925753", "10.1080/08941939.2017.1369606"]}}]}
