Now the time spent at home is considerable, around 80%. Aerocontaminants are of chemical, biological or particulate nature. Amongst asthmatics, internal NO2 is capable of producing an asthmatic crisis, perhaps by a direct effect of the pollutant and perhaps by potentiation of the bronchial response to the allergen. COV and formaldehyde may have a bronchial effect on asthmatics, at significant levels that are rarely found in a domestic environment. Endotoxins present in domestic dust may also be a serious co-factor in asthmatics who are allergic to mites. Concerning allergens, identification and quantification of immunodominant proteins of the principal pneumoallergens of the internal environment has emphasized the great diversity of levels, and given a comparison of the link between the level of allergen in the air and dust, and the development of the sensitization of a predisposed subject. Measurement of the aerodynamic behaviour of pneumoallergens has led to a better understanding of the physiology of allergic asthma. Nevertheless it is appropriate to follow the work that tries to assess the relative importance of each of these factors, both in allergic sensitization and in the clinical response to the allergen. Understanding the respective roles played by the different domestic pollutants should allow an improvement in diagnosis and treatment of pathologies that are linked to the domestic environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie, H\u00f4pital Lyautey, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, INSERM U425."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Blay", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lieutier-Colas", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "La pollution domestique (en dehors du tabac)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Allerg Immunol (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "0245775", "ISSNLinking": "0397-9148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}], "NumberOfReferences": "12"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10572582"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
