Three mopeds with different engine types (carburetor, direct injection, and electronic carburetion system ECS) where investigated by applying two different driving cycles, the legislative cycle ECE47 and the worldwide motorcycle test cycle WMTC. Thereby, particulate matter (PM), regulated compounds, carbonyls, volatile hydrocarbons (VOC), and particle-associated polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were analyzed and ozone formation potentials (OFP) as well as toxicity equivalents (TEQ) determined. The ECE47 emission factors for almost all species and moped types were much higher in the nonregulated, prior cold phase than in the hot phase, which is considered for legislation. Great differences for the mopeds could be observed for NO(x), VOC, and PM, whereas discrepancies between the driving cycles ECE47 and WMTC were smaller. In addition, a positive influence on exhaust composition caused by technical modifications of the ECS engine was determined. Results indicate that regulation of total hydrocarbons (THC) alone might not be sufficient to regulate PM, especially for direct injection engines. Moreover, recommendations for a revised future test protocol are demonstrated and discussed, whereby the cold phase and the hot phase are taken into account."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EC Joint Research Centre Ispra, Institute for Environment and Sustainability, Transport and Air Quality Unit, 21027 Ispra (VA), Italy. dr-thomas-adam@gmx.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adam", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farfaletti", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montero", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martini", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manfredi", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larsen", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santi", "ForeName": "G De", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krasenbrink", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Astorga", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19928903", "10.1021/es9021969"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
