Performance assessment performed with artificial HP solution by varying initial pH and employing various oxidation processes clearly showed that the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u2500Fe(II) two-step oxidation process possessed the highest removal efficiency when operating under the same conditions. The effects of O<sub>3</sub> dosing, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, Fe(II) addition and Fe(II) feeding time on the removal efficiency of HP were further evaluated in terms of apparent kinetic rate constant. Under improved conditions (initial HP concentration of 50\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, 75\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub>, 1\u00a0mL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 150\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Fe(II) and pH 7.0), standard discharge (<0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in China) could be achieved, and the Fe(II) feeding time was found to be the limiting factor for the evolution of apparent kinetic rate constant in the second stage. Characterization studies showed that neutralization process after oxidation treatment favored the improvement of phosphorus removal due to the formation of more metal hydroxides. Moreover, as a comparison with lab-scale Fenton approach, the O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u2500Fe(II) oxidation process had more competitive advantages with respect to applicable pH range, removal efficiency, sludge production as well as economic costs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
