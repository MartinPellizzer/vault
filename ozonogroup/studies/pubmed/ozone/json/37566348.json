On the basis of O<sub>3</sub> isopleths from a series of air quality simulations under different levels of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission reductions, we found that such concerns are not necessary. As NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions have been reduced in recent years for particulate matter control, future NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reductions are generally favorable for summertime maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> reductions. Decreases in summertime O<sub>3</sub> due to NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reductions will also lead to lower atmospheric oxidation capacity, characterized by decreased OH and NO<sub>3</sub> concentrations, resulting in further reduction of secondary inorganic aerosols (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium ion, NSA) formation. VOC emission reductions help to further reduce MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> and are needed to control HCHO and primary air toxics simultaneously, but they are ineffective in reducing NSA. This study indicates that a nationwide NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emission reduction policy has great potential in controlling O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> simultaneously. However, its effectiveness could be greatly reduced when applied on a limited spatial scale."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 American Chemical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Mingjie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-3136, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1797-2311"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hongliang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4560-433X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-3136, United States."}], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101628367"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no competing financial interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "19"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37566348", "10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00036"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
