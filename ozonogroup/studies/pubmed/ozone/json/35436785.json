Viable particles are living microorganisms, whereas non-viable particles do not contain microorganisms but act as transport for viable particles. The effectiveness of ozone in reducing these particles in a non-controlled room and a controlled cleanroom using high-efficiency particles air (HEPA) filter was analyzed in this study.", "\u2003Viable particles and non-viable particles sized 0.5 and 5 \u03bcm were quantified before and after ozonation in two different health environments: non-controlled (group 1) and controlled area, which was associated with a HEPA filtering system (group 2). Active air sampling using a MAS 100 was used to count the number of viable particles, while the number of non-viable particles/m<sup>3</sup> was obtained following the manufacturer's recommendations of the Lasair III 310C system.", "\u2003Our results of the viable particles counting were not quantifiable and analyzed using statistical tests. Both groups showed a slight tendency to reduce the number of viable particles after ozonation of the environmental air. A statistically significant reduction of non-viable 5 \u03bcm particles after ozonation was observed in both groups (G1: <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,009; G2: <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,002). Reduction in the non-viable 0.5 \u03bcm particles after ozonation was observed only in group 2, associated with the HEPA filter. In group 1, after ozonation, a significant increase in 0.5 \u03bcm particles was observed, probably due to the breaking of 5 \u03bcm particles by ozone gas. Our results suggest that ozone gas can break 5 \u03bcm particles and, when associated with a HEPA filter, increases its effectiveness in removing 0.5 \u03bcm particles.", "\u2003Considering that 5 \u03bcm particles are important in the air transport of microorganisms, their reduction in the environment can be a relevant parameter in controlling the dissemination of infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "The Author(s).
