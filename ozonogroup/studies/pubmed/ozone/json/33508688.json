Membrane prepared using aluminosilicate composites have the following disadvantages: large mean pore size and low mechanical strength. To address these limitations, flat microfiltration membranes were fabricated using SiO<sub>2</sub> powder and aluminosilicate composite as raw materials. The membrane performance was optimized by regulating the particle size of SiO<sub>2</sub>, the ratio of SiO<sub>2</sub> to aluminosilicate composite (s/a), and the type of chemical admixture. The X-ray diffraction results indicated that the crystalline SiO<sub>2</sub> particles were favorable for the preparation of membranes with higher bending strengths. The decreasing particle sizes of SiO<sub>2</sub> (1.33-0.15\u00a0\u03bcm) decreased the pore size distribution. The bending strength of the membrane reduced with an increase in s/a, while was effectively enhanced by adding dissolved Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>. The optimized inorganic microfiltration membrane could also catalyze ozone to remove 100% of benzophenone-4 with an initial concentration of 10\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> within 15\u00a0min, and TOC removal by 52.67%. This paper presents a revised method for preparing an inorganic microfiltration membrane, which is an increasingly promising material for water treatment because of its low cost, low energy consumption, and high catalytic performance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
