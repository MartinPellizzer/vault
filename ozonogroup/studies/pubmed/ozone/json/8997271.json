Similar rates of distribution of salicylic acid in plasma and to the lungs were observed among air control animals of all age groups. Levels of 2,3-DHBA were about twice as high in the lungs of air control senescent rats compared with juvenile and adult rats (P < 0.05). Exposure to ozone resulted in 1.5- to 2-fold elevation of 2,3-DHBA in lungs and plasma of all age groups (P < 0.05), whereas levels of 2,5-DHBA were not changed significantly. There was no effect of age on the magnitude of 2,3-DHBA increase in the lungs or plasma after ozone exposure. The postulated source of .OH is chemical reduction of H2O2, which could be generated from increased age-dependent endogenous oxidant production or the age-independent reaction of ozone or macrophage-derived oxidants with the surfactant lining."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Occupational Toxicology Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumarathasan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu\u00e9nette", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vincent", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O414PZ4LPZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salicylic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8997271", "10.1152/ajplung.1996.271.6.L995"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
