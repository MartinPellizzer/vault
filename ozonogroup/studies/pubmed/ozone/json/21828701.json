A UV-assisted micromolding technique is used to create a microtexture with an ultraviolet (UV)-curable resin containing Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles. A subsequent treatment of ultraviolet ozone (UVO) leads to the formation of nanoscale roughness over the as-formed microstructured surface, resulting in a dual-scale surface texture similar to a lotus leaf, in a reproducible manner. After hydrophobization with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) in the liquid phase, this hierarchical surface exhibits stable superhydrophobic characteristics, having a water contact angle close to 160\u00b0 and a contact angle (CA) hysteresis as low as 1\u00b0. These characteristics did not change even after exposure to ambient conditions for 6\u00a0months."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-744, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Se-Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "Kahp Y", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hong H", "Initials": "HH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21828701", "10.1088/0957-4484/19/27/275305", "S0957-4484(08)74912-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
