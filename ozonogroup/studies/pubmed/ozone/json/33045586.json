When compared to control, Cripps Pink fruit fumigated with BC and NC exhibited significantly lowest ethylene production and respiration, whilst the Granny Smith fruit treated with 1-MCP exhibited lowest ethylene production followed by NC and BC treatments. Application of ozone in cold storage maintained higher levels of sugars but elevated ethylene production in both the apple cultivars. No significant interaction was recorded between ethylene antagonists and ozone application in cold storage on the ethylene production, respiration and other fruit quality parameters. In conclusion, results suggest that BC and NC are potential ethylene antagonists in Cripps Pink and Granny Smith apples during the cold storage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
