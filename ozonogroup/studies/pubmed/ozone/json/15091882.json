The composition of the terpenes was found to be similar in the emissions from various parts of the process as well as in the mill plume. The bicyclic terpenes alpha-pinene and 3-carene, originating principally from wood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), predominated among the thirteen assessed hydrocarbon monoterpenes. Terpinolene was the most prominent among the particularly reactive terpenes with a lifetime in ozone-rich air of only a few minutes. The rapid formation of photooxidants by chemical reactions of the terpenes with other components of the mill plume is discussed. It is concluded that a variety of phytotoxic photooxidants are formed which may contribute significantly to forest decline within 50 km of mills located along coasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Environmental Science, Chalmers University of Technology, 412 96 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Str\u00f6mvall", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petersson", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091882", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90093-4", "0269749193900934"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
