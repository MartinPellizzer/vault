Disposal of this waste is costly, in part because the high oil content requires use of secure disposal methods akin to handling of hazardous wastes. This article examines the properties of oily sludge and evaluates optional methods for reducing the oil content of this sludge to enable use of lower cost disposal methods. To reduce the oil content or break the structure of oily sludge, preliminary lab-scale experiments involving mechanical treatment, surfactant extraction, and oxidation are conducted. By applying surfactants, approximately 36% to 45% of oils are extracted from oily sludge. Of this, about 33% of oils are rapidly oxidised via radiation by an electron beam within 10\u2009s of exposure. The Fenton reaction is effective for destruction of oily sludge. It is also found that 56% of oils were removed by reacting oily sludge with water containing ozone of 0.5\u2009mg\u2009l(-1) over a period of 24\u2009h. Oxidation using ozone thus can also be effectively used as a pretreatment for oily sludge."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Transportation Environmental Research Team, Korea Railroad Research Institute, Gyeonggi-Do, Republic of Korea klez@krri.re.kr."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Tae-Soon", "Initials": "TS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Transportation Environmental Research Team, Korea Railroad Research Institute, Gyeonggi-Do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jae-Young", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9881064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26261236", "10.1177/0734242X15597776", "0734242X15597776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
