This all-solid-state laser provides a compact, robust, and highly reliable laser transmitter for potential application in differential absorption lidar measurements of atmospheric ozone. Two compact, high-energy-pulsed, and injection-seeded Ti:sapphire lasers operating at a pulse repetition frequency of 30 Hz and wavelengths of 867 and 900 nm, with M2 of 1.3, have been experimentally demonstrated and their properties compared with model results. The output pulse energy was 115 mJ at 867 nm and 105 mJ at 900 nm, with a slope efficiency of 40% and 32%, respectively. At these energies, the beam quality was good enough so that we were able to achieve 30 mJ of ultraviolet laser output at 289 and 300 nm after frequency tripling with two lithium triborate nonlinear crystals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia 23529, USA. kelsayed@ccny.cuny.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsayed", "ForeName": "Khaled A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeYoung", "ForeName": "Russell J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petway", "ForeName": "Larry B", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "William C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "James C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsayed-Ali", "ForeName": "Hani E", "Initials": "HE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14658468", "10.1364/ao.42.006650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
