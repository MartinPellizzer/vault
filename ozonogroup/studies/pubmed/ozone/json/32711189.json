The deposition velocity of ozone onto human surfaces strongly affects the indoor ozone concentration, and the production of oxidation products. In this study, we measured the deposition velocity of ozone onto human surfaces in six Chinese residential rooms, each housing 1-3 occupants. In addition, we estimated the corresponding emission rate of oxidation products. The measured mean value of the deposition velocity is 14.8 (\u00b110.1) m/h, which is close to those reported in earlier studies in western countries. We also find that the ozone deposition velocity onto human surfaces is positively correlated to the weighted duration from the last laundry and bath/facial-cleansing, and it is negatively correlated to the relative humidity of the indoor air. The estimated emission rates of 6-MHO, 4-OPA, acetone, geranyl acetone, 1,4-butanedial decanal, and all gas-phase products are 7.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>16</sup>, 6.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>16</sup>, 9.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>16</sup>, 9.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>15</sup>, 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>16</sup>, 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>16</sup>, and 4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>17</sup> molecule per person h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with an indoor ozone concentration of 5\u00a0ppb\u00a0at steady state. The measured deposition velocity of ozone onto human surfaces of Chinese residents, and the emission rates of the corresponding oxidation products may be applied for the estimation of human exposure to ozone and its oxidation products in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
