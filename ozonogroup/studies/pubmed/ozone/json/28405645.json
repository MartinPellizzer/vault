These effects are potentially important for better understanding the chemistry of interstellar and planetary bodies, which are exposed to cosmic radiation and the solar wind, respectively; however, modeling such collisions on a detailed microscopic basis has thus far been largely unsuccessful. To that end, a new model, entitled CIRIS: the Chemistry of Ionizing Radiation in Solids, was created to calculate the physical and chemical effects of the irradiation of solid materials. With the new code, we simulate O<sub>2</sub> ice irradiated with 100 keV protons. Our models are able to reproduce the measured ozone abundances of a previous experimental study, as well as independently predict the approximate thickness of the ice used in that work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, P.
