It is thought that the molecular basis for the protective action of phenylpropanoids in plants is their antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. These numerous phenolic compounds are major biologically active components of human diet, spices, aromas, wines, beer, essential oils, propolis, and traditional medicine. Last few years, much interest has been attracted to natural and synthetic phenylpropanoids for medicinal use as antioxidant, UV screens, anticancer, anti-virus, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, and antibacterial agents. They are of great interest for cosmetic and perfume industries as active natural ingredients. In the present review, the metabolic pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants and the mechanism of phenylpropanoid-mediated plant defense are described. Learning from plants, free radical-driven, molecular and cellular processes modulated by phenylpropanoids in human cell cultures in vitro and in the in vivo animal models of tumors, inflammation, and cellular damage are also reviewed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, Rome, Italy. l.korkina@idi.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korkina", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogen Receptor Modulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytoprotection"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Receptor Modulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "NumberOfReferences": "106"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17519109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
