We found that the daily maximum 8-hour averages <i>\u03c6</i>(O<sub>3</sub>) were (103.0\u00b114.5)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. The average <i>\u03c6</i>(NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) and <i>\u03c6</i>(VOCs), which are ozone precursors, were (16.7\u00b111.3)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>and (22.4\u00b19.4)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, respectively. The \u00b7OH reactivity of VOCs was determined (9.6\u00b13.8) s<sup>-1</sup>. Ji'nan suffered from serious O<sub>3</sub> pollution. An observation-constrained chemical box model was deployed to evaluate in situ photochemical O<sub>3</sub> production, which indicated that chemical reactions made positive contributions to O<sub>3</sub> production rates between 07:00 and 19:00 LT, with the average hourly O<sub>3</sub> production rate of 35.6\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. To evaluate the effectiveness of various ozone precursor control strategies in reducing ozone pollution, we combined the observation-based model (OBM) with the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) method. The key indicators that affect the local ozone production rate were identified. Ji'nan was under VOC-limited conditions and the key VOC precursors were alkenes. The O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanism changed from the VOC-limited regime in the morning to the transitional regime in the afternoon. Correspondingly, the simulated local O<sub>3</sub> production rate was increased from 18.3\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> to 29.6\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. To further explore the role of anthropogenic emissions in ozone pollution, we used the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to identify the major sources contributing to VOCs. The major sources in Ji'nan were vehicular exhaust and gasoline evaporation, accounting for more than 50% of the observed VOCs. Therefore, constraints on vehicular emissions is the most effective strategy to control O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Ji'nan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao 266237, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Heng-Qing", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Ming-Yue", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-Juan", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hong-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Guo-Lan", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Hua-Lin", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qing-Song", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ji'nan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Da-Qiu", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Water Conservancy and Environment, University of Ji'nan, Ji'nan 250024, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laoling Branch of Dezhou Ecological Environment Bureau, Laoling 253600, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li-Na", "Initials": "LN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35075842", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202106068"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
