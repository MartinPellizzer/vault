The results showed that the SVR model had the best prediction performance on MDA8-O<sub>3</sub> during the whole year, the coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) reached 0.86, and the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were 16.3 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 12.3 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The prediction performance of the SVR model in autumn was still slightly better than that of LG and MLP, with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>,RMSE,and MAE values of 0.88, 19.8 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>,and 16.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The RF model performed the worst in the autumn prediction. In addition, the models trained by data from the whole year had better prediction ability on autumn MDA8-O<sub>3</sub> than that of those only trained by autumn data, and the <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> differed 0.08-0.14."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Run", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Information Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jun", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38216453", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202302044"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
