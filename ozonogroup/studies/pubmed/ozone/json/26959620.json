The medical ozone theraphy was administered intraperitonealy for three weeks in group 3 while the other rats received saline injection. At the twenty second day serum were obtained for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the colonic burst pressures were measured and colonic tissue samples were obtained for MDA and MPO levels.
