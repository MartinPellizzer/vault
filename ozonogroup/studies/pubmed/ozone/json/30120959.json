There is also an unmet need for effective low-temperature sterilization techniques that have a clear pathway for U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. Here, we report the results of our investigation of a novel argon plasma-activated gas (PAG) for disinfection and potentially sterilization of biofilm-contaminated endoscopic channels.", "Test polytetrafluoroethylene channel segments were contaminated with 4-, 24- and 48-hour luminal biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli and were treated by PAG flowing for up to 9 minutes. After PAG treatment, inactivation and dispersal of luminal bacterial biofilms and their regrowth in 48 hours were evaluated. Reactive species induced by PAG were measured with colorimetric probes and electron spin resonance spectrometry. Surface morphology and elemental composition of PAG-treated channel material were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy.", "PAG treatment for 9 minutes led to more than 8 log reduction of viable cells and dispersal of 24- and 48-hour luminal biofilms of all 3 bacteria and to suppression of their regrowth, whereas it resulted in little morphologic abnormalities in channel material. Ozone concentration of PAG fell to below .01 ppm within 30 seconds of switching off the plasma. PAG-treated deionized water was acidified with numerous types of reactive species, each with a concentration some 3 orders of magnitude or more below its bacterial inhibition concentration.", "PAG is capable of effectively and rapidly disinfecting luminal bacterial biofilms and offers an alternative to the step of HLDs and/or ethylene oxide in the endoscope reprocessing procedure with safety to personnel and environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
