encephalopathy in burns. <b>Methods:</b> The retrospective cohort study was conducted. From August 2015 to May 2019, 90 patients with burn septic encephalopathy and conforming to the inclusion criteria were admitted to Zhengzhou First People's Hospital. Forty-six patients (25 males and 21 females, aged (35\u00b14) years ) treated with Xingnaojing were included in Xingnaojing alone group, and forty-four patients (20 males and 24 females, aged (34\u00b15) years) treated with medical ozone autologous blood transfusion combined with Xingnaojing were included in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group. Heart rate, body temperature, mean arterial pressure, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation \u2161(APACHE\u2161) score and Glasgow coma score (GCS) of patients in 2 groups were recorded before treatment and on 7 d after treatment. The blood-brain barrier injury markers including occludin, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), central nervous system specific protein S100\u03b2, glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP), and excitatory amino acid (EAA) in serum of patients in 2 groups were detected before treatment and on 1, 3, and 7 d after treatment. Computer tomography perfusion imaging for brain was performed in patients of 2 groups to calculate the region of interest cerebral blood flow (rCBF), region of interest blood volume (rCBV), and region of interest mean transit time (rMTT) before treatment and on 1, 3, and 7 d after treatment. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-square test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, independent sample <i>t</i> test, and Bonferroni correction. <b>Results:</b> On 7 d after treatment, heart rate, body temperature, and mean arterial pressure of patients in 2 groups were decreased compared with those before treatment, heart rate of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group was obviously higher than that in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t</i>=2.886, <i>P</i><0.01), body temperature of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group was obviously lower than that in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t</i>=5.020, <i>P</i><0.01), and mean arterial pressure of patients in 2 groups were close (<i>t</i>=0.472, <i>P</i>>0.05). On 7 d after treatment, APACHE\u2161 score of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group was obviously lower than that in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t=</i>3.797, <i>P</i><0.01), and GCS of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group was obviously higher than that in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t=</i>4.934, <i>P</i><0.01). On 3 and 7 d after treatment, the levels of occludin, NOS, NSE, S100\u03b2, GFAP, and EAA in serum of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group were significantly lower than those in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t</i>=2.100, 2.090, 2.691, 2.013, 2.474, 2.635, 2.225, 4.011, 3.150, 2.691, 3.145, 2.781, <i>P</i><0.05 or <i>P</i><0.01). On 1, 3, and 7 d after treatment, rCBF and rCBV of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group were significantly increased compared with those in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t</i>=3.127, 3.244, 3.883, 7.274, 3.661, 2.777, <i>P</i><0.01). On 7 d after treatment, rMTT of patients in ozone autologous blood transfusion+Xingnaojing group was (3.02\u00b10.57) s, which was significantly lower than (3.11\u00b11.20) s in Xingnaojing alone group (<i>t</i>=2.409, <i>P</i><0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Transfusion of medical ozone autologous blood combined with Xingnaojing therapy can effectively relieve brain injury and improve cerebral blood perfusion in patients with burn septic encephalopathy, which is with safety and credibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "X L", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y G", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "H T", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "X K", "Initials": "XK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Burns, Zhengzhou First People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450004, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2018020728", "Agency": "Medical Science and Technology Project of Henan Province of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "100959418", "ISSNLinking": "1009-2587"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "xingnaojing"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Transfusion, Autologous"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "58"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34139826", "10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20200330-00204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
