In this study, the dose responses for urinary AcPrCys and S-propylcysteine (PrCys) adducts on globin and neurofilaments were determined as a function of 1-BP exposure level and duration in the rat; and globin PrCys adducts and urinary AcPrCys were quantified in samples obtained from workers in a 1-BP production facility. Rats were exposed to 1-BP by inhalation for 2 weeks at 0, 50, 200, or 800 ppm and to 1-BP at 0 or 50 ppm for 4 weeks. After the 4-week exposures ended, half of the animals were euthanized immediately and half euthanized 8 days later. Urinary AcPrCys was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC/MS); and PrCys adducts were determined on globin and neurofilaments using LC/MS/MS. In rats, PrCys adduct and urinary AcPrCys levels demonstrated a linear dose response relative to exposure level. PrCys globin adducts demonstrated a linear cumulative dose response over the 4-week exposure period. Elimination of AcPrCys appeared biphasic with detectable levels still present in urine up to 8 days postexposure. A significant increase in globin PrCys adducts was observed in the 1-BP workers relative to control workers; and urinary AcPrCys increased with increasing 1-BP ambient exposure levels. The results of these studies demonstrate the ability of 1-BP to covalently modify proteins in vivo and support the potential of urinary AcPrCys and globin PrCys adducts to serve as biomarkers of 1-BP exposure in humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-2561, USA. holly.valentine@vanderbilt.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valentine", "ForeName": "Holly", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amarnath", "ForeName": "Kalyani", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amarnath", "ForeName": "Venkataraman", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Weihua", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Xuncheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valentine", "ForeName": "William M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichihara", "ForeName": "Gaku", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES06387-8", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P30 ES00267", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "N-acetyl-S-propylcysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "65309-79-7", "NameOfSubstance": "S-propylcysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-22-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Globins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9746DNE68", "NameOfSubstance": "1-bromopropane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Globins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17517825", "10.1093/toxsci/kfm126", "kfm126"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
