During five sampling campaigns, we measured N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from a 0.53\u00a0ha off-stream CW treating nitrate-rich water from the intensively fertilized watershed in Rampillon, France, using automated chambers with a quantum cascade laser system, and manual chambers. Sediment samples were analysed for potential N<sub>2</sub> flux using the HeO<sub>2</sub> incubation method. Both inlet nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations and N<sub>2</sub>O emission varied significantly between the seasons. In the Autumn and Winter inlet concentrations were about 11\u00a0mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and\u00a0<\u00a06.5\u00a0mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in the Spring and Summer. N<sub>2</sub>O emission was highest in the Autumn (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error: 9.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0N\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>) and lowest in the Summer (wet period: 0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0N\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>). The CW was a very weak source of N<sub>2</sub>O emitting 0.32\u00a0kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> and removing around 938\u00a0kg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, the ratio of N<sub>2</sub>O-N emitted to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N removed was 0.033%. The automated and manual chambers gave similar results. From the potential N<sub>2</sub>O formation in the sediment, only 9% was emitted to the atmosphere, the average N<sub>2</sub> N <sub>2</sub>O ratio was high: 89:1 for N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>potential</sub>: N<sub>2</sub>O-N<sub>potential</sub> and 1353:1 for N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>potential</sub>: N<sub>2</sub>O-N<sub>emitted</sub>. These results indicate complete denitrification. The focused principal component analysis showed strong positive correlation between the gaseous N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and the following environmental factors: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N concentrations in inlet water, streamflow, and nitrate reduction rate. Water temperature, TOC and DOC in the water and hydraulic residence time showed negative correlations with N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Shallow off-stream CWs such as Rampillon may have good nitrate removal capacity with low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
