This causes the phenomena of haze and photochemical smog pollution. Recently, the leak detection and repair (LDAR) program was required to implement in China's petroleum industry on the background of the huge emissions from equipment leaks. This paper analyzed and compared the application of LDAR program in four petroleum refineries and six typical processing units in these refineries. The results showed that non-flanged connectors, flanges, valves, and open-ended lines were the most common components, which accounted for over 99% in these refineries. And over half were non-flanged connectors. About 0.2% to 0.4% of all components were found to leak and emitted up to 91.8% of VOCs, especially the leaking valves and open-ended lines. And over 88.5% of VOC emissions were from high leaking components. The VOC emissions reduced 42% to 57% by repairing 42% to 81% of leaking components. And 90% of the reduction was achieved by repairing high leaking components. Besides, under the same processing capacity, the gas fractionation unit and continuous catalytic reforming unit have a higher average number of components, leaking components and VOC emissions than the other four units. Finally, this paper proposed some problems and suggestions during the implementation of LDAR program. These findings can enhance and improve the effectiveness of LDAR program, and establish a comprehensive VOCs control system, which provides a scientific basis and technical support for the government and refineries. <i>Implications:</i> Recently, China required industries to implement leak detection and repair (LDAR) program to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, especially the petroleum industry. In this paper, we analyzed and compared the LDAR program implementation in four refineries and six typical processing units in these refineries. The results indicate that the implementation of LDAR program was highly effective in petroleum industry. The comparison helps us to enhance the effectiveness of LDAR program by locating the high VOC emission components and units, which provides technical support for the government and refineries in developing specific regulations and plans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China) , Qingdao, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China) , Qingdao, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China) , Qingdao, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dongfeng", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Government Programs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32663111", "10.1080/10962247.2020.1772407"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
