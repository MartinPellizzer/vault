The results indicated that glycine, serine, and threonine were the key identified amino acids correlated with parameters related to sludge dewaterability. To be exemplified, glycine showed positive correlations with the normalized CST (regression coefficient (R)\u00a0=\u00a00.72, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), the normalized SRF (R\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), PN in soluble EPS (R\u00a0=\u00a00.89, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), PS in soluble EPS (R\u00a0=\u00a00.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), tryptophan-like PN in soluble EPS (R\u00a0=\u00a00.60, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and tryptophan-like PN in loosely-bound EPS (R\u00a0=\u00a00.58, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After adding extra glycine, serine, and threonine into sludge samples, sludge dewaterability was deteriorated. The hydrophilic functional groups of CO and C-OH were found to be more predominant in sludge with the presence of these amino acids. The Lewis acid-base interaction predominated in determining the net attraction among sludge flocs. Moreover, the presence of glycine, serine, and threonine resulted in high repulsive hydrophilic interaction, which deteriorated sludge dewaterability. This study emphasized the importance of amino acids in sludge dewatering and amino acids might be incorporated into parameters reflecting sludge dewaterability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
