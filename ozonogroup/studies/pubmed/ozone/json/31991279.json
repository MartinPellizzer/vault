Due to low biodegradability in conventional waste water treatment plants, it is currently incinerated. Thus, new pre-treatment methods for rivaroxaban-containing waste water could facilitate its subsequent biological processing. In this study, ozonation was investigated as the pre-treatment method, with special emphasis on the elimination of the target compound and the generation of its main transformation products. These were determined by high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Our results show that the concentration of rivaroxaban in the ozonated waste water can be effectively reduced (below detection limit) under acidic conditions, whereas neutral or basic reaction environment proved less suitable. Four main transformation products were identified and their concentrations determined. Rivaroxaban and its most prominent transformation product acetoxamide were elucidated in multiple-stage mass spectrometry (MS<sup>n</sup>) experiments. Transformation products derived from the degradation of rivaroxaban were then compared to its natural (animal and human) metabolites as well as other known derivatives. In contrast to previously published rivaroxaban-derived metabolites, the presented ozonation experiments resulted in new transformation products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
