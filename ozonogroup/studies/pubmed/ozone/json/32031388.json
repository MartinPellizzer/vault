Steroids represent a challenging biomolecular class for ion mobility (IM) separations due to their structural rigidity and subtle stereochemical differences. In this work, we compare the effects of ozonolysis on the relative mobilities of a model stereoisomer pair, testosterone and epitestosterone. A solution-phase ozonolysis approach is used due to its simplicity, relatively low cost, and potential for rapid, online analysis. Despite the presence of solvent-based addition products, we observe that these steroids undergo an ozone-based cleavage resulting in unique, stable gas-phase conformations. The resulting resolution between testosterone and epitestosterone, with collision cross section values of 176.6 and 193.3 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, respectively, demonstrates a significant improvement in comparison with previous IM-based approaches. The significantly smaller conformation observed for epitestosterone is stabilized by a three-point interaction between the oxygen-containing functional groups and a sodium ion; this same conformation cannot be sterically achieved by testosterone. Identification of this specific structural difference is strengthened by experimental results showing the disappearance of this conformation following in-source water loss, which eliminates the potential for that three-point interaction. Computational modeling of the lowest energy gas-phase structures for these ozone products corroborates the experimental results. In conclusion, this approach provides tremendous potential as a rapid IM separation method for steroid isomers and other endocyclic C\u2550C double bond containing molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Program, Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences , Florida Institute of Technology , Melbourne , Florida 32901 , United States."}], "LastName": "Maddox", "ForeName": "Samuel W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Program, Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences , Florida Institute of Technology , Melbourne , Florida 32901 , United States."}], "LastName": "Fraser Caris", "ForeName": "Robert H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Program, Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences , Florida Institute of Technology , Melbourne , Florida 32901 , United States."}], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "Kristie L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Program, Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences , Florida Institute of Technology , Melbourne , Florida 32901 , United States."}], "LastName": "Burkus-Matesevac", "ForeName": "Aurora", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7774-9923"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Program, Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences , Florida Institute of Technology , Melbourne , Florida 32901 , United States."}], "LastName": "Peverati", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1416-1812"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Program, Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences , Florida Institute of Technology , Melbourne , Florida 32901 , United States."}], "LastName": "Chouinard", "ForeName": "Christopher D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Soc Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9010412", "ISSNLinking": "1044-0305"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32031388", "10.1021/jasms.9b00058"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
