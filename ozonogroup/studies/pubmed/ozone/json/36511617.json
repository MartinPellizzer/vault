This study explored the treatment of coking wastewater using a combination of ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>), ultraviolet (UV), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) process expressed by % chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, % total organic carbon (TOC), % UV<sub>254</sub>, % fluorescence intensity removal and its electrical energy consumption. The obtained results demonstrated that, the combination of O<sub>3</sub>, UV, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which is denoted by O<sub>3</sub>/UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in this study achieved great success in COD removal (92.08%), TOC removal (78.25%), and reduction of fluorescence intensity (99.82%). Compared with the O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/UV processes, O<sub>3</sub>/UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> improved the COD removal by approximately 54-69% and 38-51%, respectively. In addition, the energy consumption was reduced by 53-67%. The TOC removal rate in the effluent ranged 71% and 83%, while the UV<sub>254</sub> removal rate was up to 90%. The fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the O<sub>3</sub>/UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> combination process reduced the fluorescence intensity by almost 97% within 10 min. Furthermore, the total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentration in the effluent was less than 10\u03bcg/L (removal efficiency\u2009>\u200980%) and the most toxic benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was less than 0.03\u2005\u03bcg/L (0.018\u03bcg/L). In addition, the energy consumption of the O<sub>3</sub>/UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process was 53-67% lower than those of O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/UV processes. Furthermore, the energy consumption was 80.26\u2005kWh m<sup>-3</sup> after 60 min of reaction time when the COD (69.3 mg/L) met the standard discharge. Finally, the O<sub>3</sub>/UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process could be an effective method for improving the mineralisation of refractory organic matter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Yuxian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunrong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiaoya", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianbing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing), Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Qingbang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coke"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36511617", "10.1080/09593330.2022.2158759"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
