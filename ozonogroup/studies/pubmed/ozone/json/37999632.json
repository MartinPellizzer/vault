The results showed that superoxide species (O<sub>2</sub><sup><i>\u03b4</i>-</sup>), which directly interacted with Cu, formed when O<sub>2</sub> adsorbed on the surface oxygen vacancies, while O<sub>2</sub> adsorbed on the subsurface oxygen vacancies gave rise to ozone-like O<sub>3</sub><sup><i>\u03b4</i>-</sup> species by combining with the nearest surface lattice oxygen (O1). PDOS showed that hybridization of the 2p orbitals between O<sub>2</sub> and O1 formed a delocalized \u03c0 bond, confirming the formation of O<sub>3</sub><sup><i>\u03b4</i>-</sup>. For O<sub>2</sub><sup><i>\u03b4</i>-</sup>, electrons on Cu and O1 transferred to O<sub>2</sub> while the charge of Ce remained unchanged. However, for O<sub>3</sub><sup><i>\u03b4</i>-</sup>, the transferred electrons were mainly from O1, and partially from O2, Ce1 and Ce2. It was very interesting that Cu also received a few electrons in the latter case. Compared with CO directly adsorbed on lattice oxygen, the two oxygen species were active for CO oxidation, forming CO<sub>2</sub> or carbonates, and higher absolute adsorption energy was obtained with the interaction between CO and O<sub>3</sub><sup><i>\u03b4</i>-</sup>. The findings of this study provide new insight on the CO oxidation reaction mechanism, facilitating an in-depth understanding of Cu-doped CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jiao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Caishun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Honghao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Daosheng", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Normal University, Taiyuan 030000, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Xiaoning", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1895-4761"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petrochemical Engineering, Liaoning Petrochemical University, Fushun 113001, Liaoning, China. lnpuzhanglei@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Zhixian", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37999632", "10.1039/d3cp03885h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
