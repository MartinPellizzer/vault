However, sparse investigation of the dominating parameters controlling the HO<sub>2</sub> uptake coefficients onto ambient aerosols (\u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>) has largely hindered the application of the measured \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub> to the global spatial prediction. Here we induced an offline method using LFP-LIF technique to measure the kinetics of HO<sub>2</sub> uptake onto ambient aerosols collected in summertime and wintertime in Yokohama city, a regional urban site near Tokyo, Japan. By controlling the dominating parameters which influence \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>, we were able to investigate the detailed HO<sub>2</sub> uptake mechanism. We characterized the chemical composition of the collected ambient aerosols, including organics, inorganics, transition metals ions, etc. and modeled \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub> using different mechanisms. Results show that \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub> increased with the increase in RH, and the aerosol states (\"dry\" or wet/aqueous) have large effects on \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>. With fixed RH and aerosol chemical composition, \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>was highly dependent on pH and inversely correlated with [HO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub>. By combing the measured \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub> values with the modeled ones, we found that both the HO<sub>2</sub> self-reaction and transition metal-catalyzed reactions should be accounted for to yield a single parameterization to predict \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>, and different chemical compositions may have collective effects on \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub>. Results may serve for extending the \u03b3HO<sub>2</sub> values measured at one observation site to different environmental conditions, which will help us to achieve more accurate modeling results concerning secondary pollutant formation (i.e., ozone)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
