Rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD) were exposed to 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 ppm ozone or filtered air under different exposure regimens before or after infection for 1 or 2 h. The results revealed that at a proper concentration of ozone, e.g., 1.5 or 2 ppm, ozone exposure restricted virus production, prolonged survival time of cells and modulated cytokine production related to EV71 infection. Upon exposure of non-infected cells to ozone at 1.5 or 2 ppm for 1h, the production of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha was primed and boosted by the subsequent EV71 infection, generating an inhibitory effect on EV71 replication during the post-infection period of 48 h. While infected cells were exposed to ozone for 2 h at 1.5 or 2 ppm, ozone did not affect cytokine production by RD cells in response to EV71 infection. The data showed that ozone effect on induction of cytokine was only found in uninfected cells. The ozone-induced cytokines produced prior to the onset of EV71 infection generated antiviral effects, which proved beneficial in suppressing the subsequent EV71 infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Fooyin University, Ta-Liao Hsiang, Kaohsiung Hsien 831, Taiwan, ROC. dr005@mail.fy.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ya-Ching", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Juan", "ForeName": "Hao-Chan", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yi-Chen", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Antiviral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8109699", "ISSNLinking": "0166-3542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus A, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17764758", "10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.07.004", "S0166-3542(07)00374-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
