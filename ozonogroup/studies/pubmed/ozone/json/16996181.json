This paper presents new predictions of stomatal ozone flux to grasslands at five different locations in Europe, using a mechanistic model of canopy development for productive grasslands to generate time series of leaf area index and soil water potential as inputs to the stomatal component of the DO(3)SE ozone deposition model. The parameterisation of both models was based on Lolium perenne, a dominant species of productive pasture in Europe. The modelled seasonal time course of stomatal ozone flux to both the whole canopy and to upper leaves showed large differences between climatic zones, which depended on the timing of the start of the growing season, the effect of soil water potential, and the frequency of hay cuts. Values of modelled accumulated flux indices and the AOT40 index showed a five-fold difference between locations, but the locations with the highest flux differed depending on the index used; the period contributing to the accumulation of AOT40 did not always coincide with the modelled period of active ozone canopy uptake. Use of a fixed seasonal profile of leaf area index in the flux model produced very different estimates of annual accumulated total canopy and leaf ozone flux when compared with the flux model linked to a simulation of canopy growth. Regional scale model estimates of both the risks of ozone impacts and of total ozone deposition will be inaccurate unless the effects of climate and management in modifying grass canopy growth are incorporated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Department, University of York, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, UK. ma512@york.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashmore", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcker", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emberson", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terry", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toet", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lolium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16996181", "10.1016/j.envpol.2006.06.021", "S0269-7491(06)00402-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
