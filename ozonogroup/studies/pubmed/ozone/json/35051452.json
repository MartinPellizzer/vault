This review aims at providing comprehensive and state-of-the-art knowledge and insights of technologies for chloride removal. Mechanisms for chloride removal mainly include chemical precipitation, adsorption, oxidation and membrane separation. In chemical precipitation, chloride removal by forming CuCl, AgCl, BiOCl and Friedel's salt. Adsorbents used in chloride removal mainly include ion exchangers, bimetal oxides and carbon-based electrodes. Oxidation for chloride removal contains ozone-based, electrochemical and sulfate radical-based oxidation. Membrane separation for chloride removal consists of diffusion dialysis, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis. In this review, we specifically proposed the factors that affect chloride removal process and the corresponding strategies for improving removal efficiency. In the last section, the remaining challenges of method explorations and material developments were stated to provide guidelines for future development of chloride removal technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
