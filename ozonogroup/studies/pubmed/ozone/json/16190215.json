Atmospheric samples were collected off-shore over the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as well as at a background station in Northeastern Crete, Greece. PAH total concentration varied from 4.1 to 57.2 ng m(-3), with >90% in the gas phase. Gas-to-particle distribution of PAHs was correlated (R2 0.75-0.98, p < 0.001) with their subcooled vapor pressure. Seasonal changes in the total concentration of PAHs were not observed, while the origin of air mass was the dominant factor determining their atmospheric concentration levels. Air masses, originating from central and eastern Europe, were associated with the highest PAH concentrations. Gas-to-particle distribution of sigmaPAHs correlated well (R2 0.75-0.98, p < 0.001) with their subcooled vapor pressure. Tropospheric ozone concentration correlated with the vapor-phase PAH concentration (p < 0.001) but less (p < 0.01) with the particulate PAH concentration. Distribution of volatile PAHs over the Eastern Mediterranean basin was uniform. Conversely, particulate PAH concentrations were higher at sampling sites located close to urban centers. Calculated relative removal rates of PAHs associated with particles were significantly higher than those of volatile members."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Chemical Processes Laboratory (ECPL), Department of Chemistry, University of Crete, EL- 71409 Heraklion, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsapakis", "ForeName": "Manolis", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stephanou", "ForeName": "Euripides G", "Initials": "EG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Sea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16190215", "10.1021/es050532l"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
