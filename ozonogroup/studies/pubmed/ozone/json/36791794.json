Patient and meteorological data were linked based on residential area. An interrupted time series analysis with Poisson segmented regression was used to compare the rates before and after AQWS introduction. Adjustment variables included seasonality, air pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 \u03bcm in diameter, and ozone), temperature, and humidity.", "After AQWS implementation, the incidence of asthma gradually decreased by 20.5%. Cardiovascular disease and stroke incidence also significantly decreased (by 34.3 and 43.0%, respectively). However, no immediate or gradual decrease was identified in the exacerbation rate of any environmental disease after AQWS implementation. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to age, disability, and health insurance coverage type. Overall, the AQWS effectively mitigated the occurrence of most environmental diseases in Korea. However, the relationships between alarm system implementation and reduced incidence differed among diseases based on the characteristics of vulnerable and sensitive individuals.", "Our results suggest that by tailoring the AQWS to demographic and sociological characteristics and providing enhanced education about the warning system, interventions can become an efficient policy tool to decrease air pollution- related health risks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Health Big Data Clinical Research Institute, Yonsei University Wonju Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "YouHyun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Health Big Data Clinical Research Institute, Yonsei University Wonju Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Koo", "ForeName": "Jun Hyuk", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Health Big Data Clinical Research Institute, Yonsei University Wonju Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Hoyeon", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Ji Ye", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Changsoo", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Health Big Data Clinical Research Institute, Yonsei University Wonju Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation, Wonju, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Precision Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Dae Ryong", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Epidemiol Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101519472", "ISSNLinking": "2092-7193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interrupted Time Series Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}], "CoiStatement": "\n<b>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</b>\n.
