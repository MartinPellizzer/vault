When Bz<sub>2</sub>Cr and O<sub>3</sub> were co-deposited, they reacted upon matrix deposition to produce two new prominent peaks in the infrared spectrum at 431 cm-1 and 792 cm-1. These peaks increased upon annealing the matrix to 35 K and decreased upon UV irradiation at <i>\u03bb</i> = 254 nm. The oxygen-18 and mixed oxygen-16,18 isotopic shift pattern of the peak at 792 cm-1 is consistent with the antisymmetric stretch of a symmetric ozonide species. DFT calculations of many possible ozonide products of this reaction were made. The formation of a hydrogen ozonide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) best fits the original peaks and the oxygen-18 isotope shift pattern. Energy considerations lead to the conclusion that the chromium-containing product of this reaction is the coupled product benzene-chromium-biphenyl-chromium-benzene (BzCrBPCrBz). 2Bz2Cr+O3\u2192H2O3+BzCrBPCrBz, \u2206Ecalc=-52.13kcal/mol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0009-0006-8558-1896"], "LastName": "Kugel", "ForeName": "Roger W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ault", "ForeName": "Bruce S", "Initials": "BS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124988", "10.3390/molecules29153583", "molecules29153583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
