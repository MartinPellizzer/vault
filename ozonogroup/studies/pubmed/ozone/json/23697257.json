The study was carried out at the Department of Endodontics and Restorative dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb. A total of 37 tooth root canals from 23 teeth (10 incisors, 2 canines, 8 premolars and 3 molars) with a diagnosis of chronic apical periodontitis (17 untreated teeth and 6 retreatments) from 20 adult patients (11 females and 9 male) were selected. Endodontic samples consisted of 74 swabs from 37 canals. The first root canal swab was taken following a completed chemomechanical instrumentation by a sterile paper point after rinsing the root canal with a sterile saline solution. The canal was dried and treated with ozone gas for 40 seconds (HealOzone, Kavo, Germany). After the ozone treatment the canal was rinsed with a sterile saline solution a second swab was taken. The swabs were stored in transport media until cultivation. Microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, commercial biochemical test microbiological analysis and bacteria count. A significant decrease in the number of bacteria (p < 0.001) was found after the ozone treatment: the total number of bacteria was 82%, 67% of aerobic and 93% of anaerobic bacteria. When analysing individually, a significant decrease was found for Streptococcus mitis and Propionibacterium acnes (p < 0.05). The results of this study shows the efficacy of ozone on the bacterial count reduction in the root canal treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine, Department of Endodontics and Restorative Dentistry, Zagreb, Croatia."}], "LastName": "Halbauer", "ForeName": "Kristina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prskalo", "ForeName": "Katica", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jankovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Bernard", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tarle", "ForeName": "Zrinka", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Panduri\u0107", "ForeName": "Vlatko", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaleni\u0107", "ForeName": "Smilja", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Coll Antropol", "NlmUniqueID": "8003354", "ISSNLinking": "0350-6134"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Aerobic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria, Anaerobic"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dentistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Root"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23697257"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
