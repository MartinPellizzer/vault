However, few studies have emphasized the occurrence and adverse effects of VOCs from coking wastewater treatment processes. In this research, pollution profiles of both air and water phase VOCs in a typical coking wastewater treatment plant were investigated in terms of distribution characteristics, air-water exchange, ozone formation potential (OFP) and associated human health risks. Thirty VOCs were detected in the air phase, in which benzene and naphthalene were found to be the major VOCs with total contribution of 87.81 %. Nineteen VOCs were detected in the water phase, in which benzene, naphthalene and toluene contribute most to total VOCs with total contribution of 75.1 %. The regulating tank (RT) was the major source of VOCs, and the emission rate of total VOCs from all unites was 2711.03 g/d with annual emission of 0.99 t. The emission factor was estimated to be 1.36 g VOCs/m<sup>3</sup> wastewater. The air-water exchange was assessed using the Fugacity model, and water-to-air volatilization was predominant based on the net flux of air-water exchange. OFP evaluated by emission factor indicated that the total OFP in RT was the highest (1.52 g O<sub>3</sub>/m<sup>3</sup> wastewater), and toluene contributed 41.8 % of the total OFP, followed by naphthalene accounting for 38.7 % The total carcinogenic risks were in the range of 8.60 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup> to 2.18 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup>, in which the RT exceeded the significant risk threshold (>1 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>). The non-carcinogenic risks of hazard quotient value in RT also exceeded the risk threshold (>1), and naphthalene was the major contributor accounting for 79.02 %. These results not only provided comprehensive knowledge on pollution profiles and environmental risks of VOCs during coking wastewater treatment processes, but also facilitated the implement of VOCs regulation and occupational health protection strategies in coking industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
