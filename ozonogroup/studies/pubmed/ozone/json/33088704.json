Desensitizing agents containing arginine and calcium carbonate have emerged effective in occluding tubules. Ozone removes the smear layer and opens up the dentinal tubules for easy penetration of these desensitizing agents.", "To comparatively evaluate the effect of ozonated oil on the patency and occlusion of dentinal tubules with and without adjunctive application of a desensitizing agent containing arginine.", "80 dentin specimens that were distributed into 4 groups as Group 1 (control), Group 2 (ozonated oil), Group 3 (desensitizing agent) and Group 4 (desensitizing agent following the application of ozonated oil), underwent an acid challenge. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the dentin specimens were obtained prior to any treatment, after the application of the therapeutic agents and after acid challenge and mean tubule occlusion scores were recorded in each case employing a suitable scoring system. The statistical analysis employed One-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey's Post hoc test and Student Paired <i>t</i>-test for intergroup and intragroup comparisons of the mean tubule occlusion scores respectively.", "Group 2, treated with ozonated oil alone showed a statistically significant increase in the number of open dentinal tubules. Group 4 showed more compact deposits of desensitizing agent and more densely occluded tubules as compared to Group 3 which was more retained in the former even after acid challenge.", "Adjunctive application of the desensitizing agent containing arginine, with ozonated oil has a synergistic effect, where the latter causes opening of dentinal tubules allowing more compact penetration of the former and thus may be a potentially more effective treatment approach in the management of DH."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Craniofacial Research Foundation.
