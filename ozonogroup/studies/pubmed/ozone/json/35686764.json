The results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> concentration near the surface of Henan province increased first and then decreased from 2015 to 2020. The highest O<sub>3</sub> concentration was found in 2018, and the annual mean of the maximum daily 8 h moving mean (MDA8) of O<sub>3</sub> was 110.70 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The difference in MDA8 values among different stations gradually decreased. From 2015 to 2020, the average monthly MDA8 in Henan province showed an upward trend, with a growth rate of 2.46 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>. According to the MK trend test, except for in Luohe, Nanyang, and Pingdingshan, the rising trend in other cities was significant (<i>P</i><0.05). The concentration of MDA8 in the four seasons also showed an increasing trend during the 6 years as follows:autumn (19.31%)>winter (17.09%)>spring (16.82%)>summer (7.24%). From 2015 to 2019, the high value of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> was concentrated in the northwest of Henan province, and the concentration showed a decreasing trend with a decreasing rate of 0.34\u00d710<sup>15</sup> molecules\u00b7(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, whereas the tropospheric HCHO showed a slow rising trend with an annual growth rate of 0.19\u00d710<sup>15</sup> molecules\u00b7(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, with a higher concentration in the northern urban area. The O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity control area from 2015 to 2019 showed that most of the eastern part of Henan province belonged to the VOCs limited category."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yang-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221008, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221008, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35686764", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202108287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
