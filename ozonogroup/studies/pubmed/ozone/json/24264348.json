There arose a necessity to establish a specialized observational system for conducting observations of changes in the state of the environment, and of ecological consequences of pollution as well as to produce assessments of the current and predicted states. The realized program of background monitoring and first results of integrated background measurements have already been published. The paper presented illustrates time-and-space features of the background pollution of natural environmental media according to data from various background stations. (2) Long-term systematic measurements at the 'Borovoe' station (Kazakh SSR) commenced in 1976 have been supplemented with the results of the background pollution studies carried out in Berezinskyi, Caucasian, Central-Chernozem, Sary-Chelek, and Repetek Biosphere Reserves and in locations of the background stations in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The data from the Hungarian and Czechoslovak stations were obtained during joint expeditions. Details are given in the relevant publications. (3) Ozone. Ozone measurements show the diurnal variation with the day-time maxima from 35 up to 160 \u03bcg m(-3). The correlation between day-time and nocturnal concentrations is a good indicator of the anthropogenic effect. (4) Sulphur dioxide and sulphates. The annual variation of sulphur dioxide characterised by winter maximum and summer minimum indicates the direct dependence on the amount of fuel burnt in the given region. Mean values of the sulphur dioxide content in the surface layer of the atmosphere correlates with the extent of the region urbanization and varies within 0.2-12.5 \u03bcg m(-3). The value of sulphur dioxide and sulphates correlation in the atmosphere is rather stable and varies within 0.18-0.37 \u03bcg m(-3). (5) Heavy metals. The annual cycle of the atmospheric content of lead, cadmium and arsenic is well expressed by winter maximum and summer minimum (which is opposite in case of mercury). As for lead and mercury, their annual variation is more distinct than that of cadmium and arsenic; their time-and-space variation is also more distinct. The content of these metals in the urbanized regions of Europe is 5 times higher than in Asia and the Caucasus. Atmospheric contents of arsenic and cadmium vary insignificantly from region to region. The content of all these metals in other environmental media (soil, water, vegetation) is of insignificant spatial variability. Observations in the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve showed minimum levels of the background atmospheric pollution: lead-16 \u03bcg m(-3), mercury-5 ng m(-3), arsenic-3.9 ng m(-3), cadmium-0.5 ng m(-3). (6) Organochloride pesticides. Concentrations of DDT and its metabolites and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers in the environmental media of European background regions are 3 times higher than those in Asia ('Borovoe'). (7) PAH. Atmospheric content of BaP has a well expressed annual variation with winter maximum; the difference between winter and summer periods reaches the magnitude of an order. Background concentrations in European regions (Hungary, Berzinskyi Biosphere Reserve) are noticeably higher than in Asia; the difference reaches 3-5 times. (8) Comparisons with literature data on the background pollution show that observational materials from the background monitoring stations supplement to a considerable extent, and extent, the current notions on the background pollution and show the effects of the man-made impact on the background regions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Environment and Climate Monitoring Laboratory, U.S.S.R.
