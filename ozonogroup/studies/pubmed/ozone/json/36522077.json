Herein, we evaluated the effects of changes in aerosols, precursor emissions, and meteorology on O<sub>3</sub> in summer (June) of 2015-2019 over NCP via 8 scenarios with WRF-Chem model. The simulated mean MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in urban areas of 13 major cities in NCP increased by 17.1%\u223c34.8%, which matched well with the observations (10.8%\u223c33.1%). Meanwhile, the model could faithfully reproduce the changes in aerosol loads, precursors, and meteorological conditions. A relatively-even O<sub>3</sub> increase (+1.2%\u223c+3.9% for 24-h O<sub>3</sub> and +1.0%\u223c+3.8% for MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) was induced by PM<sub>2.5</sub> dropping, which was consistent with the geographic distribution of regional PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction. Meanwhile, the NO<sub>2</sub> reduction coupled with a near-constant VOCs led to the elevated VOCs/NO<sub>x</sub> ratios, and then caused O<sub>3</sub> rising in the areas under VOCs-limited regimes. Therein, the pronounced increases occurred in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Langfang (+10.7%\u223c+13.6% for 24-h O<sub>3</sub> and +10.2%\u223c+12.2% for MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>); while the increases in other cities were 5.7%\u223c10.5% for 24-h O<sub>3</sub> and 4.9%\u223c9.2% for MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>. Besides, the meteorological fluctuations brought about the more noticeable O<sub>3</sub> increases in northern parts (+12.5%\u223c+13.5% for 24-h O<sub>3</sub> and +11.2%\u223c+12.4% for MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) than those in southern and central parts (+3.2%\u223c+9.3% for 24-h O<sub>3</sub> and +3.7%\u223c+8.8% for MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>). The sum of the impacts of the three drivers reached 16.7%\u223c21.9%, which were comparable to the changes of the observed O<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, exploring reasonable emissions-reduction strategies is essential for the ozone pollution mitigation over this region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
