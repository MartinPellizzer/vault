This environmental transition ultimately paved the way for the rise of multicellular life and provides a blueprint for how a biosphere can transform a planetary surface. However, estimates of atmospheric oxygen levels for large intervals of Earth's history still vary by orders of magnitude-foremost for Earth's middle history. Historically, estimates of mid-Proterozoic (1.9-0.8 Ga) atmospheric oxygen levels are inferred based on the kinetics of reactions occurring in soils or in the oceans, rather than being directly tracked by atmospheric signatures. Rare oxygen isotope systematics-based on quantifying the rare oxygen isotope <sup>17</sup>O in addition to the conventionally determined <sup>16</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O-provide a means to track atmospheric isotopic signatures and thus potentially provide more direct estimates of atmospheric oxygen levels through time. Oxygen isotope signatures that deviate strongly from the expected mass-dependent relationship between <sup>16</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, and <sup>18</sup>O develop during ozone formation, and these \"mass-independent\" signals can be transferred to the rock record during oxidation reactions in surface environments that involve atmospheric O<sub>2</sub>. The magnitude of these signals is dependent upon <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>, and the overall extent of biospheric productivity. Here, we use a stochastic approach to invert the mid-Proterozoic \u0394<sup>17</sup>O record for a new estimate of atmospheric <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub>, leveraging explicit coupling of <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> and biospheric productivity in a biogeochemical Earth system model to refine the range of atmospheric <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> values that is consistent with a given observed \u0394<sup>17</sup>O. Using this approach, we find new evidence that atmospheric oxygen levels were less than \u223c1% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) for at least some intervals of the Proterozoic Eon."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Planavsky", "ForeName": "Noah J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}], "LastName": "Reinhard", "ForeName": "Christopher T", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Institute, University of Waikato, Tauranga, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Isson", "ForeName": "Terry T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Toho University, Funabashi, Chiba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Kazumi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geosciences, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA."}], "LastName": "Crockford", "ForeName": "Peter W", "Initials": "PW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Astrobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "101088083", "ISSNLinking": "1557-8070"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WAT0DDB505", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Sulfate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Geologic Sediments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32228301", "10.1089/ast.2019.2060"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
