Indications of its therapeutic application are increasing, and evidence for its usefulness is growing. Evidence of its antibacterial and proliferative activity suggests its efficacy in treating chronic wounds. The current study evaluated the effect of ozone therapy on the health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds.In the present cross-sectional study, the health-related quality of life was evaluated in 86 patients with chronic wounds undergoing ozone therapy. To measure quality of life, 2 previously established questionnaires were used, the Cardiff wound impact questionnaire and the SF-36 questionnaire. Questionnaires were completed through interviews with the patients.A total of 86 patients with chronic wounds undergoing ozone therapy participated in this study. The mean age of participants was 58.91 years; 69.8% of them were male, 91.9% had diabetes mellitus, and 50% were receiving insulin therapy. Patients were under local (26.7%), systemic (9.3%), and local plus systemic (64%) protocols of ozone therapy. Mean overall quality of life reported by the patients was 6.2, and mean overall quality of life satisfaction was 6.02 (measured by the Cardiff Wound Impact Questionnaire). Mean physical quality of life measured by the SF-36 questionnaire was 39.12, and mean mental quality of life was 44.37 (measured by the same questionnaire). Among the included variables, the number of ozone therapy sessions was the strongest predictor of quality of life in both questionnaires and remained significant after different levels of adjustment.In addition to the significant improvement observed in the healing of chronic wounds, medical O3 therapy has also shown to effect a significant improvement in the health-related quality of life of patients and could be a valuable therapeutic option in chronic wound cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ozonecrc, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izadi", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, University of Mazandaran, Babolsar, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bozorgi", "ForeName": "Majedeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hosseine", "ForeName": "Mahboobeh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khalili", "ForeName": "Nahid", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jonaidi-Jafari", "ForeName": "Nematollah", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Medicine (Baltimore)", "NlmUniqueID": "2985248R", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7974"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comorbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Richmond NA, Maderal AD, Vivas AC.
