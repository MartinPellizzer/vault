In stratified analysis, we observed significant associations only between recurrent (n=280) and large artery ischaemic stroke (n=578) onset and short-term effect of O3 exposure. For an increase of 10 \u00b5g/m(3) of O3 level, recurrent stroke risk (mean D-1, D-2 and D-3 lag) was increased by 12.1% (95% CI 1.5% to 23.9%) and large artery stroke risk (mean D-3 and D-4 lag) was increased by 8% (95% CI 2.0% to 16.6%).
