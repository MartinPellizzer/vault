The organ primarily affected by UVR is the skin, which is composed of a variety of different cell types. Here, UVR is needed for production of active vitamin D as well as producing undesirable effects such as sunburn, premature cutaneous photoaging, and promoting skin cancer development. Depending on the radiation dose, UVR influences virtually every cutaneous cell type investigated differently. Since the end of the nineteenth century, sun exposure has been known to induce skin cancer, which is now the human malignancy with the most rapidly increasing incidence. In several experimental models, mid-range UVR has been demonstrated to be the major cause of UV-induced cutaneous tumors. The stratospheric ozone layer protecting the terrestrial surface from higher quantum energy solar radiation is being damaged by industrial activities resulting in the possibility of increased UVR exposure in the future. Investigations in the field of experimental dermatology have shown that within the skin an immunosurveillance system exists that may be able to detect incipient neoplasms and to elicit a host responses against it. This article reviews the literature on studies designed to investigate the effects of UVR on cutaneous cellular components, with special focus on the immune system within the skin and the development of UV-induced cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beissert", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Granstein", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AR 40667", "Acronym": "AR", "Agency": "NIAMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8903774", "ISSNLinking": "1040-9238"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immune System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Langerhans Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photobiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunburn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "150"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8994803", "10.3109/10409239609108723"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
