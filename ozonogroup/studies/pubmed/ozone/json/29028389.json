One of the most promising approaches for the investigation of the chemical structure of such substances is the combination of the high-resolution mass spectrometry and selective chemical reactions. Here, we report the investigation of the ozonation products of natural complex mixtures using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Ozonation of crude oil results in the appearance of the new compounds with high content (up to 9 atom) of oxygen. Isotopic exchange reaction showed that those oxygen stem from the carbonyl groups. Ozonation of the dissolved organic matter leads to the destruction of the substance and shift towards the region of the saturated compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Institute for Energy Problems of Chemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 The Joint Institute for High Temperatures of Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Kostyukevich", "ForeName": "Yury", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Gubkin Russia State University of Oil and Gas, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Stavitskaya", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Institute for Energy Problems of Chemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "7 Department of Chemistry, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Zherebker", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Konstantinova", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 The Joint Institute for High Temperatures of Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Vlaskin", "ForeName": "Mikhail", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "8 National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Borisova", "ForeName": "Ludmila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Institute for Energy Problems of Chemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Kononikhin", "ForeName": "Alexey", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Popov", "ForeName": "Igor", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Institute for Energy Problems of Chemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Emanuel Institute for Biochemical Physics Russia Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Nikolaev", "ForeName": "Eugene", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Mass Spectrom (Chichester)", "NlmUniqueID": "101124748", "ISSNLinking": "1469-0667"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29028389", "10.1177/1469066717718836"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
