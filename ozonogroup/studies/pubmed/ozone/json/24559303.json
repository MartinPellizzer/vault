Here we report direct experimental rate measurements of the simplest Criegee Intermediate reacting with C2\u2013C4 alkenes obtained using the laser flash photolysis technique probing the recently measured B(1)A\u2032 \u2190 X(1)A\u2032 transition in CH2OO. The measured activation energy (298\u2013494 K) for CH2OO + alkenes is Ea \u2248 3500 \u00b1 1000 J mol(\u20131) for all alkyl substituted alkenes and Ea = 7000 \u00b1 900 J mol(\u20131) for ethene. The measured Arrhenius pre-exponential factors (A) vary between (2 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10(\u201315) and (11 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10(\u201315) cm(3) molecule(\u20131) s(\u20131). Quantum chemical calculations of the corresponding rate coefficients reproduce qualitative reactivity trends but overestimate the absolute rate coefficients. Despite the small Ea's, the CH2OO + alkene rate coefficients are almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of similar reactions between CH2OO and carbonyl compounds. Using the rate constants measured here, we estimate that, under typical atmospheric conditions, reaction with alkenes does not represent a significant sink of CH2OO. In environments rich in C\u2550C double bonds, however, such as ozone-exposed rubber or emission plumes, these reactions can play a significant role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, United States."}], "LastName": "Buras", "ForeName": "Zachary J", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elsamra", "ForeName": "Rehab M I", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jalan", "ForeName": "Amrit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Middaugh", "ForeName": "Joshua E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "William H", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24559303", "10.1021/jp4118985"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
