In both counties I had monitoring information on PM(10), CO, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3). In Los Angeles, monitoring information on PM(2.5) was available as well. In addition to full-year analyses, I performed season-specific analyses. I present the results of both single- and multipollutant analyses. Although components of air pollution were associated with total nonaccidental and vascular disease mortality in both counties, the results indicate considerable heterogeneity of these associations in the two locations and also from season to season. In Los Angeles County, the gases, particularly CO and SO(2) but not ozone, were more strongly associated with mortality than was particulate matter, which exhibited only weak and inconsistent associations with both mortality endpoints. Both PM(10) and the gases were associated with total and vascular disease mortality in Cook County. The association of the gases with both mortality endpoints appeared to be stronger and more robust than that of PM(10). Exposure-response analyses using flexible smoothers showed significant departures from linearity, particularly for PM effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N-MP 665, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. smoolgav@fhcrc.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moolgavkar", "ForeName": "Suresh H", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Inhal Toxicol. 2004 Feb;16(2):113; author reply 114.", "PMID": "15204784"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chicago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12872178", "10.1080/08958370390215767", "BNVFBEBE903NHRPQ"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
