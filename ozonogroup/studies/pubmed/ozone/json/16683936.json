The impact of filtration and the influence of the ozone generation method were also examined. The evaluations were made in four identical 40 m3 low-polluting test offices ventilated at 1.4 h(-1) or in two identical 30 m3 stainless-steel chambers ventilated at 1.9 h(-1). Concentrations of ozone, total volatile organic compounds and size-fractionated particles were continuously monitored in each experiment. The results indicate that, for each of the six conditions, the PAQ was poorer when ozone and limonene were present together compared with when only ozone or only limonene was present. In the test offices a correlation was observed between the number of secondary organic aerosols produced by a given ozone/limonene condition and the sensory pollution load for that condition. The particles themselves do not appear to be the primary causative agents, but instead are co-varying surrogates for sensory offending gas-phase species.", "Although the health consequences of long-term exposures to the products of ozone-initiated indoor chemistry remain to be determined, we judge that the sensory offending nature of selected products provides an additional reason to limit indoor ozone levels. Devices that emit ozone at significant rates should not be used indoors. Ozone-filtration of make-up air should also be beneficial in mechanically ventilated buildings located in regions that repeatedly violate outdoor ozone standards. Additionally, the use of limonene containing products should be curtailed during periods when indoor ozone levels are elevated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Technical University of Denmark, 2800-Kgs.
