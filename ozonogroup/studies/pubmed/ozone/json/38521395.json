Tyre-wear particles (TWPs) are the second largest source of microplastics in the ocean following abrasion of synthetic fibres. In addition to the particles themselves, TWPs contain many harmful chemicals, including 6PPD. This chemical reacts with atmospheric ozone and forms the toxic compound 6PPD-quinone (6PPDq), which poses a danger to aquatic life. There is a knowledge gap in understanding risks associated with the combined toxicity of nanoplastics (NPs) and 6PPDq. The present study aimed to investigate the toxicity of NPs and 6PPDq on adult zebrafish using phenotypic (behaviour, histology) and transcriptomic endpoints. Zebrafish were exposed to four treatments: control (contaminant-free), 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L 6PPDq, 3\u00a0mg/L polystyrene (PS)-NPs, and a combination of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L 6PPDq and 3\u00a0mg/L PS-NPs. We did not observe locomotory dysregulation in zebrafish exposed to NPs. However, we found significant hyperlocomotion in zebrafish exposed to 6PPDq and this effect was even more substantial after co-exposure with PS-NPs. This study explores the molecular mechanisms behind these effects, identifying genes associated with neurotransmitters and fatty acid metabolism that were dysregulated by the co-exposure. Transcriptomic analysis further showed that both 6PPDq and PS-NPs impacted cellular processes associated with sterol biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism, and muscle tissue development. The effects on these mechanisms were stronger in co-exposed zebrafish, indicating a heightened risk to cellular integrity and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results highlight the significance of mixture toxicity when studying the effects of NPs and associated chemicals like 6PPDq."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
