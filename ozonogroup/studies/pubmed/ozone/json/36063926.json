In this study, a novel cascade pretreatment with ozonation and ammonia stripping (O + S) was employed to remove these inhibitors, and was compared with single pretreatment approach. The optimum parameters for ozonation and ammonia stripping were obtained and the mechanisms of inhibition elimination were investigated. The results show that ozonation contributed to the degradation of non-fluorescent chromophoric organics through the direct molecular ozone attack, which mitigated the inhibition of chromaticity to microalgae, while ammonia stripping relieved the inhibition of high TAN to microalgae. After cascade pretreatment, TAN, total nitrogen (TN), COD and chromaticity were reduced by 80.2 %, 75.4 %, 20.6 % and 75.8 % respectively. When C. vulgaris was cultured on different pretreated digestate, it was found that cascade pretreatment was beneficial for retaining high PSII activity and synergistically improved microalgal growth. The highest biomass increment and productivity achieved 5.40 g L<sup>-1</sup> and 900 mg L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> respectively in the integration system of cascade pretreatment with microalgae cultivation (O + S + M). After O + S + M treatment, the removal efficiencies of TAN, TN, COD and total phosphorus (TP) were 100 %, 92.8 %, 46.7 % and 99.6 %, respectively. This work provided a promising strategy (O + S + M) for sustainable liquid digestate treatment, along with nutrient recovery and value-added biomass production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
