The goal of this study was to report a high risk case, treated by ozone therapy, and collagen powder. Ozone therapy and collagen powder can improve healing process of diabetic foot ulcers.", "This case report presents a successful nonsurgical outpatient approach for managing a high-risk diabetic foot ulcer with tendon exposure in an older adult with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and severe heart failure. Due to the patient's comorbidities, surgical intervention was not an option, leading to the utilization of ozone therapy, collagen powder, and Phenytoin ointment. The significance of this case lies in the treatment of a high-risk foot ulcer through a nonsurgical approach, considering the patient's uncontrolled diabetes and severe heart failure. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are debilitating and life-threatening complications, often resulting in amputations, socio-psychological burdens, and lifestyle changes. Conventional treatment methods have shown limited success, necessitating the exploration of new and innovative approaches. The use of ozone therapy has emerged as a potential treatment, but its safety and efficacy in DFUs require further investigation. The positive outcomes observed in this case report suggest that ozone therapy may be a viable option for treating DFUs, and further studies are recommended to evaluate its effectiveness."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors.
