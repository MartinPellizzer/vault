Volatile anaesthetics in medical waste gases could be removed via adsorption using suitable activated carbon materials possessing an enhanced affinity to anaesthetic molecules. In this work, the effects of surface physical and chemical properties on sevoflurane adsorption were investigated by oxidative hydrothermal surface modification of a commercial activated carbon using only distilled water. The hydrothermal surface modification was carried out at different treatment temperatures (150-300\u00a0\u00b0C) for varying durations (10-30\u00a0min), and adsorption was conducted under fixed conditions (bed depth\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0cm, inlet concentration\u00a0=\u00a0528\u00a0mg/L, and flow rate\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0L/min). The hydrothermal treatment generally increased the BET surface area of the activated carbons. At oxidation temperatures above 200\u00a0\u00b0C, the micropore volume of the samples diminished. The relative amount of surface oxygen was enriched as the treatment temperature increased. Treatment duration did not significantly affect the introduction of relative amount of surface oxygen, except at higher temperatures. There were no new types of functional groups introduced. However, disappearance and re-formation of oxygen functional groups containing C-O structures (as in hydroxyl and ether groups) occurred when treatment temperature was increased from 150 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, and when treatments were conducted above 200\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The ester/acetal groups were enriched under the temperature range studied. The findings suggested that the re-formation of surface oxygen functionalities might lead to the development of functional groups that improve sevoflurane adsorption."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
