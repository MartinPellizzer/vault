The emission factors (EFs) of VOCs from coking plants are not well known, and thus, this study characterized the VOCs in the emissions from four coking plants in Shanxi, China. The EFs of VOCs from different stages of the coking process were calculated, and coal charging exhibited the highest EFs of VOCs, followed by the flue gases from combustion of coke oven gas, wastewater treatment, coke pushing and chemical byproduct recycling. The VOCs in emissions differed by coking process. Alkanes, aromatics and alkenes were the main VOCs emitted during the coking, wastewater treatment and chemical byproduct recycling processes, respectively. To effectively control the contribution of VOCs from coking processes to secondary organic aerosols and ozone formation, attention should be given to wastewater treatment and coal loading processes. The mean annual weight of VOCs emitted from coking plants in China from 2019 to 2021 was estimated to be 32.91\u00a0Gg with coking, chemical byproduct recycling, and wastewater treatment processes accounting for 91.34%, 7.85%, and 0.80% of total VOCs, respectively. An uneven spatial distribution of VOCs emissions in China was identified, with Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia and Shandong being the largest contributors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
