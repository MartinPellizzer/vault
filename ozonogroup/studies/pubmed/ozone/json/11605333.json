The purpose was to quantify qualitative associations that have been detected between such admissions and a number of environmental variables. The following data were used: unscheduled daily emergency hospital admissions, Madrid air pollution data, and meteorological data. Time-series analysis was performed, with Box-Jenkins modeling. A multivariate model was constructed, incorporating the different causes of admissions and the respective environmental variables. Statistically significant associations were found between hospital admissions and other variables, indicating relationships with temperature, relative humidity, and mean daily tropospheric ozone concentrations. Whereas the effect of heat on admissions was short term, that of cold was in evidence from the second week. The association with ozone showed a seven-day lag and basically manifested itself as an influence on admissions for circulatory disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro Universitario de Salud P\u00fablica, C/ General Or\u00e1a 39, E-28006 Madrid, Spain. julio.diaz@uam.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alberdi", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pajares", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lage", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Otero", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0405525", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0892"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Admission"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11605333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
