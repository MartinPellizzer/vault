Here we assess the effect of elevated seasonal O\u2083 exposure on the total and redox proteomes of soybean. \u2022 To understand the molecular responses to O\u2083 exposure, soybean grown at the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment facility under ambient (37 ppb), moderate (58 ppb), and high (116 ppb) O\u2083 concentrations was examined by redox-sensitive thiol labeling, mass spectrometry, and targeted enzyme assays. \u2022 Proteomic analysis of soybean leaf tissue exposed to high O\u2083 concentrations reveals widespread changes. In the high-O\u2083 treatment leaf, 35 proteins increased up to fivefold in abundance, 22 proteins showed up to fivefold higher oxidation, and 22 proteins increased in both abundance and oxidation. These changes occurred in carbon metabolism, photosynthesis, amino acid synthesis, flavonoid and isoprenoid biosynthesis, signaling and homeostasis, and antioxidant pathways. \u2022 This study shows that seasonal O\u2083 exposure in soybean alters the abundance and oxidation state of redox-sensitive multiple proteins and that these changes reflect a combination of damage effects and adaptive responses that influence a wide range of metabolic processes, which in some cases may help mitigate oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 The Authors.
