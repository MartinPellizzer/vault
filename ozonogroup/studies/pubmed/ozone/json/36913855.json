However, knowledge concerning the hotspots and hot moments of soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions with manure application and irrigation, as well as the underlying mechanisms remain incomplete. Here, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with the combination of fertilization (no fertilizer, F0; 100% chemical fertilizer N, Fc; 50% chemical N\u00a0+\u00a050% manure N, Fc\u00a0+\u00a0m; and 100% manure N, Fm) and irrigation (with irrigation, W1; and without irrigation, W0; at wheat jointing stage) for winter wheat - summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain. Results showed that irrigation did not affect annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions of the wheat-maize system. Manure application (Fc\u00a0+\u00a0m and Fm) reduced annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by 25-51% compared with Fc, which mainly occurred during 2 weeks after fertilization combined with irrigation (or heavy rainfall). In particular, Fc\u00a0+\u00a0m reduced the cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions during 2 weeks after winter wheat sowing and summer maize top dressing by 0.28 and 0.11\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, compared with Fc. Meanwhile, Fm maintained the grain N yield and Fc\u00a0+\u00a0m increased grain N yield by 8% compared with Fc under W1. Overall, Fm maintained the annual grain N yield and lower N<sub>2</sub>O emissions compared to Fc under W0, and Fc\u00a0+\u00a0m increased the annual grain N yield and maintained N<sub>2</sub>O emissions compared with Fc under W1, respectively. Our results provide scientific support for using manure to minimize N<sub>2</sub>O emissions while maintaining crop N yield under optimal irrigation to support the green transition in agricultural production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
