But in plasma-alone process, various undesired by-products are produced, which causes secondary pollutions. Here, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor has been developed for the oxidation of naphthalene over a TiO<sub>2</sub>/diatomite catalyst at low temperature. In comparison to plasma-alone process, the combination of plasma and TiO<sub>2</sub>/diatomite catalyst significantly enhanced naphthalene conversion (up to 40%) and CO<sub>x</sub> selectivity (up to 92%), and substantially reduced the formation of aerosol (up to 90%) and secondary volatile organic compounds (up to near 100%). The mechanistic study suggested that the presence of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/diatomite catalyst intensified the electron energy in the DBD. Meantime, the energized electrons generated in the discharge activated TiO<sub>2</sub>, while the presence of ozone enhanced the activity of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/diatomite catalyst. This plasma-catalyst interaction led to the synergetic effect resulting from the combination of plasma and TiO<sub>2</sub>/diatomite catalyst, consequently enhanced the oxidation of naphthalene. Importantly, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of plasma to activate the photocatalyst for the deep oxidation of PAH without external heating, which is potentially valuable in the development of cost-effective gas cleaning process for the removal of PAHs in vehicle applications during cold start conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
