The effects of the welding arc on the air temperature rise and oxygen (O2) concentration in the chamber were also investigated. The measuring points for these items were located in the presumed breathing zone of a welder in a confined space. The time averaged concentrations of welding fumes, ozone and CO during the arcing time were 83.55 mg/m3, 0.203 ppm and 0.006%, respectively, at a welding current of 120A-200A. These results suggest serious exposure of a welder who operates in a confined space. Air temperature in the chamber rose remarkably due to the arc heat and the increase in the welding current. No clear decrease in the O2 concentration in the chamber was recognized during this welding operation. A model of air duct ventilation was constructed in the small chamber to investigate the strategy of effective ventilation for hazardous welding contaminants in a confined space. With this model we examined ventilation efficiency with a flow rate of 1.08-1.80 m3/min (ventilation rate for 0.40-0.67 air exchanges per minute) in the chamber, and proved that the exposure level was not drastically reduced during arcing time by this air duct ventilation, but the residual contaminants were rapidly exhausted after the welding operation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Industrial Health, Kawasaki, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ojima", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibata", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwasaki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "2985065R", "ISSNLinking": "0019-8366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Workplace"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10680307", "10.2486/indhealth.38.24"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
