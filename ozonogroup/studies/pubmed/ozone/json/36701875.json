However, its impact on the metabolome and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study first investigated the serum metabolite changes in rats exposed to 0.5\u00a0ppm\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> for 3 months using untargeted metabolomic approach. Results showed chronic ozone exposure significantly altered the serum levels of 34 metabolites with potential increased risk of digestive, respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, bile acid synthesis and secretion, and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism became the most prominent affected metabolic pathways after O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Further studies on the mechanisms found that the elevated serum toxic bile acid was not due to the increased biosynthesis in the liver, but the reduced reuptake from the portal vein to hepatocytes owing to repressed Ntcp and Oatp1a1, and the decreased bile acid efflux in hepatocytes as a results of inhibited Bsep, Ostalpha and Ostbeta. Meanwhile, decreased expressions of detoxification enzyme of SULT2A1 and the important regulators of FXR, PXR and HNF4\u03b1 also contributed to the abnormal bile acids. In addition, O<sub>3</sub> promoted the conversion of AA into thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and 20-hydroxyarachidonic acid (20-HETE) in the liver by up-regulation of Fads2, Cyp4a and Tbxas1 which resulting in decreased AA and linoleic acid (LA), and increased thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 20-HETE in the serum. Furthermore, apparent hepatic chronic inflammation, fibrosis and abnormal function were found in ozone-exposed rats. These results indicated chronic ozone exposure could alter serum metabolites by interfering their metabolism in the liver, and inducing liver injury to aggravate metabolic disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
