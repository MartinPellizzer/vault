Among these drugs, the occurrence of benzimidazoles, a class of antiparasitics for human and veterinary use, has been reported in WWTP effluents and surface waters. In this study, an SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and optimized for extraction and quantitation of benzimidazoles in influents and effluents of a local WWTP and in hospital wastewater. The extraction procedure was optimized using response surface methodology (Box-Behnken design) and the optimal parameters were as follows: 2.0\u202fmL of loading solvent consisting of a mixture of water:methanol (95:5, v/v) and temperature at 43\u202f\u00b0C. In hospital wastewater, albendazole (ABZ) and its principal metabolite ricobendazole (RBZ) were the main benzimidazole-related contaminants and were found at concentrations of up to 3810 and 3894\u202fng\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The WWTP system was able to remove from 46% to 95% of the ABZ quantified in the influent, discharging an effluent with 16-441\u202fng\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of ABZ. The concentrations of other benzimidazoles and metabolites in the WWTP effluents remained below 350\u202fng\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>. WWTP effluents fortified with 50\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of ABZ required 26.7 mg<sub>O3</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> to remove ABZ and RBZ. After ozonation, the COD and BOD<sub>5</sub> of the effluents were reduced by 27%. Photolysis by UVA radiation was not effective to remove ABZ and FBZ from the effluent samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
