This study mainly discussed the bacterial community shift in response to the treatment process of OFBR-MBR. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were dominant bacteria after ozone treatment in phylum level in OFBR-MBR; Aciditerrimonas, Blastopirellula, Pasteuria, Planctomyces, Paracoccus, Caldilinea and Defluviicoccus were adapted and enriched after ozone treatment in genus level in OFBR-MBR. Ozone played key role in the species selection of bacteria in OFBR-MBR. The chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium and total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency possessed by OFBR-MBR were 79.05%, 98.74% and 38.10%, which due to the function of ozone and these enriched bacteria. OFBR-MBR has exhibited huge potential for municipal tail wastewater, and it would also provide an alternative and promising technology for other kinds of tail wastewater recycling in future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
