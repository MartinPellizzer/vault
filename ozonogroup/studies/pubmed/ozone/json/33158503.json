However, previous studies have not adequately compared whether air pollution is a stronger risk factor for hospitalization or mortality. This study aimed to investigate differences in H-M risk from short-term ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures, and determine whether differences are modified by season, age, and sex.", "Daily ozone, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, temperature, and all-cause H-M counts (ICD-10, A00-R99) were collected for 22-24 Canadian cities for up to 29 years. Generalized additive Poisson models were employed to estimate associations between each pollutant and health outcome, which were compared across season (warm, cold, or year-round), age (all ages or seniors\u00a0>\u00a065), and sex.", "Overall, ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed higher season-specific risk of mortality than hospitalization: warm-season ozone: 0.54% (95% credible interval, 0.20, 0.85) vs. 0.14% (0.02, 0.27) per 10\u00a0ppb; and year-round PM<sub>2.5</sub>: 0.90% (0.33, 1.41) vs. 0.29% (0.03, 0.56) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. While age showed little H-M difference, sex appeared to be a modifier of H-M risk. While females had higher mortality risk, males had higher hospitalization risk: for females, ozone 0.87% (0.36, 1.35) vs.\u00a0-0.03% (-0.18, 0.11) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> 1.19% (0.40, 1.90) vs. 0.19% (-0.10, 0.47); and for males ozone 0.20% (-0.28, 0.65) vs. 0.35% (0.18, 0.51).", "This study found H-M differences attributable to ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, suggesting that both are stronger risk factors for mortality than hospitalization.
