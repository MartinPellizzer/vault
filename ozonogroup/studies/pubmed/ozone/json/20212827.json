In essence, the measurement becomes one of using wavelength in place of solar zenith angle as the independent variable. Practical and physical limitations restrict the variable-wavelength method to solar zenith angles 75 degrees < theta(0) < 90 degrees . Solution residual variance and correlation criteria are used to judge the statistical information content of each method in order to establish a degree of equivalence between the two. As a check on the validity of the theoretical approach, a limited eigenvalue analysis is performed on the synthesized Umkehr observations, and this is compared with eigenanalyses on real Umkehr data reported by other investigators. The over-all results of the present investigation indicate that the variable-wavelength method possesses the potential for deducing vertical ozone profiles at least equivalent to, if not slightly better than, profiles deduced by the standard Umkehr method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deluisi", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20212827", "10.1364/AO.18.003190", "23391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
