Saline was injected into the hind paws of half of these rats, and FCA was injected into the other half. At the end of two weeks, 40 \u03bcg of O3 was administered to nine rats from each group twice a week for seven total doses. The rats were followed-up in terms of clinical findings. At the sixth week, the rats were sacrificed and serum malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase levels were measured. In addition, ankle joints were separated for histopathological examination.", "Significant improvement was observed in terms of hind-paw diameter, severity of arthritis, and histopathological findings of inflammation after O3 treatment in the group with FCA-induced arthritis. Although it was not quite significant, an upward trend was detected in oxidative stress markers with O3 treatment.", "This study, the first to investigate the effects of systemic O3 on the clinical and histopathological outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis, indicates that O3 is a highly effective and reliable treatment method in FCA-induced arthritis in animal models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Medical Faculty of Adnan Menderes University, Ayd\u0131n, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ta\u015f\u00e7i Bozba\u015f", "ForeName": "G\u00fclnur", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical Faculty of Adnan Menderes University, Ayd\u0131n, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yilmaz", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pa\u015fao\u011flu", "ForeName": "Esra", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Medical Faculty of Adnan Menderes University, Ayd\u0131n, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcrer", "ForeName": "G\u00fclcan", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Medical Faculty of Adnan Menderes University, Ayd\u0131n, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivgin", "ForeName": "Rasime", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Pharmacology, Medical Faculty of Adnan Menderes University, Ayd\u0131n, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demirci", "ForeName": "Buket", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Arch Rheumatol", "NlmUniqueID": "101639000", "ISSNLinking": "2148-5046"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The authors declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bocci VA.
