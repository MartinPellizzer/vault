To obtain the experimental data set, the model soil (sand) is combined with an initial anthracene concentration of 3.24mg/g and treated by ozone (with the ozone initial concentration 16mg/L) during 90min in a reactor by the \"fluid bed\" principle. The anthracene degradation degree was controlled by UV-vis spectrophotometry and HPLC techniques. Based on the HPLC data, the obtained results confirm that anthracene may be decomposed completely in the solid phase by simple ozonation during 20min and by-products of ozonation are started to be destroyed after 30min of treatment. In the ozonation process the ozone concentration in the gas phase at the reactor outlet is registered by an ozone detector. The variation of this parameter is used to obtain the summary characteristic curve of the anthracene ozonation (ozonogram). Then, using the experimental decomposition dynamics of anthracene and the ozonogram, the proposed DNNO is trained to reconstruct the anthracene decomposition and to estimate the anthracene ozonation constant using the DNN technique and a modified Least Square method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Superior School of Chemical Engineering, National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (ESIQIE-IPN,), Edif. 7, UPALM, C.P. 07738, Mexico D.F., Mexico. tpoznyak@ipn.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poznyak", "ForeName": "Tatyana", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Alejandro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chairez", "ForeName": "Isaac", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez", "ForeName": "Miriam", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poznyak", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthracenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EH46A1TLD7", "NameOfSubstance": "anthracene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anthracenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17560024", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.04.103", "S0304-3894(07)00562-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
