Catalyst samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) method. Removal efficiency of RhB was significantly promoted at the presence of ozonation/CuO@CNTs compared with that of ozonation alone, ozonation/pure CNTs, and ozonation with CuO-coating CNTs catalyst (CuO/CNTs). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrated that CNTs provided a confined environment to promote the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radical, making the ozonation process more efficient. This study provided a possible treatment approach for organic pollutants by using CNTs-confined nanocatalysts in aqueous solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Wu", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Jingyao", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Retracted Publication"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Langmuir. 2010 May 4;26(9):6864. doi: 10.1021/la101104k", "PMID": "20420465"}, {"RefSource": "Langmuir. 2011 Sep 20;27(18):11729.", "PMID": "22016890"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20420460", "10.1021/la902424z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
