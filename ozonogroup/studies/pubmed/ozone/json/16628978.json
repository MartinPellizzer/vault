Waukesha County, Wis was selected as 1 of 7 sites to spearhead this ambitious undertaking. Residents of Waukesha County may experience different kinds of environmental exposures from water, land, and air based on where they live, work, and play. A selected number of Waukesha County's environmental exposures described briefly in this report will serve the NCS well with their heterogeneity of potential exposures: from private well water and community water supplies that obtain water from both surface and groundwater; from the variable exposures to ambient air pollution from mobile sources, local industrial sources, and distant sources (ozone); and the different levels of exposures from soil and dust depending on the prevalence of pesticide use and lead-based paints. By combining data gathered from Waukesha County's participants with other study sites, a holistic picture of environmental exposures in the United States can be evaluated as it influences the health of our nation's children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Children's Study-Waukesha County Vanguard Center, USA. jamcelroy@wisc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McElroy", "ForeName": "Jane A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Henry A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Durkin", "ForeName": "Maureen S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cronk", "ForeName": "Christine E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "WMJ", "NlmUniqueID": "9716054", "ISSNLinking": "1098-1861"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Welfare"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "National Institutes of Health (U.S.)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Preventive Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wisconsin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16628978"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
