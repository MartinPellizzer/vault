Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9442-8109"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "LastName": "Prather", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY 12237, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, University at Albany, Albany, NY 12237, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38991055", "10.1126/science.adn0415"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
