Previously unrecognized agricultural emissions may explain why O(3) concentrations in the SJV have not responded to traditional emissions control programs. In the present study, the ozone formation potentials (OFP) of livestock feed emissions were measured on representative field samples using a transportable smog chamber. Seven feeds were considered: cereal silage (wheat grain and oat grain), alfalfa silage, corn silage, high moisture ground corn (HMGC), almond shells, almond hulls, and total mixed ration (TMR = 55% corn silage, 16% corn grain, 8% almond hulls, 7% hay, 7% bran + seeds, and 5% protein + vitamins + minerals). The measured short-term OFP for each gram of reactive organic gas (ROG) emissions from all livestock feed was 0.17-0.41 g-O(3) per g-ROG. For reference, OFP of exhaust from light duty gasoline powered cars under the same conditions is 0.69 +/- 0.15 g-O(3) per g-ROG. Model calculations were able to reproduce the ozone formation from animal feeds indicating that the measured ROG compounds account for the observed ozone formation (i.e., ozone closure was achieved). Ethanol and other alcohol species accounted for more than 50% of the ozone formation for most types of feed. Aldehydes were also significant contributors for cereal silage, high moisture ground corn, and total mixed ration. Ozone production calculations based on feed consumption rates, ROG emissions rates, and OFP predict that animal feed emissions dominate the ROG contributions to ozone formation in the SJV with total production of 25 +/- 10 t O(3) day(-1). The next most significant ROG source of ozone production in the SJV is estimated to be light duty vehicles with total production of 14.3 +/- 1.4 t O(3) day(-1). The majority of the animal feed ozone formation is attributed to corn silage. Future work should be conducted to reduce the uncertainty of ROG emissions from animal feeds in the SJV and to include this significant source of ozone formation in regional airshed models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Howard", "ForeName": "Cody J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Anuj", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malkina", "ForeName": "Irina", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitloehner", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Peter G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flocchini", "ForeName": "Robert G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleeman", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Domestic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20192169", "10.1021/es902864u"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
