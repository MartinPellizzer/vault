Chlorofluorocarbon in expanded polystyrene ware was analysed using headspace gas chromatography in the flame ionization mode, and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The amount of extractive residue leached from this type of polymeric material was determined using an aqueous medium simulating categories of food and beverages. A wide range of concentrations of CFC-12 (dichlorodifluorocarbon) was detected in the styrofoam ware. It fluctuated between a low of 32 ppm and a high of 35471 ppm in two different samples of styrofoam plates. Similarly, the highest and lowest levels of extractive residue detected in two different styrofoam plates were 54 ppm and 0.5 ppm respectively. CFC-22 or HCFC (chlorodifluorocarbon) was absent from these expanded polystyrene ware. The continued use of chlorofluorocarbons as a blowing agent will further exert a deleterious effect on the stratospheric ozone layer. Though the level of water extractive residue from these expanded polystyrene ware was relatively safe, public health could be further safe-guarded through improvmeents in raw material selection and mode of production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Scientific Services, National Blood Centre, Outram Road, 0316, Republic of Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sam", "ForeName": "C T", "Initials": "CT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chua", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1987 Nov 27;238(4831):1258-60", "ArticleIdList": ["17744363"]}, {"Citation": "J Assoc Off Anal Chem. 1981 Sep;64(5):1122-30", "ArticleIdList": ["7287610"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24233957", "10.1007/BF00401329"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
