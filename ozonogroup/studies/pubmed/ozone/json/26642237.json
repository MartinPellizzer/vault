In the oil sands, primarily over an area of intensive surface mining, NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) are seen to be increasing by as much as 10%/year, with the location of the largest trends in a newly developing NO2 \"lobe\" well removed from surface monitoring stations. SO2 VCDs in the oil sands have remained approximately constant. The only other significant increase in the region was seen in NO2 over Bakken gas fields in North Dakota which showed increases of up to 5%/yr. By contrast, other locations in the region show substantial declines in both pollutants, providing strong evidence to the efficacy of environmental pollution control measures implemented by both nations. The OMI-derived trends were found to be consistent with those from the Canadian surface monitoring network, although in the case of SO2, it was necessary to apply a correction in order to remove the residual signal from volcanic eruptions present in the OMI data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada , Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "McLinden", "ForeName": "Chris A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada , Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Fioletov", "ForeName": "Vitali", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, United States."}], "LastName": "Krotkov", "ForeName": "Nickolay A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, University of Maryland College Park, Maryland 20742, United States."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Can", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) , De Bilt 3731 GA, The Netherlands."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Meteorology and Air Quality, Wageningen University , Wageningen 6708 PB, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Boersma", "ForeName": "K Folkert", "Initials": "KF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada , Toronto, Ontario M3H 5T4, Canada."}], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "Cristen", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North Dakota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Fields"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26642237", "10.1021/acs.est.5b04985"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
