Gases lead to hypoxia and respiratory compromise, ozone to increased respiratory illnesses and decreased mental acuity, and mercury to prenatal cognitive disabilities and antisocial behaviors. Lead toxicity is associated with developmental delays. Cadmium is linked with cancer. The smaller sizes of air pollution particulate matter are pathogenic and are associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and nervous system disorders. Bisphenol A is being studied for possible links to cancer and pregnancy risks. Physicians should be aware of these dangers, especially in underserved communities and populations. Investigating possible environmental risks and education are key."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
