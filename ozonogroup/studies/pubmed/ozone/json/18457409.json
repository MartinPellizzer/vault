The bonding is achieved through reactions between two complementary polymer coatings, poly(4-aminomethyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) and poly(4-formyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene), which are prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of the corresponding [2.2]paracyclophanes and can be deposited on complementary microfluidic units to be bonded. These CVD-based polymer films form well-adherent coatings on a range of different substrate materials including polymers, glass, silicon, metals, or paper and can be stored for extended periods prior to bonding without losing their bonding capability. Tensile stress data are measured on PDMS with various substrates and compared favorably to current methods such as oxygen plasma and UV/ozone. Sum frequency generation (SFG) has been used to probe the presence of amine and aldehyde groups on the surface after CVD polymerization and their conversion during bonding. In addition to bonding, unreacted functional groups present on the luminal surface of microfluidic channels provide free chemical groups for further surface modification. Fluorescently labeled molecules including rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin and atto-655 NHS ester were used to verify the presence of active functional groups on the luminal surfaces after bonding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hsien-Yeh", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McClelland", "ForeName": "Arthur A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lahann", "ForeName": "Joerg", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adhesives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylpolysiloxanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63148-62-9", "NameOfSubstance": "baysilon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Adhesives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylpolysiloxanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tensile Strength"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18457409", "10.1021/ac800341m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
