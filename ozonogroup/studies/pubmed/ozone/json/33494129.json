Considering this demand, we have constructed a database, named the Allergic Disease Database, based on the National Health Insurance Database (NHID). The NHID contains information on demographic and medical service utilization for approximately 99% of the Korean population. This study targeted 3 major allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. For the target diseases, our database provides daily medical service information, including the number of daily visits from 2013 and 2017, categorized by patients' characteristics such as address, sex, age, and duration of residence. We provide additional information, including yearly population, a number of patients, and averaged geocoding coordinates by eup, myeon, and dong district code (the smallest-scale administrative units in Korea). This information enables researchers to analyze how daily changes in the environmental factors of allergic diseases (e.g., particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and ozone) in certain regions would influence patients' behavioral patterns of medical service utilization. Moreover, researchers can analyze long-term trends in allergic diseases and the health effects caused by environmental factors such as daily climate and pollution data. The advantages of this database are easy access to data, additional levels of geographic detail, time-efficient data-refining and processing, and a de-identification process that minimizes the exposure of identifiable personal information. All datasets included in the Allergic Disease Database can be downloaded by accessing the National Health Insurance Service data sharing webpage (https://nhiss.nhis.or.kr)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of ICT Convergence System Engineering, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Sunyong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong-Wook", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Young-Eun", "Initials": "YE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Benefits Strategy, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong Heon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yeon-Yong", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Kyu-Dong", "Initials": "KD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Gwon", "ForeName": "Mi-Ji", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Jae-In", "Initials": "JI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Big Data Department, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Eun-Joo", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Epidemiol Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101519472", "ISSNLinking": "2092-7193"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "National Health Programs"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare for this study."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Dockery DW, Pope CA, 3rd, Xu X, Spengler JD, Ware JH, Fay ME, et al.
