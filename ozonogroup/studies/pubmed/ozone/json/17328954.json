In this paper we develop an aggregate Air Quality Index (AQI) based on the combined effects of five criteria pollutants (CO, SO2, NO2, O3 and PM10) taking into account the European standards. We evaluate it for each monitoring station and for the whole area of Athens, Greece, an area with serious air pollution problems. A comparison was made with a modified version of Environmental Protection Agency/USA (USEPA) maximum value AQI model adjusted for European conditions. Hourly data of air pollutants from 4 monitoring stations, available during 1983-1999, were analysed for the development of the proposed index. The analysis reveals the Athenian population exposure reaches high levels and during last years a gradual increase of days with unhealthy conditions was detected. The proposed aggregate model estimates more effectively the exposure of citizens comparing with the modified USEPA maximum value model, because counts the impact of all the pollutants measured. Towards the informing and protection of the citizens in an urban agglomeration this model advantages as a political and administrative tool for the design of abatement strategies and effective measures of intervention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Technical University of Athens, Department of Chemical Engineering, Herroon Polytechniou 9, Polytechnioupolis, GR-15784, Zografos, Athens, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kyrkilis", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaloulakou", "ForeName": "Arhontoula", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kassomenos", "ForeName": "Pavlos A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Int", "NlmUniqueID": "7807270", "ISSNLinking": "0160-4120"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17328954", "10.1016/j.envint.2007.01.010", "S0160-4120(07)00015-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
