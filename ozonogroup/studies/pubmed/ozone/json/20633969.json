These stagnant conditions are occasionally interrupted by North-F\u00f6hn events, which cause a drop in relative humidity and an increase in O3 levels, indicating the mixing of local and free troposphere air flows. In this study the influence of the North-F\u00f6hn on concentrations of tracer organic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PM10, O3 and black carbon (BC) was studied during a North-F\u00f6hn event in November 2007. Large fluctuations in the concentration of these compounds, as well as changes in PM(10) composition due to daytime and night-time variations of local source emissions were observed. Although these events occur at low frequencies (6-10%) they can for short periods, strongly affect the regional air quality by quickly decreasing the concentrations of these tracer organic compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
