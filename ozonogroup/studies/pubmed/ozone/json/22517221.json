Recent theoretical calculations suggest that fast photolysis of these compounds may be an important OH source in high-isoprene, low-NO regions. We report experimental constraints for key parameters of photolysis, OH reaction and ozone reaction of these compounds as derived from a closely-related, custom-synthesized C(6)-HPALD. The photolysis quantum yield is 1.0 \u00b1 0.4 over the range 300-400 nm, assuming an absorption cross section equal to the average of those measured for several analogous enals. The yield of OH from photolysis was determined as 1.0 \u00b1 0.8. The OH reaction rate constant is (5.1 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 296 K. The ozone reaction rate constant is (1.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10(-18) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 296 K. These results are consistent with previous first-principles estimates, though the nature and fate of secondary oxidation products remains uncertain. Incorporation of C(5)-HPALD chemistry with the above parameters in a 0-D box model, along with experimentally-constrained rates for C(5)-HPALD production from isomerization of first-generation isoprene hydroxyperoxy radicals, is found to enhance modeled OH concentrations by 5-16% relative to the traditional isoprene oxidation mechanism for the chemical regimes of recent observational studies in rural and remote regions. This enhancement in OH will increase if C(5)-HPALD photo-oxidation products also photolyze to yield additional OH or if the C(5)-HPALD production rate is faster than has been observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA. gwolfe@chem.wisc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolfe", "ForeName": "Glenn M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crounse", "ForeName": "John D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parrish", "ForeName": "Jonathan D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "St Clair", "ForeName": "Jason M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beaver", "ForeName": "Melinda R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paulot", "ForeName": "Fabien", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Tehshik P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wennberg", "ForeName": "Paul O", "Initials": "PO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keutsch", "ForeName": "Frank N", "Initials": "FN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22517221", "10.1039/c2cp40388a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
