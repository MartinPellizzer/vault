Several pollutants have been associated with 25(OH)D, but have not been considered in the context of chemical co-exposures. We aimed to determine associations between a broad mixture of prenatal environmental chemical exposures and 25(OH)D concentrations in mid-pregnancy. Stored mid-pregnancy serum samples were assayed from 421 women delivering live births in Southern California in 2000-2003. 25(OH)D, six BFRs, eleven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and two organochlorine pesticides were detected in \u226560% of specimens. Gestational exposures to airborne particulate matter\u00a0\u2264\u00a010 \u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) and\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone concentrations were derived from monitoring station data. Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) analyses estimated overall mixture and individual chemical associations accounting for co-exposures and covariates with mean 25(OH)D levels, and BHM was used to estimate associations with insufficient (<75 nMol/L) 25(OH)D levels. Non-mixture associations for each chemical were estimated with linear and logistic models. PM<sub>10</sub> [BHM estimate: -0.133\u00a0nmol/l 95% Credible Interval (-0.240, -0.026)] was associated with lower 25(OH)D in BHM and BKMR. Higher quantiles of combined exposures were associated with lower 25(OH)D, though with wide credible intervals. In non-mixture models, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO, and NO<sub>2</sub> were associated with lower concentrations, while O<sub>3</sub> and PBDE153 were associated with higher 25(OH)D and/or lower insufficiency. While some chemicals were associated with increased and others with decreased 25(OH)D concentrations, the overall mixture was associated with lower concentrations. Mixture analyses differed from non-mixture regressions, highlighting the importance of mixtures approaches for estimating real-world associations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
