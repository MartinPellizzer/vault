Most of the studies examining the effects of air pollution on comorbidity visits were from Northern American countries, with scarce literature from Asia. This study contributes to existing, yet limited understanding of air pollution-comorbidity by examining the effects of daily air pollutants on outpatient single morbidity and comorbid cardiorespiratory visits in Japan. A total of 1,452,505 outpatient cardiorespiratory visits were recorded among the 21 Japanese cities from 2013 to 2016. Daily outpatient cardiorespiratory visit data were obtained from a health insurance claims database managed by the Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd. (JMDC). A time-stratified case crossover analysis coupled with Generalized Additive Mixed Model was used to analyze the association of daily air pollutants (particulate matter 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm or less in diameter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide) on daily single (respiratory and cardiovascular) and comorbidity health outcomes. We further examined single and cumulative effects for 0-3 and 0-14 lag periods. Ozone, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were positively associated with cardiorespiratory visits in either shorter or longer lags, with more apparent comorbidity associations with NO<sub>2</sub> exposure. A 10-unit increase in NO<sub>2</sub>, after adjusting for ozone, was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.34-3.15) and 6.49% (95% CI: 5.00-8.01) increase in comorbidity visit at Lag 0 (of Lag 0-3) and cumulative lag 0-3, respectively. Our results contribute to existing evidence suggesting that short-term and extended exposure to air pollution elicit health risks on cardiovascular, respiratory and comorbid clinic visits. Exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, in particular, was associated with increase in the risk of single and comorbidity cardiorespiratory visits. Results can be potentially utilized for both individual health (e.g. risk population health management) and health facility management (e.g. health visit influx determination)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
