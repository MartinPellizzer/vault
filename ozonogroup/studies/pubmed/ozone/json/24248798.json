Sulfur dioxide and black smoke should be measured too, in six more areas of the metropolitan Oporto."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculdade de Engenharia, Centro de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica (INIC), Rua dos Bragas, 4099, Porto Codex, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferraz", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferraz", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24248798", "10.1007/BF00394511"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
