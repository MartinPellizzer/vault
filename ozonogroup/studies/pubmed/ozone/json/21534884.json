To assess the risks of maternal inhalation exposure to ozone (O(3)), timed pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to different concentrations of O(3) (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2\u2009ppm) for 4\u2009h/day for 10 days during gestation (GD9-GD18), and pulmonary inflammation and immune responses were assessed in the offspring at 6 weeks-of-age. Maternal O(3) exposure reduced the number of productive dams by 25% at the highest O(3) concentration (1.2\u2009ppm) and decreased the rate of weight gain in the offspring. Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to bovine serum albumin were suppressed in the female offspring by maternal exposure to the two highest concentrations of O(3), whereas humoral immune responses to sheep red blood cells were not altered in either sex. Maternal exposure to 1.2\u2009ppm O(3) increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the offspring but did not affect the number of inflammatory cells or levels of total protein, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and IL-4 cytokines in BALF, or CD4(+), CD8(+), CD25(+), and TCR\u03b2(+)CD1d(+) T-cells in the spleen. Offspring born from air-exposed dams sensitized early in life (postnatal day [PND] 3) to ovalbumin (OVA) antigen and then challenged as adults developed eosinophilia, elevated levels of LDH activity and total protein in BALF, and increased pulmonary responsiveness to methacholine, compared with animals sensitized at PND42. Maternal O(3) exposure in the 1.2\u2009ppm O(3) group decreased BALF eosinophilia and serum OVA-specific IgE in the female offspring sensitized early in life but did not affect development of allergic airway inflammation by offspring sensitized late in life. In summary, maternal exposure to O(3) affected reproductive outcome and produced modest decreases in immune function and indicators of allergic lung disease in surviving offspring."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiopulmonary and Immunotoxicology Branch, Environmental Public Health Division, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharkhuu", "ForeName": "Tuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doerfler", "ForeName": "Donald L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Copeland", "ForeName": "Carey", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luebke", "ForeName": "Robert W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilmour", "ForeName": "M Ian", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101201960", "ISSNLinking": "1547-691X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, CD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, CD"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophilia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21534884", "10.3109/1547691X.2011.568978"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
