These provisions required installation of reasonably available control technology (RACT) for NOx emissions for major stationary sources in the Ozone Transport Region and in more stringently classified ozone nonattainment areas. Standard approaches using nonattainment designation to identify regulatory impacts abstract from important implementation aspects such as when regulatory changes occur, where regulations are in effect, and which specific regulations apply. Omitting these factors can introduce bias by contaminating the control group, leading to underestimation of historical employment impacts and overestimation of projected impacts from tightening regulations. Our results indicate that the new NOx RACT requirements negatively impacted power plant employment. We find no significant impacts on generation, suggesting that installation of pollution controls may have contributed to labor-saving technical change at affected units."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arizona State University, School of Politics and Global Studies, gsheriff@asu.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheriff", "ForeName": "Glenn", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW (1809T), Washington, DC 20460, ferris.ann@epa.gov."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferris", "ForeName": "Ann E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW (1809T), Washington, DC 20460, shadbegian.ron@epa.gov."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shadbegian", "ForeName": "Ronald J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Assoc Environ Resour Econ", "NlmUniqueID": "101743533", "ISSNLinking": "2333-5955"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Auffhammer Maximilian, Bento Antonio M., and Lowe Scott E.. 2009. \u201cMeasuring the effects of the Clean Air Act Amendments on ambient PM10 concentrations: The critical importance of a spatially disaggregated analysis.\u201d Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 58: 15\u201326."}, {"Citation": "Becker R 2005. \u201cAir pollution abatement costs under the Clean Air Act: Evidence from the PACE survey.\u201d Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 50: 144\u2013169."}, {"Citation": "Becker R, and Henderson J. 2000. \u201cEffects of air quality regulation on polluting industries.\u201d Journal of Political Economy, 108: 379\u2013421."}, {"Citation": "Berman Eli, and Bui Linda. 2001. \u201cEnvironmental regulation and labor demand: Evidence from the South Coast Air Basin.\u201d Journal of Public Economics, 79(2): 265\u2013295."}, {"Citation": "Burtraw Dallas, and Evans David A. 2004. \u201cNOx emissions in the United States: A potpourri of policies\u201d In Choosing Environmental Policy: Comparing Instruments and Outcomes in the United States and Europe., ed.
