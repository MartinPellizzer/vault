This study examines the results of the performance of photo-induced oxidation, heterogeneous photocatalysis, ozonation and peroxone in degrading the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (CIP) in a hospital effluent. The real samples were collected from the treatment system of the University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM). Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) was used to monitor the decrease of the CIP concentration. As expected, photo-induced oxidation was much slower than the other processes in bringing about total CIP degradation. Both heterogeneous photocatalysis and peroxone led to almost complete CIP degradation after 60 min treatment. Ozonation showed the best performance: total degradation after 30 min treatment. This was an unexpected result in view of the greater capacity of the other two processes to generate hydroxyl radicals. However, this finding supports a result in the literature that has tended to be overlooked. The by-products formed during the application of the processes were found to be very similar. Moreover, on the basis of the data obtained from the literature, there is some evidence to suggest that the by-products are derived from the oxidation of the piperazine group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, 97105-900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil. tgvasconcelos@lamic.ufsm.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vasconcelos", "ForeName": "Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00fcmmerer", "ForeName": "Klaus", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henriques", "ForeName": "Danielle M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Ayrton F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluoroquinolones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5E8K9I0O4U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluoroquinolones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19428183", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.03.143", "S0304-3894(09)00543-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
