However, there are few reports concerning on the CFCs' latitudinal dependence. Relying on the longterm monitoring that has been performed in Shanghai from 1997 and Cooperating with the Chinese Third Antarctic Inland Ice-sheet Traversal Party, we did intensive sampling in the southern hemisphere from the beginning of November to the end of December in 1998 and then got the corresponding concentrations of CFC-12, CFC-11, and CFC-113 according to the latitude. The data were studied inductively in accordance with the geographical location and meteorological condition of every sampling point. In summary, the average concentrations of CFCs (refer to CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-113) in equatorial area are the highest in the southern hemisphere; however, the concentrations in prevailing west-wind belt and polar east-wind belt are much lower and at the same levels, which should be a perfect implication of the mean background in the southern hemisphere. Being related to the special polar circumfluence, the concentrations of CFCs on the glacier reveal a special rise. Compared with the mean background of the southern hemisphere that is represented by the data of the prevailing west-wind belt and Polar east-wind belt, the concentrations in Shanghai bear the same level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yaoshiyuki", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11432545", "10.1021/es001268t"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
