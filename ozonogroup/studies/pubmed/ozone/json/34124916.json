The most significant point of membrane separation is the resistance against membrane fouling. Fabricating hierarchical architectures on the membrane surface is an available approach to improving its anti-fouling property. In this study, ZnO nanoneedles were successfully anchored onto surface-sulfonated poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) felt via UV/ozone cleaning and hydrothermal synthesis. The modified felt (PEEK-f-Z) showed much better anti-fouling properties and far higher rejection height (33 cm) than the unmodified felt (17 cm) with a separation efficiency up to 99.99%. The enhanced separation properties could be attributed to the stronger water locking capability of the hierarchical architectures on the surface. Furthermore, benefiting from the great chemical stability of PEEK substrates and ZnO nanoneedles, the as-prepared membrane exhibited admirable solvent resistance, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. As a result, PEEK-f-Z could even separate immiscible organic liquids with different polarities and collect hot water from the oil/water mixture, promising to be used under severe conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Synthetic Technology of High Performance Polymer, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute, Shanghai 200120, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Synthetic Technology of High Performance Polymer, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China."}], "LastName": "Luan", "ForeName": "Jiashuang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0001-566X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Synthetic Technology of High Performance Polymer, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xuanbo", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7802-4411"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Synthetic Technology of High Performance Polymer, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Jinhui", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzophenones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31694-16-3", "NameOfSubstance": "polyetheretherketone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SOI2LOH54Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzophenones"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Biofouling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zinc Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34124916", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c00838"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
