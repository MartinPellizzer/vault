The medium age of these patients was 62 +/- 4.5 years old. They were randomly included into four groups. Three were treated with Ozone: one of them by endovenous way, other intramuscular way, and the last one by rectal way; meanwhile, in the fourth group the patients were submitted to conventional medical treatment (control group). In the three ozone-groups there weren't differences when they were compared between then. But there was a significant improvement in comparison with the control group. The claudication distance in the treadmill increased to the 2.5 km/hour. Ankle/arm pressure rates hadn't significant differences, this corroborates the ozone action on the microcirculation. The least uncomfortable, the more harmless and the more economic way was the rectal way."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Angiolog\u00eda y Cirug\u00eda Vascular, La Habana, Cuba."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romero Vald\u00e9s", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blanco Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Men\u00e9ndez Cepero", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez Moraleda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ley Pozo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"], "VernacularTitle": "Ateroesclerosis obliterante y ozonoterapia.
