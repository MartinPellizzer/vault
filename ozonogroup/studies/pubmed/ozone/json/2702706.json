The activities of lung cytosol and liver microsomes with methyl linoleate ozonide (MLO) were found to be high relative to the activity demonstrated by liver cytosol, as compared with their respective activities towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Only a slight catalytic activity towards the ozonide was noticed for rat lung microsomes. Isoenzyme 2-2 exhibited the highest specific activity (208 nmol/min/mg) when isoenzymes 1-1, 1-2, 2-2, 3-3, 3-4, 4-4 and 7-7 were compared. This isoenzyme accounts for approx. 25% of cytosolic GST protein in rat lung, while in rat liver it represents approx. 9%. This may partly explain the high activity towards the ozonide noticed for rat lung cytosol. No stable conjugates were formed as products of the reaction of MLO with glutathione; although two glutathione-conjugates were noticed on TLC, they were only formed as intermediate compounds. Coupling of an aldehyde dehydrogenase assay or a glutathione reductase assay to the GST-catalyzed conjugation, demonstrated that oxidized glutathione and aldehydes are formed as the major products in the reaction. To further confirm the formation of aldehydes, the products of the GST-catalyzed reaction were incubated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, which resulted in hydrazone formation. In conclusion, the activity of the GST towards the ozonide of methyl linoleate is similar to their peroxidase activity with lipid hydroperoxides as substrates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vos", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rietjens", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Bladeren", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Linoleic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H5SRK63OL7", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl linoleate ozonide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linoleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2702706", "10.1016/0009-2797(89)90084-7", "0009-2797(89)90084-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
