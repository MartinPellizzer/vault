Herein, we developed a comprehensive suspect and nontarget screening workflow based on high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify unknown antibiotic TPs in wastewater treatment plant effluents. We identified 211 compounds (35 parent antibiotics and 176 TPs) at confidence levels of \u22653 and 107 TPs originated from macrolides. TPs were quantified by 17 TPs standards and semiquantified by the predicted response factors and accounted for 55.6-95.1% (76.7% on average) of the total concentrations of parents and TPs. 22.2%, 63.1%, and 18.8% of the identified TPs were estimated to be more persistent, mobile, and toxic than their parent antibiotics, respectively. Further ecological risk assessment based on concentrations and toxicity to aquatic organisms revealed that the cumulative risks of TPs were generally higher than those of parents. Despite the newly formed N-oxide TPs, the tertiary treatment process (mainly ozonation) could decrease the averaged 20.3% of concentrations and 36.2% of the risks of antibiotic-related compounds. This study highlights the necessity to include antibiotic TPs in environmental scrutiny and risk assessment of antibiotics in different aquatic environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0626-8046"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of All Material Fluxes in River Ecosystems, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jingrun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of All Material Fluxes in River Ecosystems, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Yitao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9998-1205"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina 29634, United States."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5753-5976"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Si", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5064-0351"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Water and Sediment Sciences, Ministry of Education, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of All Material Fluxes in River Ecosystems, Beijing 100871, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Weiling", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macrolides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Macrolides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37930269", "10.1021/acs.est.3c05008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
