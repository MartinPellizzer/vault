The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of the structure of the hydrocarbon parent molecule on SOA formation for a homologous set of compounds. Aspects of the compound structures that are varied include the number of carbon atoms present in the cycloalkene ring (C5 to C8), the presence and location of methyl groups, and the presence of an exocyclic or endocyclic double bond. The specific compounds considered here are cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cycloheptene, cyclooctene, 1-methyl-1-cyclopentene, 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene, 1-methyl-1-cycloheptene, 3-methyl-1-cyclohexene, and methylenecyclohexane. The SOA yield is found to be a function of the number of carbons present in the cycloalkene ring, with an increasing number resulting in increased yield. The yield is enhanced by the presence of a methyl group located at a double-bonded site but reduced by the presence of a methyl group at a non-double-bonded site. The presence of an exocyclic double bond also leads to a reduced yield relative to that of the equivalent methylated cycloalkene. On the basis of these observations, the SOA yield for terpinolene relative to the other cyclic alkenes is qualitatively predicted, and this prediction compares well to measurements of the SOA yield from the ozonolysis of terpinolene. This work shows that relative SOA yields from ozonolysis of cyclic alkenes can be qualitatively predicted from properties of the parent hydrocarbons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Environmental Science and Engineering and of Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keywood", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varutbangkul", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bahreini", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flagan", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seinfeld", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cycloparaffins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dicarboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9830X5KSL", "NameOfSubstance": "terpinolene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexane Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cycloparaffins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dicarboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15352455", "10.1021/es035363o"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
