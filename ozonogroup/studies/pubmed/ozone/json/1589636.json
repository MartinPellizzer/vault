They contain fluorocarbons which are considered to be responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Inhalation through metered-dose inhalers can cause cough and bronchospasm. Moreover, metered-dose inhalers are difficult to handle. Errors in using these devices have been described in 30% to 70% of subjects, the incoordination between the actuation of the device and the inhalation being the most common. The author describes the Turbuhaler made of three parts (a reservoir for the powder, the dosing chamber and the inhalation channel) and the way it works. It has been shown that the efficacy of terbutaline (in mg/mg) is equivalent with the Turbuhaler and the metered-dose inhaled. Several studies that are reviewed by the author show that the Turbuhaler is the inhalation device that is the easiest to use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoires Astra-France, Nanterre."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braunstein", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Le Turbuhaler."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Rev Mal Respir", "NlmUniqueID": "8408032", "ISSNLinking": "0761-8425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1589636"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
