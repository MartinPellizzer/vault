In this study, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument data product was used as the source data, and the pixel space analysis method and grey correlation analysis method were utilized to examine the tropospheric ozone column concentration in Northeast China from 2010 to 2018. The results revealed that the ozone column concentration in Northeast China was relatively high compared to other parts of the country. The high-value areas were primarily distributed in Tahe County, Heihe City, Hegang City, and Qiqihar City. The temporal variation of the ozone column concentration in Northeast China exhibited an obvious periodicity of 9 years, and its interannual change displayed a downward trend. The maximum value occurred in 2010, and the minimum value was found in 2016. The seasonal changes manifested a relative trend of spring\u2009>\u2009winter\u2009>\u2009summer\u2009>\u2009autumn, which was contrary to the research results for other parts of China, which showed a summer maximum. Among the influencing factors, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, sunshine hours, GDP, and primary and secondary industries exhibited the closest relationships with ozone. The high concentration of ozone in Northeast China was determined to result from the superimposed effects of long-distance atmospheric transport and anthropogenic emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Zhuohong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9406-8641"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, 730070, China. 761866726@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Tianzhen", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu Industrial Vocational and Technical College, Lanzhou, 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Huiping", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Tunyang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Jiale", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ruirui", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Arnold, N.
