Traditional methods for lipid modifications involve physical and chemical approaches or enzymatic reactions, which often have limitations in terms of specificity, efficiency, and environmental impact. In recent years, nonconventional technologies have emerged as promising alternatives for lipid modifications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of nonconventional technologies for lipid modifications, including high-pressure processing, pulsed electric fields, ultrasound, ozonation, and cold plasma technology. The principles,mechanisms, and advantages of these technologies are discussed, along with their applications in lipid modification processes. Additionally, the challenges and future perspectives of nonconventional technologies in lipid modifications are addressed, highlighting the potential and challenges for further advancements in this field. The integration of nonconventional technologies with traditional methods has the potential to revolutionize lipid modifications, enabling the development of novel lipid-based products with enhanced functional properties and improved sustainability profiles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Science and Technology, School of Applied Sciences and Mathematics, Universiti Teknologi Brunei, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, Darussalam."}], "LastName": "Phuah", "ForeName": "Eng-Tong", "Initials": "ET"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Monash-Industry Plant Oils Research Laboratory, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yee-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Teck-Kim", "Initials": "TK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA."}], "LastName": "Akoh", "ForeName": "Casimir", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Food and Ecosystem Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."}], "LastName": "Cheong", "ForeName": "Ling-Zhi", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Food Science and Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Chin-Ping", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JNU-UPM International Joint Laboratory on Plant Oil Processing and Safety, Department of Food Science and Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioprocess Technology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia; email: omlai@upm.edu.my."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Laboratory on Plant Oils Processing and Safety, JNU-UPM, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Oi-Ming", "Initials": "OM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Annu Rev Food Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101561951", "ISSNLinking": "1941-1421"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Technology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38134384", "10.1146/annurev-food-072023-034440"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
