Moreover, the maximum incremental reactive method was employed to estimate the O<sub>3</sub>-formation potential contributed by VOCs, and health risks were assessed. Results showed that during the observation period, TVOCs concentrations ranged from 16.4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> to 1947.8 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> with an average concentration of 40.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, whereas the average proportions of alkanes, alkene/alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons were 66.2%, 25.9%, and 7.9%, respectively. The diurnal variation of total VOCs concentration showed a monomodal change, with a peak concentration of 127.9 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> at 07:00, whereas the TVOCs had an average ozone formation potential (OFP) of 249.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Analysis of OFP indicated that trans-2-butene and ethylene were the most important species in ozone production with accountabilities for total OFP of 153.4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Propylene, trans-2-butene, and ethylene were the key active species. Furthermore, health risk assessments revealed that no significant health risks had been caused by hexane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, <i>o</i>-xylene, and <i>m</i>-xylene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environmental Protection Shanghai Dianshan Lake Science Observatory Research Station, Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment Sciences and Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jia", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environmental Protection Shanghai Dianshan Lake Science Observatory Research Station, Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environmental Protection Shanghai Dianshan Lake Science Observatory Research Station, Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qi-Zhen", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Xiangde Environmental Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai 200235, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xue-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Environmental Protection Shanghai Dianshan Lake Science Observatory Research Station, Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qing-Yan", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628211", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201803186"]}}]}
