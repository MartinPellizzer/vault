Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) at 254, 302 and 315 nm resulted in temperature coefficients of -6.8%, +4.3% and +14.6% per 10 degrees C respectively. Scans of the spectral response curve showed a redshift with increasing temperatures in accordance with measurements of the temperature response at solar exposure. The temperature dependency during solar exposure was calculated as S(T) = (0.831 +/- 0.060) 10(-2)T + (0.694 +/- 0.004), relative to a detector kept at a constant temperature, 32 degrees C. The difference in average summer temperatures for Oslo city in the period 1951-1989 would influence uncorrected annual Robertson-Berger counts similarly as an approximate 2% change in the total amount of atmospheric ozone. The variation of the sensitivity of the Robertson-Berger meter with temperature is recommended to be corrected for by simultaneous temperature registrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnsen", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1816363", "10.1016/1011-1344(91)80033-e", "1011-1344(91)80033-E"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
