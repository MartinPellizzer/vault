The adverse effects of ozone on crop yields have the potential to significantly undermine the United Nations' ambitious target of attaining food security and ending hunger by 2030. This review examines the causes of growing tropospheric ozone, especially in India and China which lead to a substantial reduction in crop yield and forest biomass. The findings show that a nexus of high population, rapid urbanization and regional pollution sources aggravates the problem in these countries. It elucidates that when plants are exposed to ozone, specific cellular pathways are triggered, resulting in changes in the expression of genes related to hormone production, antioxidant metabolism, respiration, and photosynthesis. Assessing the risks associated with ozone exposure involves using response functions that link exposure-based and flux-based measurements to variables like crop yield. Precisely quantifying the losses in yield and economic value in food crops due to current ozone levels is of utmost importance in comprehending the risks ozone poses to global food security. We conclude that policymakers should focus on implementing measures to decrease the emissions of ozone precursors, such as enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency standards and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources. Additionally, efforts should be directed toward mapping or developing crop varieties that can tolerate ozone, applying protective measures at critical stages of plant growth and establishing ozone-related vegetation protection standards."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
