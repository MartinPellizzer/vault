Implementation of O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> with and without biofiltration was investigated at pilot-scale in terms of geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), and DBP precursor removal efficiency. Two media types (granular activated carbon and anthracite) were compared in conjunction with investigating the impact of pre-oxidation with O<sub>3</sub> (2\u202fmg/L) and varying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> mass ratios (0.1, 0.2, 0.35, and 0.5\u202fmg/mg). When O<sub>3</sub> preceded biologically active carbon (BAC) or biologically active anthracite, geosmin removals of 80% and 81%, respectively, were observed at 10\u202f\u00b0C; this increased to 89% and 90%, respectively, at 16\u202f\u00b0C. Optimal MIB removal (67%) was achieved with 0.1 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (mg/mg) in combination with BAC at 16\u202f\u00b0C. In general, geosmin proved to be more amenable to biodegradation than MIB. BAC without pre-oxidation removed 87% geosmin and 85% MIB, at 22\u202f\u00b0C. MIB removals decreased to 60% and 46%, respectively at 16\u202f\u00b0C and 10\u202f\u00b0C. The application of 0.2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> (mg/mg) prior to BAC provided treatment which effectively removed geosmin and MIB. However, in terms of DBP precursor reduction, there was no beneficial impact of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition on trihalomethane or haloacetic acid formation potentials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
