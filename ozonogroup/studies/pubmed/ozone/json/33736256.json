We hypothesized that this metabolic diversity would also enable E. uniflora to avoid oxidative damage and tolerate the enhanced ozone (O3) concentrations that have been registered in the (sub)tropics. We investigated whether carbohydrates, polyphenols and antioxidants are altered and markers of oxidative damage (ROS accumulation, alterations in leaf gas exchange, growth and biomass production) are detected in plants exposed to two levels of O<sub>3</sub> (ambient air and twice elevated ozone level in a O<sub>3</sub>-FACE system for 75\u00a0days). Phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose above a threshold of 0\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> (POD0) and accumulated exposure above 40\u00a0ppb (AOT40) were 3.6\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> and 14.898\u00a0ppb\u00a0h at ambient, and 4.7\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> and 43.881\u00a0ppb\u00a0h at elevated O<sub>3</sub>. Twenty-seven primary metabolites and 16 phenolic compounds were detected in the leaves. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis that tropical broadleaf trees are relatively O<sub>3</sub> tolerant, we concluded that E. uniflora plants are sensitive to elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Experimental POD0 values were lower than the critical levels for visible foliar O<sub>3</sub>, because of low stomatal conductance. In spite of this low stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake, we found classic O<sub>3</sub> injury, e.g. reduction in carbohydrates and fatty acids concentrations; non-significant changes in the polyphenol profile; inefficient antioxidant responses; increased contents of ROS and indicators of lipid peroxidation; reductions in stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis, root/shoot ratio and height growth. However, we also found some compensation mechanisms, e.g. increased leaf concentration of polyols for protecting the membranes, and increased leaf number for compensating the decline of photosynthetic rate. These results help filling the knowledge gap about tropical tree responses to O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
