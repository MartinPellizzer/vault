Their offspring were sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin (OVA) to establish asthma model, and the asthma features were evaluated. The splenic natural killer (NK) cells in the offspring were measured to explore the mechanism on the effects of asthma in the offspring. The responses of the pregnant mice and dams after O<sub>3</sub> exposure were evaluated.", "Airway inflammation, mucus secretion, OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E, T helper (Th) 2-skewed response, the frequency of CD3\u03b5<sup>-</sup>CD49b<sup>+</sup> splenic NK cells, the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL (interleukin)-17 were significantly exacerbated in the OVA-induced asthma offspring after prenatal O<sub>3</sub> exposure. In addition, airway inflammation, a lower number of CD3\u03b5<sup>-</sup>CD49b<sup>+</sup> splenic NK cells, and systemic oxidative stress were caused at the end of pregnancy after O<sub>3</sub> exposure, which did not recover at the end of lactation for the first two responses.", "Prenatal O<sub>3</sub> exposure increased the severity of OVA-induced asthma in the offspring, which might be directly induced by CD3\u03b5<sup>-</sup>CD49b<sup>+</sup> splenic NK cells in the offspring and indirectly related to the damaged maternal immune system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
