The following results were noted:there were certain differences in the pollutants produced by different enterprises due to different products and production links. The main pollutants in enterprise A were ammonia and VOCs. The concentration of ammonia in enterprise A ranged from 0 to 847.83 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the concentration of VOCs ranged from 4.21 to 91.68 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The main pollutants in enterprise B were VOCs, and the concentration of VOCs ranged from 3.37 to 197.30 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The ozone formation potential (OFP) ranged from 1.96 to 107.24 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Substances that required further attention in terms of ozone formation potential:enterprise A mainly included ethanol, methanol, toluene, xylene, and other substances; enterprise B mainly included 1, 1-dichloroethylene, 1, 2-dichloroethane, toluene, methylal, and other substances. The secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) ranged from 0.94 to 74.72 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The main contributors to the secondary organic aerosol formation potential were aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organics. In addition, ammonia also required additional attention. The odorous substances in pesticide enterprises were more complex, and there were differences in the exhaust pipes of different enterprises and different production links of the same enterprise. There were certain health risks in the gas pollutants of pesticide enterprises. The main carcinogens were 1, 2-dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, methyl chloride, and benzene. In addition, pyridine and hexachloroethane had certain non-carcinogenic risks in pesticide production enterprises."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Academy of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Sinodor Environmental Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Zeng-Xiu", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Academy of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Sinodor Environmental Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Xian-de", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Academy of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Sinodor Environmental Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Academy of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Sinodor Environmental Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Academy of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Sinodor Environmental Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wei-Hua", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Academy of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Tianjin 300191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control, Tianjin 300191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei-Fang", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36775597", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202202183"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
