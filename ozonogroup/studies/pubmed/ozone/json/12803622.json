Vaccinium myrtillus L., Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., and Vaccinium uliginosum L. exhibit markedly different strategies, in terms of localization and content of leaf phenolics and in their responses to UV-B enhancement. Plants were exposed to either ambient radiation or to enhancement of UV-B corresponding to 15% (clear sky) depletion of stratospheric ozone for approximately 10 years prior to commencement of this study. Vaccinium myrtillus contained the highest concentration of methanol-extractable UV-B-absorbing compounds, which was elevated in plants exposed to enhanced UV-B. Fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that these compounds were distributed throughout the leaf, and were particularly concentrated in chlorophyll-containing cells. In V. vitis-idaea, most phenolic compounds were cell wall-bound and concentrated in the walls of the epidermis; this pool increased in response to UV-B enhancement. It is suggested that these two plants represent extreme forms of two divergent strategies for UV-B screening, the different responses possibly being related to leaf longevity in the two species. The response of V. uliginosum was intermediate between the other two, with high concentrations of cell wall-bound phenolics in the epidermis but with this pool decreasing, and the methanol-soluble pool tending to increase, after exposure to enhanced UV-B. One explanation for this response is that this plant is deciduous, like V. myrtillus, but has leaves that are structurally similar to those of V. vitis-idaea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, 3.614 Stopford Building, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK, Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield, S10 2TN, UK, Institute of Biological Sciences, Edward Llwyd Building, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3DA, UK and Abisko Scientific Research Station, S 981 07 Abisko, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Semerdjieva", "ForeName": "S.
