The O<sub>3</sub> molecule is first photodissociated by the laser pulse into two fragments, O and O<sub>2</sub>. Then the same laser pulse electronically excites the O<sub>2</sub> fragment, which is vibrationally hot, whereupon fluorescence is emitted. The fluorescence intensity is found to be proportional to the concentration of ozone. Both emission and absorption characteristics have been investigated, as well as how the laser fluence affects the fluorescence signal. Quantitative ozone imaging data have been achieved based on calibration measurements in known mixtures of O<sub>3</sub>. In addition, a simultaneous study of the emission intensity captured by an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera and a spectrograph has been performed. The results show that any signal contribution not stemming from ozone is negligible compared to the strong fluorescence induced by the O<sub>2</sub> fragment, thus proving interference-free ozone imaging. The single-shot detection limit has been estimated to \u223c400\u2009ppm. The authors believe that the presented technique offers a valuable tool applicable in various research fields, such as plasma sterilization, water and soil remediation, and plasma-assisted combustion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Larsson", "ForeName": "Kajsa", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Hot", "ForeName": "Dina", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Ehn", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Current address: Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB, Finsp\u00e5ng, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Lantz", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Wubin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Ald\u00e9n", "ForeName": "Marcus", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Combustion Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Bood", "ForeName": "Joakim", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Spectrosc", "NlmUniqueID": "0372406", "ISSNLinking": "0003-7028"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28195498", "10.1177/0003702817691528"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
