This study was undertaken to provide a detailed account of the effect of chronic ozone intraperitoneal injection on the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation on brain function in rats.", "Sleep deprivation was induced using the modified multiple platform model. The rats received REM sleep deprivation with an intraperitoneal injection of ozone or midazolam for 28 days. The effects of ozone on REM sleep deprivation-induced hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits were studied by the following approaches: Morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to evaluate spatial learning and memory of rats. Morphological changes in the brain were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. RNA-sequence was performed to seek a common mechanism. The expression of the targeted gene was examined by qPCR and Western blotting.", "Ozone intraperitoneal injection reversed spatial learning and memory deficits associated with REM sleep deprivation, ameliorating pathological brain damage and down-regulating the hippocampal expression of <i>Sema3A</i> in rats after REM sleep deprivation.", "Ozone intraperitoneal injection alleviated sleep deprivation-induced spatial learning and memory deficits by protecting hippocampal neurons via down-regulation of the expression of <i>Sema3A</i> in the hippocampus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Anesthesiology, Weifang Medical University & Department of Anesthesiology, Pain & Sleep Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yi-Ning", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburg 15213, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "John P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Anesthesiology, Weifang Medical University & Department of Anesthesiology, Pain & Sleep Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain & Sleep Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Anesthesiology, Weifang Medical University & Department of Anesthesiology, Pain & Sleep Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Peking University Sixth Hospital, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Anesthesiology, Weifang Medical University & Department of Anesthesiology, Pain & Sleep Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Shandong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Savaid Medical School, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Pain & Sleep Medicine, Aviation General Hospital of China Medical University & Beijing Institute of Translational Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jian-Xiong", "Initials": "JX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Basic Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101517966", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3866"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abel T, Havekes R, Saletin JM, Walker MP.
