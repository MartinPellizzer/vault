However, accurate and quantitative kinetic data regarding virus inactivation by ozone are scarce, because of the experimental challenges associated with the high reactivity of ozone toward viruses. Here, we established an experimental batch system that allows tailoring and quantifying of very low ozone exposures and simultaneously measuring virus inactivation. Second-order ozone inactivation rate constants (k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-virus</sub>) of five enteric viruses [laboratory and two environmental strains of coxsackievirus B5 (CVF, CVEnv1, and CVEnv2), human adenovirus (HAdV), and echovirus 11 (EV)] and four bacteriophages (MS2, Q\u03b2, T4, and \u03a6174) were measured in buffered solutions. The k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-virus</sub> values of all tested viruses ranged from 4.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> to 3.3 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. For MS2, k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MS2</sub> depended only weakly on temperature (2-22 \u00b0C; E<sub>a</sub> = 22.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and pH (6.5-8.5), with an increase in k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MS2</sub> with increasing pH. The susceptibility of the selected viruses toward ozone decreases in the following order: Q\u03b2 > CVEnv2 > EV \u2248 MS2 > \u03a6174 \u2248 T4 > HAdV > CVF \u2248 CVEnv1. On the basis of the measured k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Virus</sub> and typical ozone exposures applied in water and wastewater treatment, we conclude that ozone is a highly effective disinfectant for virus control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "Camille", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Water Quality and Treatment, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) , CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0395-6561"], "LastName": "Kohn", "ForeName": "Tamar", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Inactivation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29356522", "10.1021/acs.est.7b05111"]}}]}
