MnOx supported by mesoporous alumina (MnOx/MA) was highly effective in mineralizing the PhACs in aqueous solution. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and in situ attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy were used to examine the interaction of ozone with different catalysts undervarious conditions. The crucial active sites, surface oxide species at 1380 cm(-1), were formed by the interaction of ozone with Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface. New surface hydroxyl groups at 2915 and 2845 cm(-1) were produced by the interaction of the catalyst and ozone in aqueous suspension and became active sites in the presence of MnOx. The introduction of MnOx enhanced the formation and activation of surface hydroxyl groups, causing higher catalytic reactivity. On the basis of these findings, a reaction mechanism is proposed for the catalytic ozonation of PhACs in MnOx/MA suspension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Yulun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Jiuhui", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "64J2OA7MH3", "NameOfSubstance": "manganese oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19452911", "10.1021/es803253c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
