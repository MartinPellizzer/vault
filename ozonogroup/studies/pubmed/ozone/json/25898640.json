However, the ozone source identification is very complicated due to the high non linearity between ozone and its precursors. Thus, ways to reduce ozone is still not clear. A high ozone pollution episode occurred during July, 2013, which lasted for a long period, with large influence area and high intensity. In this paper, we selected this episode to do a case study with the application of ozone source apportionment technology(OSAT) coupled within the CAMx air quality model. In this study, 4 source regions(including Shanghai, north Zhejiang, South Jiangsu and long range transport), 7 source categories (including power plants, industrial process, industrial boilers and kilns, residential, mobile source, volatile source and biogenic emissions) are analyzed to study their contributions to surface O3 in Shanghai, Suzhou and Zhejiang. Results indicate that long range transport contribution to the surface ozone in the YRD is around 20 x 10(-9) - 40 x 10(-9) (volume fraction). The O3 concentrations can increased to 40 x 10(-9) - 100 x 10(-9) (volume fraction) due to precursors emissions in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As for the regional contribution to 8 hour ozone, long range transport constitutes 42.79% +/- 10.17%, 48.57% +/- 9.97% and 60.13% +/- 7.11% of the surface ozone in Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou, respectively. Regarding the high O3 in Shanghai, local contribution is 28.94% +/- 8.49%, north Zhejiang constitutes 19.83% +/- 10.55%. As for surface O3 in Suzhou, the contribution from south Jiangsu is 26.41% +/- 6.80%. Regarding the surface O3 in Hangzhou, the major regional contributor is north Zhejiang (29.56% +/- 8.33%). Contributions from the long range transport to the daily maximum O3 concentrations are slightly lower than those to the 8-hourly O3, with the contribution of 35.35%-58.04%, while local contributions increase. As for the contributions from source sectors, it is found that the major source contributors include industrial boilers and kilns (18.4%-21.11%), industrial process (19.85%-28.46%), mobile source (21.30%-23.51%), biogenic (13.01%-17.07%) and power plants (7.08%-9.75%). Thus, industrial combustion, industrial processes, and mobile source are major anthropogenic sources of high ozone pollution in summer in the YRD region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jing-yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ru-sha", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hai-ying", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang-jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Sheng-rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Shi-kang", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Li-ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ming-hua", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25898640"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
