Nuts are an essential part of several countries' economies as an excellent source of nutrients and bioactive compounds. They are contaminated by environmental factors, improper harvesting practices, inadequate packaging procedures, improper storage, and transportation. The longer storage time also leads to the greater chances of contamination from pathogenic fungi. Nuts are infected with <i>Aspergillus</i> species, <i>Penicillium</i> species, <i>Escherichia coli, Salmonella,</i> and <i>Listeria monocytogenes.</i> Therefore, nuts are associated with a high risk of pathogens and mycotoxins, which demand the urgency of using techniques for enhancing microbial safety and shelf-life stability. Many techniques such as ozone, cold plasma, irradiation, radiofrequency have been explored for the decontamination of nuts. These techniques have different efficiencies for reducing the contamination depending on processing parameters, type of pathogen, and conditions of food material. This review provides insight into decontamination technologies for reducing microbial contamination from nuts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8039-1598"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science & Technology, Government College for Women, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Mir", "ForeName": "Shabir Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science & Technology, Government Degree College for Women, Anantnag, Jammu & Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Manzoor Ahamd", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Fruit Science, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology of Kashmir, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Mir", "ForeName": "Mohammad Maqbool", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Home Science, Government College for Women, Anantnag, Jammu & Kashmir, India."}], "LastName": "Sidiq", "ForeName": "Tahira", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science & Technology, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry, India."}], "LastName": "Sunooj", "ForeName": "Kappat Valiyapeediyekkal", "Initials": "KV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8885-3619"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science & Postharvest Technology, Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour, India."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Mohammed Wasim", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2121-0704"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fruit and Vegetable Product Technology, Prof. Wac\u0142aw D\u0105browski Institute of Agricultural and Food Biotechnology, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Food Technology and Nutrition, Institute of Food Technology and Nutrition, College of Natural Science, University of Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland."}], "LastName": "Marsza\u0142ek", "ForeName": "Krystian", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5769-0004"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mousavi Khaneghah", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35170397", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2038077"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
