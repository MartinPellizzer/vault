Because the ozone layer blocks UVC (wavelength, 180 to 280 nm) exposure, UVA (UVA I, 340 to 400 nm; UVA II, 320 to 340 nm) and UVB (280 to 320 nm) are probably the chief carcinogenic components of sunlight with relevance for human skin cancer. Substantial contributions to the elucidation of the specific signal transduction pathways involved in UV-induced skin carcinogenesis have been made over the past few years, and most evidence suggests that the cellular signaling response is UV wavelength-dependent. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are targets for UV and are important in the regulation of the multitude of UV-induced cellular responses. Experimental studies have used a range of UVA, UVB, UVC, and various combinations in multiple doses, and the observed effects on activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs are varied. This review focuses on the mechanistic data supporting a role for MAPKs in UV-induced skin carcinogenesis. Progress in understanding the mechanisms of UV-induced signal transduction could lead to the use of these protein kinases as specific targets for the prevention and control of skin cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bode", "ForeName": "Ann M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zigang", "Initials": "Z"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA27502", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA74916", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA77646", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA81064", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Sci STKE", "NlmUniqueID": "100964423", "ISSNLinking": "1525-8882"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "201"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12554854", "10.1126/stke.2003.167.re2", "2003/167/re2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
