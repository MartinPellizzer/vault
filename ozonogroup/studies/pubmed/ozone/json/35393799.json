The results showed that the total VOCs emission from industrial sources and their OFPs were 144.12 kt and 477.34 kt, respectively. Automobile manufacturing, equipment manufacturing, plastic manufacturing, and chemical raw materials and chemical products were all industries that contributed significantly to VOCs emissions and OFP, with VOCs emissions of 37.18, 33.09, 19.47, and 18.14 kt and OFP of 191.43, 153.69, 27.21, and 57.51 kt, respectively. Aromatics were the components with the largest contribution to VOCs emissions and OFP, accounting for 62.55% of the total VOCs emissions and 82.15% of the total OFP, mainly from metal surface coating and petrochemical industries. The major reactive species of industrial source VOCs were <i>m/p</i>-xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, <i>o</i>-xylene, and propylene, with OFP of 130.47, 103.37, 46.37, 42.83, and 28.26 kt, respectively, cumulatively accounting for 71.11% of the total OFP. In terms of spatial distribution, the emission intensity of VOCs and O<sub>3</sub> pollution degree in all districts and counties of Chongqing were relatively consistent; the high value points of VOCs emissions and OFP were mainly distributed in the main urban area and the western area, and the sources of VOCs emission in the main urban area and western area were mainly in metal surface coating and the petrochemical industry, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-Liang", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wei-Kai", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Chen", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ling-Tao", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation & Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Chong-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35393799", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202108015"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
