The rats were subjected to ozone inhalation at concentrations of 0, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0\u00a0ppm, respectively, for 6\u00a0h. After ozone exposure, function indicators, myocardial injury indexes and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in blood were assayed.", "High ozone exposure resulted in sustained ventricular tachycardia in male and female rats. Myocardial apoptosis in male rats started from 1.0\u00a0ppm ozone, and that in female rats started from 2.0\u00a0ppm ozone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Caspase-9 increased significantly from 0.12\u00a0ppm ozone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in both gender rats, while caspase-3 was initially activated at 0.5\u00a0ppm ozone. From 1.0\u00a0ppm ozone, mitochondrial cristae and myofilaments dissolved. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased significantly from 0.12\u00a0ppm and MRCC-IV decreased significantly from 2.0\u00a0ppm by ozone.", "Acute ozone exposure can cause paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in rats. Moreover, the changes of inflammatory factors in the heart tissues of female and male rats after ozone exposure were greater than those of oxidative stress. This study reported for the first time that 6\u00a0h ozone exposure does not cause acute cardiomyocyte necrosis, but promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mitochondrial-dependent manner. Ozone could regulate caspases-3 dependent cardiomyocyte apoptosis by affecting the balance between caspase-9 and XIAP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
