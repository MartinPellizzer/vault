A key step in the formation process is the stabilization of metastable ozone molecules through collisions with a third body, usually an inert collider such as N<sub>2</sub>. The \"ozone isotopic anomaly\" refers to the observation of larger-than-expected atmospheric concentrations for certain ozone isotopologues. Previous studies point to the formation steps as the origin of this effect. A possibly key aspect of the ozone formation dynamics is that of the relative efficiencies of the collisional cooling of different isotopologues. Although the substitution of low-abundance <sup>18</sup>O for <sup>16</sup>O in O<sub>3</sub> molecules corresponds to a relatively small net change in mass, related to this are some subtleties due to symmetry-breaking and a resulting more than doubling of the density of allowed states governed by nuclear-spin statistics for bosons. Recently, a highly accurate 3D potential energy surface (PES) describing O<sub>3</sub>-Ar interactions has been constructed and used to benchmark the low-lying rovibrational states of the complex. Here, using this new PES, we have studied the collisional energy-transfer dynamics using the MultiConfiguration Time Dependent Hartree method. A study of the rotationally inelastic scattering was performed for the parent <sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O-Ar system and compared with that of the <sup>16</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sup>18</sup>O-Ar isotopologue. The state-to-state cross-sections and rates from the 0<sub>0,0</sub> initial state to low lying excited states are reported. Analysis of these results yields insight into the interplay between small changes in the rotational constants of O<sub>3</sub> and the reduced mass of the O<sub>3</sub>-Ar collision system, combined with that of the symmetry-breaking and introduction of a new denser manifold of allowed states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9211-4862"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO 65401, USA. dawesr@mst.edu."}], "LastName": "Sur", "ForeName": "Sangeeta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7136-3827"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO 65401, USA. dawesr@mst.edu and ICTP-East African Institute for Fundamental Research, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda."}], "LastName": "Ndengu\u00e9", "ForeName": "Steve A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4378-8745"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO 65401, USA. dawesr@mst.edu."}], "LastName": "Quintas-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Ernesto", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LOMC - UMR 6294, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 du Havre, 25 rue Philippe Lebon, BP 1123, F-76063 Le Havre, France."}], "LastName": "Bop", "ForeName": "Cheikh", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0664-2536"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LOMC - UMR 6294, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 du Havre, 25 rue Philippe Lebon, BP 1123, F-76063 Le Havre, France."}], "LastName": "Lique", "ForeName": "Fran\u00e7ois", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2493-4671"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO 65401, USA. dawesr@mst.edu."}], "LastName": "Dawes", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31904066", "10.1039/c9cp06501f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
