VOCs concentrations, the ozone formation potential (OFP), the aerosol formation potential (AFP), and source apportionment using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model were studied based on chemical composition analysis. The results showed that the averaged concentration of VOCs in Zhengzhou during spring was (30.66\u00b113.60)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, of which the proportion of alkanes was the highest (35.3%) followed by oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs, 25.3%), halocarbons (24.1%), aromatics (10.0%), and alkenes (5.2%). The total OFP was 195.53 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and the contributions of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, halocarbons, and OVOCs were 25.6%, 17.8%, 38.9%, 5.8%, and 11.9%, respectively. The total AFP was 0.95 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> with an 87.6% contribution from aromatics and 12.4% from alkanes. The correlation between major species showed that pentane, isopentane, benzene, and toluene in Qinlinglu (QLL) site and Jingkaiqu (JKQ) site were greatly influenced by motor vehicles, but these were mainly influenced by combustion sources in Zhengzhou University (ZZU) site. The five factors that were identified by the PMF model were vehicle and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) volatilization source (30.5%), solvent coating source (27.3%), industrial process source (22.1%), aging air mass (14.4%), and biogenic source (5.7%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi-Xiang", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Protection Monitoring Center Station of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Ming-Hao", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Monitoring Center Station of Pingdingshan, Pingdingshan 467000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yi-Dan", "Initials": "YD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854804", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201902075"]}}]}
