The E-peroxone process involves sparging O2 and O3 gas mixture into an electrolysis reactor where a carbon-based cathode is used to electrochemically convert the sparged O2 to H2O2. The electro-generated H2O2 then reacts with sparged O3 to produce OH, which can rapidly oxidize pollutants in the bulk solution. When boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes were used as the anode, perchlorate concentrations increased significantly from undetectable levels to \u223c15-174 mg L(-1) in the different water samples as the applied current density was increased from 4 to 32 mA cm(-2). In contrast, no ClO4(-) was detected when Pt/Ti anodes were used in the E-peroxone process operated under similar reaction conditions. In addition, when sufficient O3 was sparged to maximize OH production from its peroxone reaction with electro-generated H2O2, the E-peroxone process with Pt/Ti anodes achieved comparable clofibric acid degradation and total organic carbon (TOC) removal yields as that with BDD anodes, but did not generate detectable ClO4(-). These results indicate that by optimizing operational parameters and using Pt/Ti anodes, the E-peroxone process can achieve the goal of both fast pollutant degradation and ClO4(-) prevention during the treatment of chloride-containing wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
