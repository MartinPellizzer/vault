Previously, no reviews focused solely on ambulance dispatch data. These data sets have excellent potential for environmental health research. For this review, publications up to April 2019 were identified using three main search categories covering: ambulance services including dispatches; air pollutants; and health outcomes. From 308 studies initially identified, 275 were excluded as they did not relate to ambulance service dispatches, did not report the air pollutant association, and/or did not study ambient air pollution. The main health outcomes in the remaining 33 studies were cardiac arrest (n\u202f=\u202f14), cardiovascular (n\u202f=\u202f11) and respiratory (n\u202f=\u202f10) dispatches. Meta-analyses were performed to summarise pooled relative risk (RR) of pollutants: particulate matter less than 2.5 and 10\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>), the fraction between PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (coarse) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) per 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase, carbon monoxide (CO) per 1\u202fppm increase and of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) per 10\u202fppb increment and ambulance dispatches. Statistically significant associations were found for ambulance dispatch data for all-respiratory and PM<sub>2.5</sub> at 1.03 (95% CI:1.02-1.04) and at 1.10 (95% CI:1.00-1.21) for asthma and NO<sub>2</sub> associations. For dispatches with subsequent paramedic assessment for cardiac arrest with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, CO and coarse dispatches at 1.05 (95% CI:1.03-1.08), 1.10 (95% CI:1.02-1.18) and 1.04 (95% CI:1.01-1.06) respectively. For dispatches with subsequent physician diagnosis for all-respiratory and PM<sub>2.5</sub> at 1.02 (95% CI:1.01-1.03). In conclusion, air pollution was significantly associated with an increase in ambulance dispatch data, including those for cardiac arrest, all-respiratory, and asthma dispatches. Ambulance services should plan accordingly during pollution events. Furthermore, efforts to improve air quality should lead to decreases in ambulance dispatches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
