Mast cells play an important role in asthma, and oxidant exposure has been reported to cause direct mast cell degranulation as well as augment immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated responses in vivo. H2O2 is an oxidant generated by inflammatory cells and by the interaction of ozone with lipids or aqueous solutions. In this study, the RBL-2H3 mast cell line was used to investigate the ability of H2O2 to induce mast cell responses as well as to effect mast cell responses to IgE and the calcium ionophore A23187. Although cytotoxicity of RBL-2H3 cells at the membrane level was not observed with any concentration of H2O2, DNA damage resulted from exposure to 0.2 and 2.0 mM H2O2, and cell proliferation was inhibited by 0.075-0.2 mM H2O2. RBL cell prostaglandin D2 generation was enhanced after 60- and 120-min exposure to 0.2-20 mM H2O2. Direct serotonin release required 120-min exposures to 2.0 mM and 60-min exposures to 20 mM H2O2. However, degranulation responses induced by either IgE or A23178 were diminished after exposure to 0.2-2.0 mM H2O2. Lesser amounts (0.005-0.02 mM) had no effect on mast cell function. In summary, H2O2-induced responses of RBL cells, as well as modification of responses to IgE and A23187, occurred only at high concentrations of H2O2, which also induced both intracellular damage and inhibition of cell proliferation. Concentrations of H2O2 more likely to be physiologically relevant had no effect on mast cell responses or cytotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peden", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dailey", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeGraff", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaliner", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hohman", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370511", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37H9VM9WZL", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcimycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RXY07S6CZ2", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin D2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcimycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Degranulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony-Forming Units Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin D2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8048546", "10.1152/ajplung.1994.267.1.L85"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
