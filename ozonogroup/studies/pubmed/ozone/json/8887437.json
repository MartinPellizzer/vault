The model idealized the respiratory system as a single equivalent tube with cross-sectional and surface areas that varied as a function of longitudinal position. Longitudinal gas transport in the lumen of the equivalent tube occurred by the joint action of bulk flow and a dispersion coefficient, D. Lateral absorption between respired gas and the tube wall was characterized by an overall mass transfer coefficient, K. By inputting published values of anatomic dimensions scaled to a 160-ml conducting airway volume, D values previously reported for inert insoluble gases, and K values equal to gas-phase transfer coefficients determined in physical lung models, a reasonable simulation of the lambda-V(P) distribution measured at a 250 ml/sec respiratory flow was obtained. Simulations of the corresponding V(B)-V(P) and sigma2-V(P) distributions both exhibited the correct shapes but underestimated the actual values. Although the addition of an estimated tissue resistance to K resulted in a poorer simulation of the data, an increase in conducting airway volume from a value of 160 ml estimated by the subjects' CO2 dead space to a value of 200 ml substantially improved the V(B)-V(P) and sigma2-V(P) simulations without sacrificing the quality of the lambda-V(P) simulation. We conclude that the inclusion of a tissue diffusion resistance is not necessary to properly simulate bolus inhalation data during quiet breathing, but a reliable measurement of conducting airway volume is crucial."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bush", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raybold", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abeles", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-Jebria", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES06075", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8887437", "10.1006/taap.1996.0216", "S0041-008X(96)90216-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
