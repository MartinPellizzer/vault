The answers were developed by a large group of scientists engaged in the WHO project \u201cReview of evidence on health aspects of air pollution \u2013 REVIHAAP\u201d. The experts reviewed and discussed the newly accumulated scientific evidence on the adverse effects on health of air pollution, formulating science-based answers to the 24 questions. Extensive rationales for the answers, including the list of key references, are provided. The review concludes that a considerable amount of new scientific information on the adverse effects on health of particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide, observed at levels commonly present in Europe, has been published in recent years. This new evidence supports the scientific conclusions of the <i>WHO air quality guidelines</i>, last updated in 2005, and indicates that the effects in some cases occur at air pollution concentrations lower than those serving to establish these guidelines. It also provides scientific arguments for taking decisive actions to improve air quality and reduce the burden of disease associated with air pollution in Europe. This publication arises from the project REVIHAAP and has been co-funded by the European Union."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 World Health Organization 2013."}, "Sections": [{"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Acknowledgements"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Abbreviations"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Introduction"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "A", "SectionTitle": "Health effects of PM"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "B", "SectionTitle": "Health effects of ozone"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "C", "SectionTitle": "Proximity to roads, NO<sub>2</sub>, other air pollutants and their mixtures"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "D", "SectionTitle": "General questions"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "References"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "List of invited experts participating in REVIHAAP"}]}, "PubmedBookData": {"History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27195369"]}}]}
