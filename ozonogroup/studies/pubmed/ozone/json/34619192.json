Understanding the impact of changes in anthropogenic emissions on O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> trends is helpful for developing air quality management strategies. Herein, we investigated the variations of air pollutants in summer over Beijing using long-term data sets from 2014 to 2019, and explored the responses of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> trends to changes in anthropogenic emissions based on multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis and WRF-Chem model. The results indicated a significant decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, but a near constant level of O<sub>3</sub> during 2014-2019. The decrease rate of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which was lower than that of SO<sub>2</sub>, might be due to the effect of NO<sub>2</sub> on atmospheric PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Both the slightly increasing correlations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> and the WRF-Chem model simulations implied that atmospheric PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing is trending to be more sensitive to NO<sub>x</sub> than SO<sub>2</sub>. The emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs from industry and transportation were found to make great contribution to O<sub>3</sub> production in Beijing. Due to the titration of NO<sub>x</sub> in VOC-limited regime, the relatively low emission ratios of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs from industry and transportation in Beijing provided convincing evidence for the persistently high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during 2014-2019. However, the noticeable increase of the O<sub>3</sub> trends in other areas (e.g., Hebei, Tianjin) could be explained by the significant decline in the emission ratios of NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs from anthropogenic emissions especially industry during 2014-2019. Controlling the emission of NO<sub>x</sub> can substantially reduce PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution, but may aggravate O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and thus effective VOC emission control strategies need to be considered for simultaneously controlling O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in Beijing and other regions of China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
