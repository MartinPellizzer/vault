Pulmonary bactericidal activity by alveolar macrophages was significantly enhanced in the lungs of mice exposed to the mixture relative to those inhaling filtered air or O3 alone. The total number and distribution of the free cells lavaged from the lungs, as well as cellular ATP levels, did not change due to the pollutant exposures. In vitro cytostasis in tumor target cells cocultured with peritoneal macrophages from the exposed mice was significantly enhanced in the O3-exposed and in the mixture-exposed treatment groups relative to controls and also in the mixture-exposed relative to the O3-exposed group when a target-to-effector-cell ratio of 1:10 was used; no such effects were observed when this ratio was 1:20. Splenic T-lymphocyte function, as measured by blastogenesis to mitogens and alloantigens, was affected by exposure to O3 and/or the mixture, although the patterns of effects were qualitatively different. Splenic B-cell function and macrophage antigen processing, as measured by the generation of antibody plaque-forming cells, was unaffected by exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aranyi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vana", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "P T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bradof", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fenters", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SU46BAM238", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Sulfate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Cellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella pneumoniae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcal Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6355495", "10.1080/15287398309530407"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
