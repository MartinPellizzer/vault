The recombination rate coefficient has a strong temperature dependence, which approximately can be described by T(-n) with n approximately 3. It is negligible for temperatures above 700 K or so, but it becomes important for low temperatures. The calculations unambiguously affirm the conclusions of Hippler et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 6560 (1990)] and Luther et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 7, 2764 (2005)] that the chaperon mechanism makes a sizable contribution to the recombination of O3 at room temperature and below. The dependence of the chaperon recombination rate coefficient on the isotopomer, studied for two different isotope combinations, is only in rough qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The oxygen atom isotope exchange reaction involving ArO and ArO2 van der Waals complexes is also investigated; the weak binding of O or O2 to Ar has only a small effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Dynamik und Selbstorganisation, D-37073 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. mivanov@gwdg.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "Mikhail V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schinke", "ForeName": "Reinhard", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16542075", "10.1063/1.2174013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
