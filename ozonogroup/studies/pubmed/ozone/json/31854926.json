The water quality, dissolved organic matter (DOM) characteristics, microbial activity, and DBPs formation at different O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were analyzed. Results showed that the effect of O<sub>3</sub> on microorganisms is mainly that it increased the utilization efficiency of DOM. However, excessive O<sub>3</sub> increased the amount of organic matter such as protein and microbial metabolites (SMPs) in the effluent. When the O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased from 0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> to 2.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, the survival rate of microorganisms in the BAC decreased from 95.10% to 62.60%. However, since O<sub>3</sub> transforms organic matter into a biodegradable substance, we found that microbial activity increased by 62.52% and that the biofiltration of the BAC was enhanced. When the O<sub>3</sub> concentration was further increased to 4.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, the microbial survival rate decreased to 49.9% and the protein and SMPs produced by the microorganisms increased. This resulted in an increased formation of carbon-containing DBPs (C-DBPs) and nitrogen-containing DBPs (N-DBPs) by 41.93% and 7.18%, respectively. In summary, an appropriate dosage of O<sub>3</sub> was beneficial for removing DOM by O<sub>3</sub>-BAC, but we found that an excessive O<sub>3</sub> concentration caused the formation of new DBPs precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bao-Ming", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xi-Xi", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xia", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Yan-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Anaerobic Biotechnology, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Engineering Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Carbon Reduction Technology, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Wen-Quan", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Engineering Laboratory of Biomass Energy and Carbon Reduction Technology, Wuxi 214122, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Technology and Material of Water Treatment, Suzhou 215009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Heng-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Technology and Material of Water Treatment, Suzhou 215009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Quality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854926", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201907102"]}}]}
