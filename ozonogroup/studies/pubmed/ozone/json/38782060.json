Herein, an ozonated oleogel (OG<sub>(O)</sub>) was developed to achieve cancer ozone therapy (O<sub>3</sub>-T) based on intracellular Criegee's reaction. By integrating the chemo-drug, the ozone-loaded oleogel (Dox@OG<sub>(O)</sub>) was prepared as a chemotherapeutic agent for local O<sub>3</sub>-T, associated with chemotherapy (CT)/radiotherapy (RT)/immunotherapy and wound healing. The in vitro results showed that, Dox@OG<sub>(O)</sub> could achieve high ozone loading efficiency and ensure its stability. This Oleogel-mediated O<sub>3</sub>-T could directly destroy tumor cells via intracellular Criegee's reaction occurred on cell membranes, as well as the effects of tumor microenvironment (TME) regulation by the generation of oxygen/reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of glutathione (GSH). Meanwhile, under the stimulation of X-ray, an accelerated free radical's production was observed, further combined with the radio-sensitivity after TME regulation, an effective anti-tumor effect would be achieved. Further on, in vivo results demonstrated that the locally implanted Dox@OG<sub>(O)</sub> could effectively inhibit the growth of both primary and secondary tumors. Considering these results above, it will serve as inspiration for future studies investigating of O<sub>3</sub>-T, especially for postoperative skin diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
