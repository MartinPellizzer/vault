Blood samples were collected for the detection of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Histologic examinations were evaluated and immunohistochemistry was also performed for localization of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB. The expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 were studied by Real-time PCR. Western blot was performed to detect the expression of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB.", "The results indicated that blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels increased significantly in I/R group. Rats treated with OzoneOP showed obviously less renal damage. Immunohistochemistry showed that TLR4 were ameliorated by OzoneOP. Realtime PCR showed that OzoneOP could significantly inhibit the increased mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 induced by I/R. Western blot indicated that the expression of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB were upregulated in I/R group, but OzoneOP could inhibit this increase.", "These findings indicated that OzoneOP had potent anti-inflammatory properties by the modulation of the TLR4-NF-\u03baB pathway in renal ischemia/reperfusion injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Bianzhi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Xiaodong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhiyuan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Hubei, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiuheng", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Acta Cir Bras", "NlmUniqueID": "9103983", "ISSNLinking": "0102-8650"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tlr4 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemic Preconditioning"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25627272", "10.1590/S0102-86502015001000008", "S0102-86502015000100060"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
