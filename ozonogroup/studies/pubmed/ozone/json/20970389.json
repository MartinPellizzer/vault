In this article, we highlight recent advances using DNPH provided by our studies over past seven years. DNPH reacts with carbonyls to form corresponding stable 2,4-DNPhydrazone derivatives (DNPhydrazones). This method may result in analytical error because DNPhydrazones have both E- and Z-stereoisomers caused by the CN double bond. Purified aldehyde-2,4-DNPhydrazone demonstrated only the E-isomer, but under UV irradiation and the addition of acid, both E- and Z-isomers were seen. In order to resolve the isometric problem, a method for transforming the CN double bond of carbonyl-2,4-DNPhydrazone into a C-N single bond, by reductive amination using 2-picoline borane, has been developed. The amination reactions of C1-C10 aldehyde DNPhydrazones are completely converted into the reduced forms and can be analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography. As a new application using DNPH derivatization, the simultaneous measurement of carbonyls with carboxylic acids or ozone is described in this review."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.
