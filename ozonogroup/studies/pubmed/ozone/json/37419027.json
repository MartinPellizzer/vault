This study evaluated the inactivation of amoeba spores and their intraspore bacteria by solar/chlorine. Dictyostelium discoideum and Burkholderia agricolaris B1qs70 were selected as model amoebae and intraspore bacteria, respectively. Compared to solar irradiation and chlorine, solar/chlorine enhanced the inactivation of amoeba spores and intraspore bacteria, with 5.1 and 5.2-log reduction at 20\u00a0min, respectively. The enhancement was similar in real drinking water by solar/chlorine under natural sunlight. However, the spore inactivation decreased to 2.97-log by 20\u00a0min solar/chlorine under oxygen-free condition, indicating that ozone played a crucial role in the spore inactivation, as also confirmed by the scavenging test using tert\u2011butanol to scavenge the ground-state atomic oxygen (O(<sup>3</sup>P)) as a ozone precursor. Moreover, solar/chlorine induced the shape destruction and structural collapse of amoeba spores by scanning electron microscopy. As for intraspore bacteria, their inactivation was likely ascribed to endogenous reactive oxygen species. As pH increased from 5.0 to 9.0, the inactivation of amoeba spores decreased, whereas that of intraspore bacteria was similar at pH 5.0 and 6.5 during solar/chlorine treatment. This study first reports the efficient inactivation of amoeba spores and their intraspore pathogenic bacteria by solar/chlorine in drinking water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
