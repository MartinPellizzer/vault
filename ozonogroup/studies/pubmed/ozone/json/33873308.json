The relationship of PR-10 proteins, particularly PR-10c, to oxidative stress caused by metals or ozone was studied in tolerant and sensitive birch clones to find out possible linkages to tolerance. \u2022\u2002 Antibody developed to PR-10c was used in Western blot analysis. Other PR-10 proteins were studied with two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Metal-sensitive yeasts were transformed with PR-10c. \u2022\u2002 Two new members of PR-10 family, PR-10d and PR-10e, were found. Various PR-10 proteins showed different expression patterns. The amount of PR-10c increased with increasing soil metal concentrations but was, in general, more prominent in Cu-sensitive than in Cu-tolerant clones. PR-10c did not alter metal tolerance in metal-sensitive yeasts. \u2022\u2002 The PR-10c protein appears not to confer metal- or ozone-tolerance in birch. However, this does not exclude the possibility that it is involved in the tolerance or sensitivity mechanism in an indirect manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koistinen", "ForeName": "Kaisa M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassinen", "ForeName": "Viivi H", "Initials": "VH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gynther", "ForeName": "Petra A M", "Initials": "PAM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lehesranta", "ForeName": "Satu J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kein\u00e4nen", "ForeName": "Sirpa I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kokko", "ForeName": "Harri I", "Initials": "HI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "Elina J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tervahauta", "ForeName": "Arja I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Auriola", "ForeName": "Seppo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00e4renlampi", "ForeName": "Sirpa O", "Initials": "SO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Baker CJ, Orlandi EW. 1995.
