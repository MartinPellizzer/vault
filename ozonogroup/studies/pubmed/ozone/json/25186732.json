The weight, height, and BP were measured. Four-year average concentrations of particles with an aerodynamic diameter of \u226410 \u03bcm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) were calculated from monitoring stations. Two-level regression analysis was used to examine the effects, controlling for covariates.", "The results showed that associations existed between hypertension and pollutants. The odds ratios for hypertension ranged from 1.12 per 46.3 \u03bcg/m3 increase for O3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.13) to 1.68 per 30.6 \u03bcg/m3 increase for PM10 (95% CI, 1.53-1.86). The increases in mean diastolic BP ranged from 0.58 mm Hg per 46.3 \u03bcg/m3 increase for O3 (95% CI, 0.52-0.63 mm Hg) to 2.89 mm Hg per 563.4 \u03bcg/m3 increase for CO (95% CI: 2.53-3.24 mm Hg). The increase in systolic BP ranged from 0.50 mm Hg per 46.3 \u03bcg/m3 increase for O3 (95% CI: 0.43-0.57 mm Hg) to 2.10 mm Hg per 30.6 \u03bcg/m3 increase for PM10 (95% CI, 1.73-2.47 mm Hg). Compared with children who had been breastfed, non-breastfed children exhibited consistently stronger effects.", "Study findings indicate that high levels of PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO are associated with increased arterial BP and hypertension among the children.
