Emission of gaseous I2 increased as a function of the aqueous FeCl2 concentration, and the maximum I2 formation with Fe(2+) was about 10 times more than without Fe(2+). This enhancement can be explained by the OH(-) scavenging by Fe(3+) formed from Fe(2+) ozonation to produce colloidal Fe(OH)3. This mechanism was confirmed by measurements of aqueous phase products using a UV-vis spectrometer and an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. We infer that such a pH-buffering effect may play the key role in general halogen activations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Systems Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. y_sakamoto@ees.hokudai.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Yosuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enami", "ForeName": "Shinichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tonokura", "ForeName": "Kenichi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23485095", "10.1021/jp308407j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
