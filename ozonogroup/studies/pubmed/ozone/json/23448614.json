The rate coefficient for reaction with OH radicals was measured and an upper limit for the reaction with ozone was established; kOH = (2.8 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10(-11) at 297 \u00b1 3 K (averaged value including results from Harrison and Wells) and kO(3) < 2 \u00d7 10(-19) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 299 K. The products of the OH radical initiated oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of NOX were studied. Benzaldehyde, originating from H-abstraction from the -CH(2)OH group, was identified using in situ FTIR spectroscopy, HPLC-UV/FID, and GC-PID and quantified in a yield of (24 \u00b1 5) %. Ring retaining products originating from OH-addition to the aromatic ring such as o-hydroxybenzylalcohol and o-dihydroxybenzene as well as ring-cleavage products such as glyoxal were also identified and quantified with molar yields of (22 \u00b1 2)%, (10 \u00b1 3)%, and (2.7 \u00b1 0.7)%, respectively. Formaldehyde was observed with a molar yield of (27 \u00b1 10)%. The results are discussed with respect to previous studies and the atmospheric oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Combustion, A\u00e9rothermique, R\u00e9activit\u00e9 et Environnement, CNRS, UPR 3021, Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers en R\u00e9gion Centre, 1C Avenue de la Recherche Scientifique, 45071 Orl\u00e9ans Cedex 2, France."}], "LastName": "Bernard", "ForeName": "Fran\u00e7ois", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Magneron", "ForeName": "Isabelle", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eyglunent", "ForeName": "Gr\u00e9gory", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Da\u00eble", "ForeName": "V\u00e9ronique", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wallington", "ForeName": "Timothy J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hurley", "ForeName": "Michael D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "Abdelwahid", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LKG8494WBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Alcohol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TA269SD04T", "NameOfSubstance": "benzaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Alcohol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23448614", "10.1021/es304600z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
