However, little is known about the detailed chemical mechanism of this process. We have mapped out the fate of aqueous SO(2) in the presence of ozone by use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations in solution (via the polarized continuum model, PCM), including up to two explicit water molecules. The calculations predict that the hydrolysis of SO(2).H(2)O, although possessing a barrier, is still more energetically favorable than its ozonation. The ozonation of HOSO(2)(-) and SO(3)(2)(-) proceeds without barriers and gives S(VI) products that are more stable than the reagents by 77.1 and 88.6 kcal/mol, respectively. By comparing our calculated pH dependence of the ozonation kinetics to those determined experimentally, we conclude that, despite a high calculated energy barrier to the ozonation of sulfonate (HSO(3)(-)), it is the dominant form of S(IV) in solutions of neutral pH and is the species through which ozonation occurs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 Saint George Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kahan", "ForeName": "Tara F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ardura", "ForeName": "Diego", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donaldson", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20085262", "10.1021/jp9085156"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
