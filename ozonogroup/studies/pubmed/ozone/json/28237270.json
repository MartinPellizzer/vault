In the present work, degradation of triazophos (O,O-diethyl-O-(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) phosphorothioate) as a model pollutant has been investigated using high volume continuous ultrasonic flow cell for the first time. Effect of power dissipation and initial pH on the extent of triazophos degradation using acoustic cavitation has been investigated initially. Under the optimized set of operating power dissipation and pH, effect of addition of hydrogen peroxide (ratio of C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>PS (Triazophos):H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> over the range of 1:1-1:5), ozone (over the flow rate of 100-400mg/h) and Fenton's reagent (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>PS:FeSO<sub>4</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ratio over the range of 1:1:1-1:4:4) has been investigated as possible process intensification strategy. Combined operation of US with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Ozone resulted in 48.6% and 54.6% triazophos degradation respectively whereas combination of US and Fenton's reagent resulted in maximum degradation as 92.2% and also resulted in maximum COD removal as 88.5%. The study also focused on identification of intermediate products formed during the degradation as well as establishing the kinetic rate constants and the synergistic index for different approaches. The study has established that cavitation can be effectively used for triazophos degradation with significant intensification benefits based on the use of combination approach."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
