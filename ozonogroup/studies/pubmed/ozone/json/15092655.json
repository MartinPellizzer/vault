Troposphere O(3) is predominantly produced by photochemical reactions involving precursors generated by natural processes and to a much larger extent by man's activities. There is evidence for a trend towards increasing tropospheric O(3) concentrations. However, tropospheric O(3) is known to account for only 10% of the vertical O(3) column above the earth's surface. The stratosphere accounts for an additional 90% of the O(3) column. There is evidence to suggest that there are losses in the stratospheric O(3) due to the updraft of O(3) destroying pollutants generated by both natural processes and by human activity. Such a loss in stratospheric O(3) can result in alterations of incidence in the ultraviolet (UV) radiation to the earth's surface. Tropospheric O(3) is known to be highly phytotoxic. Appropriate exposures to O(3) can result in both acute (symptomatic) and chronic (changes in growth, yield or productivity and quality) effects. Chronic effects are of great concern in terms of both crops and forests. A number of experimental techniques are available to evaluate the chronic effects of O(3) on plants. There are limitations attached to the use of these techniques. However, results obtained, with such techniques are valuable if interpreted in the appropriate context. Among all field evaluation techniques, open-top chambers are the most frequently used method for evaluating the chronic effects of O(3) on crops. The National Crop Loss Assessment Program (NCLAN) of the United States is the largest such effort. However, given the limitations of the open-top chambers and the experimental aspects of NCLAN, its results must be interpreted with caution. On the other hand, acute effects can be evaluated with less complexity through the use of biological indicator plants. The numerical modelling of such effects are also far less complicated than establishing numerical cause and effects relationships for chronic effects. Confounding the acute or chronic responses of plants to O(3), is the presence of other kinds and forms of pollutants in the ambient atmosphere and the incidence of pathogens and pests. The resulting complex interactions and joint effects on plants are poorly understood. Future research must address these issues. In the final analysis we have re-emphasized the fact that plant health is the product of its interaction with the physical and chemical climatology and pathogens and pests. What we have described in this context is the importance of tropospheric O(3) within the chemical climatology of our environment and its effects on vegetation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krupa", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manning", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092655", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90187-x", "0269-7491(88)90187-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
