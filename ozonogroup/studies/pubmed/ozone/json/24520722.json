In order to remove volatiles from biogas slurry efficiently, the dynamic headspace and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to clear the composition of volatiles. Nitrogen stripping and superfluous ozone were also used to remove volatiles from biogas slurry. The results showed that there were 21 kinds of volatile compounds in the biogas slurry, including sulfur compounds, organic amines, benzene, halogen generation of hydrocarbons and alkanes, some of which had strong peculiar smell. The volatile compounds in biogas slurry can be removed with the rate of 53.0% by nitrogen stripping and with rate of 81.7% by the oxidization and stripping of the superfluous ozone. On this basis, the removal rate of the volatile compounds reached 99.2% by chloroform and n-hexane extraction, and almost all of odor was eliminated. The contents of some dissolved organic compounds decreased obviously and however main plant nutrients had no significant change in the biogas slurry after being treated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China. jlndwangyujun@163.com"}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yujun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Lianshuang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Development College, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130600, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiaosong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiulan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jingmin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huiqing", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Sen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Miping", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Resources, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Zhonglei", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24520722", "10.1016/s1001-0742(12)60240-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
