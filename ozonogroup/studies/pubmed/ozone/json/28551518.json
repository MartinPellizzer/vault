They were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption techniques, and the results showed that Ce/MCM-48 still retained a highly ordered cubic structure. A series of experiments were conducted to study the catalytic activity of Ce/MCM-48 and Ce/MCM-41 for ozonation of clofibric acid in aqueous solution. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) removal efficiency in Ce/MCM-48/O<sub>3</sub> can be improved to 64% at 120min reaction time, 54% by Ce/MCM-41/O<sub>3</sub>, only 24% by MCM-48/O<sub>3</sub>, 23% by single ozonation. Ce/MCM-48 did not show any adsorption capacity for CA. Effect of initial pH revealed that active sites were surface protonated hydroxyl groups. The restraint of phosphate and sodium hydrogen sulfite (NaHSO<sub>3</sub>) on the mineralization of CA illustrated more hydroxyl radicals were generated by Ce/MCM-48 catalysts than Ce/MCM-41. The degradation pathway of CA was investigated by the alterations of pH under different conditions. Recycle tests of catalysts demonstrated that compared with Ce/MCM-41, Ce/MCM-48 exhibited more excellent catalytic efficiency and stability because of its unique pore systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
