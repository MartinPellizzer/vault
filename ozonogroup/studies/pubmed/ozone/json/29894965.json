Over the past several years, the E-peroxone process has quickly emerged as a promising EAOP for the abatement of emerging contaminants (ECs) in water. Because of the enhanced ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) transformation to hydroxyl radicals (OH) by electro-generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the E-peroxone process can considerably increase the efficiency and decrease the energy demand for the abatement of ozone-resistant ECs compared with conventional ozonation. Meanwhile, the E-peroxone process can substantially mitigate the formation of bromate during the treatment of bromide-containing water, which has been a major concern of conventional ozonation for water treatment. Hence, by simply installing electrodes in ozone contactors, the E-peroxone process can remarkably enhance the performance of water and wastewater treatment in various aspects. Compared with other ozone-based AOPs such as the conventional peroxone (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and UV/O<sub>3</sub> processes, the E-peroxone process also represents a more convenient, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and safer option for EC abatements. This paper reviews recent research of the E-peroxone process, with focus on the abatement of ECs in real water matrices. The fundamental reaction mechanisms that are essential to the understanding, design, and operation of the E-peroxone process are described. The abatement of various ECs in natural water and wastewater by the E-peroxone process are critically reviewed. The challenges in scaling-up the E-peroxone process and integrating it in water and wastewater treatment trains for practical applications are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
