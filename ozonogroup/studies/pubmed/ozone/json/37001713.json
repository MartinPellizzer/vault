Specimens were de-crowned till the cementoenamel junction preserving 12\u00a0mm of root length and were mounted vertically. Canal therapy was performed using a crown-down approach. Obturation was performed followed by post-space preparation. Samples were allocated into 4 groups based on chemical irrigations and photosensitizers used(n\u00a0=\u00a015). Group 1 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a017% EDTA), group 2 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a0FTC), group 3 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a0Chitosan), group 4 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a0OW). The ultra microhardness tester was put under a load of 5\u00a0mN at a speed of 1.5\u00a0mN/s for 1\u00a0s to assess the MH. The fiber post was luted with dual-cure cement and slices of 1\u00a0mm were prepared from each third of the tooth. PBS and failure mode analysis were performed using a universal testing machine (UTM) and stereomicroscope respectively. ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparisons t-tests for assessment of PBS and MH p\u00a0>\u00a00.05 RESULTS: Group 1 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a017% EDTA) exhibited the highest MH (0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0GPa). Whereas, group 2 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a0FTC) displayed the lowest MH (0.011\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0GPa). The highest PBS was exhibited by the coronal third of group 1 (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a017% EDTA) (7.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.81\u00a0MPa). The apical section of group 3 specimens (5.25% NaOCl\u00a0+\u00a0Chitosan) (2.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26\u00a0MPa) unveiled the lowest PBS. Intergroup comparison analysis revealed that group 2 and group 3 displayed comparable outcomes of PBS. Group 1 and Group 4 also demonstrated no significant difference in the bond scores in all three sections.", "OW as a final irrigant can be used as an alternative to EDTA as it improves the bond strength with minimum impact on marten hardness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
