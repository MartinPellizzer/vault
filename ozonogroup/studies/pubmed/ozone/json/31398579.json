In our research, solar/chlorine process was comprehensively investigated to degrade and detoxify MC-LR. Under the chlorine concentration of 1.0\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>, MC-LR (1.0\u202f\u03bcM) was decreased by 96.7%, 26%, and 9% by solar/chlorine process, chlorination, and solar irradiation respectively. Quenching experiments confirmed that reactive chlorine species (RCS) and hydroxyl radical (HO) were the predominant reactive species in solar/chlorine process at neutral condition, and ozone was generated because of the participation of triplet-state oxygen (O(<sup>3</sup>P)). The respective contributions of each reactive species were calculated with the order as: RCS, HO, ozone, and solar irradiation. The presence of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and natural organic matter in water inhibited the degradation efficiency of MC-LR. Moreover, the transformation products of MC-LR generated during the solar/chlorine process were identified and a possible pathway was proposed. The hepatotoxicity of MC-LR and its transformation products was compared using protein phosphatase 2A. Our experimental results revealed that the concentration and hepatotoxicity of MC-LR both significantly decreased, and most products were not hepatoxic. Overall, the solar/chlorine process is a promising alternative technology to degrade MC-LR during eutrophication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
