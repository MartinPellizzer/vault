Currently, FSC is limited to 0.1% (w/w) within and 0.5% (w/w) outside SECAs, with exceptions for ships employing wet sulphur scrubbers. These scrubbers enable vessels using non-compliant fuels such as high-sulphur heavy fuel oils (HFOs) to enter SECAs. However, while sulphur reduction via scrubbers is effective, their efficiency in capturing other potentially harmful gases remains uncertain. Moreover, emerging compliant fuels like highly aromatic fuels or low-sulphur blends lack characterisation and may pose risks. Over three years, we assessed emissions from an experimental marine engine at 25% and 75% load, representative of manoeuvring and cruising, respectively. First, characterizing emissions from five different compliant and non-compliant fuels (marine gas oil MGO, hydro-treated vegetable oil HVO, high-, low- and ultra-low sulphur HFOs), we calculated emission factors (EF). Then, the wet scrubber gas-phase capture efficiency was measured using compliant and non-compliant HFOs. NO<sub>x</sub> EF varied among fuels (5200-19700 mg/kWh), with limited scrubber reduction. CO (EF 750-13700 mg/kWh) and hydrocarbons (HC; EF 122-1851 mg/kWh) showed also insufficient abatement. Carcinogenic benzene was notably higher at 25% load and about an order of magnitude higher with HFOs compared to MGO and HVO, with no observed scrubber reduction. In contrast, carbonyls such as carcinogenic formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, acting as ozone precursors, were effectively scrubbed due to their polarity and water solubility. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of all fuels was examined. Significant EF differences between fuels and engine loads were observed, with the wet scrubber providing limited or no reduction of gaseous emissions. We suggest enhanced regulations and emission abatements in the marine sector to mitigate gaseous pollutants harmful to human health and the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
