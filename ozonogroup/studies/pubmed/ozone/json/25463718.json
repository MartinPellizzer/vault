The mean O(3) concentration (11:00-16:00) during the exposure period had a range from 16 ppb in the FA treatment to 118 ppb in the NF + O(3) treatment. Net photosynthetic rate and leaf area per plant were significantly reduced by exposure to O(3), reducing the growth of both varieties. Exposure to O(3) significantly reduced the 100-seed weight and number of seeds per pod. As a result, cowpea yield was significantly reduced by long-term exposure to O(3), with no difference in sensitivity between the varieties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tetteh", "ForeName": "Rashied", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "Masahiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wada", "ForeName": "Yoshiharu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Funada", "ForeName": "Ryo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Izuta", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25463718", "10.1016/j.envpol.2014.10.008", "S0269-7491(14)00424-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
