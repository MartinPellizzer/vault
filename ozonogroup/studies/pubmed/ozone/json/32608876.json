Each production procedure in the automobile manufacturing and petrochemical industries was considered. The results showed that each automobile manufacturing procedure had its own dominant species, and alkanes (32%) and aromatics (35%) were the main emission species of coating spraying. The emission characteristics of furniture manufacturing were highly correlated with the raw materials, and the VOC emission species were mainly composed of aromatics (50%) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) (38%). As for the petrochemical industry, VOC concentrations in various process plant areas ranged from 49 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> to 1387 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. As the main products of the refining area were C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>9</sub> gasoline and benzene series, whereas comparatively more solvents were used in the chemical area, which would generate alkene products, VOC concentrations greatly differed in the various process plant areas. In terms of electronic manufacturing, OVOCs were the main emission species, accounting for more than 50% of total VOCs. Alkanes and OVOCs were the main contributors to VOC emissions in shoemaking, accounting for 52% and 36% on average, respectively, which was strongly related to the species of the used solvents. The VOC emission species of automobile manufacturing were quite different, predominantly including n-dodecane and 2-butanone. The emission species of furniture manufacturing mainly included styrene, ethyl acetate, <i>m</i>/<i>p</i>-xylene, etc., which are typical species of coatings and diluents. As for the differences in the emission species of process plant areas in the petrochemical industry, styrene was the main species in the refining area, 1,3-butadiene in the chemical area, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> alkanes in the storage area, and C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>8</sub> alkanes in the wastewater treatment area. The main emission species of electronic manufacturing were ethanol, acetone, and other aldehyde ketone species. The emission species of shoemaking enterprises are mainly C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>6</sub> alkanes. According to the results of ozone formation potential (OFP), alkenes and aromatics were the main VOC emission species that contribute significantly to the OFP in the automobile manufacturing and petrochemical industries, with relatively high pollution source reaction activity. The results showed that the emission ratio (17%-96%) and OFP contributions of OVOCs were significant in various industries. Therefore, for VOC emission control, in addition to focusing on the control of aromatics and alkenes, attention should also be paid to OVOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zi-Hang", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ke-Ying", "Initials": "KY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Qin-Wen", "Initials": "QW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Tonsin Testing Corporation, Chengdu 610046, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Dai-Juan", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Dan-Lin", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qiu-Yu", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Wen-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608876", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
