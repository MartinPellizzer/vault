CTMA and other QACs are only partially eliminated in municipal wastewater treatment and they can interact with bacteria in biological processes. Currently, there is only limited information on the antimicrobial efficiency of CTMA in matrices other than standard growth media and if and how CTMA influences conventional chemical disinfection. The results obtained in this study showed that the susceptibility of E. coli to CTMA was significantly enhanced in phosphate-buffered saline, lake water and wastewater compared to broth. In broth, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CTMA of 20\u00a0mgL<sup>-1</sup> was observed for E. coli, whereas a 4-log inactivation occurred for CTMA concentrations of about 4\u00a0mgL<sup>-1</sup> in buffered ultra-purified water, a lake water and wastewater effluent. The impacts of the pre-exposure and the presence of CTMA on inactivation by ozone and monochloramine were tested with three different E. coli strains: AG100 with the efflux pump acrAB intact, AG100A with it deleted and AG100tet with it overexpressed. Pre-exposure of E. coli AG100 to CTMA led to an increased susceptibility for ozone with second-order inactivation rate constants (\u223c 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) increasing by a factor of about 1.5. An opposite trend was observed for monochloramine with second-order inactivation rate constants (\u223c 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) decreasing by a factor of about 2. For E. coli AG100tet, the second-order inactivation rate constant decreased by a factor of almost 2 and increased by a factor of about 1.5 for ozone and monochloramine, respectively, relative to the strain AG100. The simultaneous presence of CTMA and ozone enhanced the second-order inactivation rate constants for CTMA concentrations of 2.5\u00a0mgL<sup>-1</sup> by a factor of about 3. For monochloramine also an enhancement of the inactivation was observed, which was at least additive but might also be synergistic. Enhancement by factors from about 2 to 4.5 were observed for CTMA concentrations > 2.5\u00a0mgL<sup>-1</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
