In the semi-batch mode experiments, secondary effluent and primary effluen of sewage treatment plants were ozonated respectively. Behaviour of brominated by-products was also evaluated. The results based on these studies indicated that estrogenicity in wastewater can be removed by ozonation effectively. The condition of ozonation until dissolved ozone concentration increased to 0.1 mg/L, which corresponded to 1 mgO3/mgC and 0.4 mgO3/mgC of ozone consumption per initial DOC for secondary effluent and primary effluent, respectively, is proposed as an appropriate operational condition for efficient removal of EDCs as well as UV254 and SUVA without production of brominated by-products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban & Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Yoshida-honmachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. zhanghq@water.env.kyoto-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Heqing", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Harumi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sung-Eun", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyo-Sang", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuno", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17165455", "10.2166/wst.2006.881"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
