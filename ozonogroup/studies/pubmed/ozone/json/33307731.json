In the current research, constructed wetlands (CWs) vegetated with <i>Typha angustifolia</i> plant in combination with catalytic ozonation by ferrous (Fe)-coated zeolite A was studied for the treatment of leachate. The CWs treatment with 9\u2009days detention reduced the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) up to 75.81% and 69.84%, respectively. Moreover, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) removal of 91.16%, 33.33%, and 25.22% were achieved, respectively. The Fe-coated zeolite A catalytic ozonation further reduced the COD up to 90.7%. Comparison of the processes showed the effective performance of the combined process (CW/O<sub>3</sub>/Fe-zeolite) with 97.76% COD reduction of leachate. It is, therefore, concluded that the studied combined process (CW/O<sub>3</sub>/Fe-zeolite A) was more efficient as compared with single ozonation and CW alone, hence it can be implied for the leachate treatment in real conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ikhlaq", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Polymer Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Javed", "ForeName": "Farhan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Management and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Asia", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Hafr Al Batin, Hafr Al Batin, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Qazi", "ForeName": "Umair Yaqub", "Initials": "UY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Masood", "ForeName": "Zafar", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Tanveer", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Zainab", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "Sajeela", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, PR China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Typhaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wetlands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "47"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33307731", "10.1080/15226514.2020.1858753"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
