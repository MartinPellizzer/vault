The doses of ozone, GAC and coagulant were the variables studied for optimization. The effects of different treatment processes on effluent organic matter (EfOM) characteristics, including biodegradability, hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature, and apparent molecular weight (AMW) distribution were also investigated. Compared with ozonation, GAC/O3 not only presented a higher pre-oxidation efficiency, but also improved the treatability of hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds by enhanced coagulation. After treatment by GAC/O3 pre-oxidation (0.6 mg O3 x mg(-1) COD and 20 g x L(-1) GAC) and enhanced coagulation (25 mg x L(-1) Al3+ at pH 5.5), the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colour were higher than those for coagulation alone by 17.3%, 12.0% and 25.6%, respectively. Residual organic matter consisted mainly of hydrophobic acids and hydrophilic compounds of AMW < 1 kDa, which were colourless and of limited biological availability. The combination of GAC/O3 and enhanced coagulation was proved to be a simple and effective treatment strategy for removing EfOM from biotreated textile wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Feiyue", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xianbo", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yongdi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hongyong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complex Mixtures"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Complex Mixtures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24191486", "10.1080/09593330.2012.758662"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
