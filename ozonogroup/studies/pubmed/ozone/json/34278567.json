We used six European adult cohorts which were recruited between 1985 and 2005, pooled within the \"Effects of low-level air pollution: A study in Europe\" (ELAPSE) project, and followed for the incidence of liver cancer until 2011 to 2015. The annual average exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ), particulate matter with diameter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub> ), black carbon (BC), warm-season ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ), and eight elemental components of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (copper, iron, zinc, sulfur, nickel, vanadium, silicon, and potassium) were estimated by European-wide hybrid land-use regression models at participants' residential addresses. We analyzed the association between air pollution and liver cancer incidence by Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders. Of 330\u2009064 cancer-free adults at baseline, 512 developed liver cancer during a mean follow-up of 18.1\u2009years. We observed positive linear associations between NO<sub>2</sub> (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.02-1.35 per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> ), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (1.12, 0.92-1.36 per 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> ), and BC (1.15, 1.00-1.33 per 0.5 10<sup>-5</sup> /m) and liver cancer incidence. Associations with NO<sub>2</sub> and BC persisted in two-pollutant models with PM<sub>2.5</sub> . Most components of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were associated with the risk of liver cancer, with the strongest associations for sulfur and vanadium, which were robust to adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> . Our study suggests that ambient air pollution may increase the risk of liver cancer, even at concentrations below current EU standards."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Authors.
