There is little epidemiologic evidence on the effect of prenatal air pollution exposure on the risk of limb defects.", "To assess the relations between exposure to ambient air pollutants and the risk of limb defects.", "We conducted a matched-pairs case-control study in Taiwan from 2001 through 2007. The case group consisted of 1687 limb defects and the control group was density-sampling matched one to ten based on the month and year of conception from 1510,064 live singleton newborns in 2001-2007. Adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios per 10 ppb change for O3, NO2, 1 ppb change for SO2, 10 \u00b5g/m(3) change for PM10, and 100 ppb change for CO during the first trimester and first three gestational months.", "Of the specific limb defects, reduction deformities of limbs (adjusted OR=1.024, 95% CI: 1.000, 1.048) was associated with a 1 ppb increase in SO2 during weeks of 9-12 of gestation as well as the first trimester. Reduction deformities of limbs was also associated with a 10 ppb increase in O3 during weeks of 1-4 of gestation (adjusted OR=1.391, 95% CI: 1.064, 1.818) among preterm births.", "The present study provides evidence that exposure to outdoor air SO2 during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of limb defects.
