This work investigated the formation of bromate (BrO3(-)) from bromide (Br(-)) in sonolytic ozonation. At neutral pH, the bromate conversion rate ([BrO3(-)]/[Br(-)]0) was increased to 60% by ultrasound at continuous ozone flow (0-0.2Lmin(-1)), much higher than that without ultrasound or without bubbling. This indicates that the promoting effect of sonolysis on BrO3(-) formation is mainly due to the sonolytic decomposition of ozone and the enhancement of gas-liquid transfer. The [BrO3(-)]/[Br(-)]0 was increased with increasing pH. In addition, the reduction of HOBr/OBr(-) with ultrasound demonstrates that bromate may be inhibited as the bromide was formed with the H2O2 generation under ultrasound. This suggests the competition between bromate and bromide during the US/O3 led to the inhibition of bromate formation at high ozone flow. Therefore, our result reveals that the bromate formation under ultrasound is improved remarkably in US/O3 in quick treatment with proper ozone flow (<0.2Lmin(-1))."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
