Semibatch experiments have been performed in order to analyze the influence of pH, bicarbonate ion, temperature and stirring rate on color and organic matter removals. The efficiencies were similar regardless of the pH, which indicates that direct reactions of ozone with wastewater organics were predominant to radical reactions. Gel permeation chromatography confirmed the reduction in the concentration of organics absorbing light at 475 nm after ozonation. The elimination of bicarbonate ion, strong inhibitor of hydroxyl radical reactions, yielded an improvement in both color and COD reduction efficiencies. Acidification for removing bicarbonate ions produced a shift of colored compounds to smaller molecular weights. The highest efficiencies were achieved at 40 degrees C. Color and COD reductions at 40 degrees C were about 90% and 37%, respectively. In no case, the percentage of TOC removed was higher than 10-15%. Stirring rate had a slightly positive effect during the first stage of the ozonation showing that mass transfer played a role only during the initial reaction phase when direct attack of ozone molecules to aromatic/olefinic structures of colored substances was the predominant pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica y Tecnolog\u00eda del Medio Ambiente, Universidad de Valladolid, P(o) Prado de la Magdalena s/n, 47011 Valladolid, Spain. monicacocasanz@yahoo.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coca", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pe\u00f1a", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicarbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "melanoidin polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicarbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molasses"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16054910", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.01.090", "S0045-6535(05)00265-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
