Dosing of the pre-treated wastewater with 5 mg ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) L<sup>-1</sup> led to the elimination of >50% for nearly all investigated PhACs in the ozonation plant, whereas dosing 10 mg O<sub>3</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> increased elimination to >80%. A total hydraulic retention time of 12.8 min proved sufficient for PhAC elimination. Specific ozone consumption and influent dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (8.2-9.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) were in similar ranges for all three performed trials. Combining the MBR with subsequent ozonation at a dosage of 5 mg O<sub>3</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> achieved elimination of >90% and effluent concentrations below 250 ng L<sup>-1</sup> for nearly all the investigated PhACs. Influent concentrations of the MBR were comparable to those found in municipal wastewater. Thus, the recommended dosage for PhAC elimination of 5 mg O<sub>3</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> (i.e. a specific consumption of 0.6 g O<sub>3</sub>*(g DOC)<sup>-1</sup>) is in the same range as for municipal wastewater. However, due to a smaller plant size, the specific costs for treating NH wastewater would significantly exceed those of treating municipal wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Mies-van-der-Rohe-Stra\u00dfe 1, 52074 Aachen, Germany E-mail: daniele.mousel@rwth-aachen.de."}], "LastName": "Mousel", "ForeName": "Dani\u00e8le", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Mies-van-der-Rohe-Stra\u00dfe 1, 52074 Aachen, Germany E-mail: daniele.mousel@rwth-aachen.de."}], "LastName": "Pinnekamp", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nursing Homes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30101762", "10.2166/wst.2018.288"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
