We investigated the trajectory of unresolved palliative care needs of non-cancer patients at home and explored associated factors.", "We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study of elderly non-cancer patients at home in Japan between Jan 2020 and Dec 2020. Physicians assessed their palliative care needs using the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS). Unresolved palliative care needs were defined as IPOS symptoms above 2 (moderate).", "In total, 785 patients were enrolled. The most frequent unresolved palliative care needs at enrollment were poor mobility (n\u2009=\u2009438, 55.8%), followed by weakness/lack of energy (n\u2009=\u2009181, 23.1%) and poor appetite (n\u2009=\u2009160, 20.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that female and musculoskeletal disease were significantly positively associated with pain at starting home visits (OR\u2009=\u20091.89, <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.015; OR\u2009=\u20092.69, <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.005).
