The system reproducibly measured the deposition of microspheres in control rats, and the procedure was shown to be sufficiently sensitive to measure ozone-induced changes in deposition rates. Rats exposed to 1.2 ppm ozone 6 h/d for 2 consecutive days showed greater deposition of the 1.09-micron-, 2.02-micron-, and 2.99-micron- but not of the 0.48-micron-diameter microspheres when compared to controls. After 8 consecutive days of exposure to the same concentration of ozone, there were no differences in deposition rates between control and ozone-exposed rats. Respiratory physiology and lung histopathology data provided evidence that subtle changes in the airway architecture and/or aerodynamics were likely to be responsible for the differential deposition rates as a function of the duration of ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shiotsuka", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osheroff", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drew", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microspheres"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staining and Labeling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2437314", "10.1080/15287398709530998"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
