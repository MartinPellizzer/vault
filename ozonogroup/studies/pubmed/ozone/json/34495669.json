Here, we estimated the ozone formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAP) of anthropogenic and biogenic VOC emissions to evaluate (1) anthropogenic VOCs and associated sectors that dominate OFP and SOAP and (2) the potential impacts of enhanced biogenic VOCs from urban greening programs on air quality in Los Angeles county. In the present-day scenario, ethylene had the largest OFP followed by <i>m</i> & <i>p</i>-xylene, toluene, propylene, and formaldehyde. The top five contributors to SOAP were toluene, mineral spirits, benzene, heptadecane, and hexadecane. Mobile and solvent sources were the dominant VOC sources for both OFP and SOAP. The potential increases in biogenic VOC emissions due to future urban greening had significant effects on urban air quality that offset the benefits of reducing anthropogenic VOC emissions. This study demonstrates that urban greening programs in Los Angeles county, and likely other cities as well, need to account for both anthropogenic and biogenic VOC contributions to secondary pollution, and greening cities should consider using vegetation types with low VOC emissions to avoid further degradation to urban air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Guenther", "ForeName": "Alex", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4987-023X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Faiola", "ForeName": "Celia", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34495669", "10.1021/acs.est.1c01481"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
