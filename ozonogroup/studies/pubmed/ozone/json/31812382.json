Little is known about the characteristics of growth, physiological metabolism, bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) and mineral nutrients in urban trees under the combination of soil Cd contamination and elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure. In this study, one-year-old street tree Catalpa ovata G. Don seedlings were exposed to Cd contaminated soil (0, 100, 500\u00a0mg/kg soil) with 40\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> O<sub>3</sub> (ambient air) and 120\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> O<sub>3</sub> (elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure) for 4\u00a0weeks. The results revealed that 500\u00a0mg/kg soil Cd addition alone decreased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, peroxidase activity and increased abscisic acid content and oxidative injury in the leaves of C. ovata. Furthermore, Cd soil contamination decreased leaf, stem, root and total biomass and affected Cd, Mg, Fe, and Zn contents in leaves (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but it did not affect Mg, Fe and Zn contents in roots. O<sub>3</sub> exposure did not affect growth, net photosynthetic rate, Cd accumulation and mineral nutrient contents of C. ovata. No interactive effect between Cd and O<sub>3</sub> was found on growth, oxidative injury, photosynthetic rate, and the contents of Cd, Mg, Fe and Zn in plant tissues (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Our findings suggest that C. ovata is an appropriate tree species for urban greening and afforestation in heavy industrial urban areas with high O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Northeast China. To ensure successful afforestation in heavy industrial areas, the long-term and large scale studies are needed to advance our understanding of the combined effects from extreme climate conditions and multi-pollutant exposure on the metabolism of mature urban trees."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
