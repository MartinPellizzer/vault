However, these advantages come with additional challenges to beamline optics, camera and sample due to increased heat load and radiation damage, and to personal safety due to higher radiation dose and ozone gas hazards. In this work, a white beam imaging facility at imaging beamline BL-4, Indus-2, has been developed, while taking care of various instrumental and personal safety challenges. The facility has been tested to achieve 1.5\u2005\u00b5m spatial resolution, increased penetration depth up to 900\u2005\u00b5m in steel, and high temporal resolutions of \u223c10\u2005ms (region of interest 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels) and 70\u2005\u00b5s (256 \u00d7 2048 pixels). The facility is being used successfully for X-ray imaging, non-destructive testing and dosimetry experiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai 400085, India."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Ashish K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai 400085, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Balwant", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai 400085, India."}], "LastName": "Singhai", "ForeName": "Payal", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai 400085, India."}], "LastName": "Kashyap", "ForeName": "Yogesh", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Physics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai 400085, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Mayank", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Synchrotron Radiat", "NlmUniqueID": "9888878", "ISSNLinking": "0909-0495"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34475311", "10.1107/S160057752100775X", "S160057752100775X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
