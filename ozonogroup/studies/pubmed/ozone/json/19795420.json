To explore whether the vitamin D effects are modified by estrogen therapy, we report a largely cross-sectional, analysis of the association between sun exposure, which is an important vitamin D source, and colorectal cancer risk among postmenopausal women in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists study. Among 21,695 participants, there were a total of 108 cases. Sun exposure was based on time outdoors and on ambient ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure based on residence linked to erythemal exposures derived from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer database. Although there was no relationship between outdoor time or ambient UV measure and colorectal cancer risk in current hormone replacement therapy (HRT) users, in never/past HRT users, there was an inverse association with higher ambient UV exposure, RR for highest vs. lowest tertile = 0.40; 95% CI 017, 0.93; p for trend = 0.04. Non-significant lower risks were also associated with higher levels of outdoor time (> or = 3.5 hr/week) in never/past HRT users. The interaction between both indicators of sun exposure and HRT and CRC risk was not significant. These data, although exploratory, are consistent with evidence from the WHI suggesting a decrease in colorectal cancer risk may be associated with vitamin D exposure among postmenopausal women who are not taking HRT, but not among current HRT users."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freedman", "ForeName": "D Michal", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajaraman", "ForeName": "Preetha", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuhrman", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoffbeck", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "Bruce H", "Initials": "BH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "Z01 CP010133-13", "Acronym": "ImNIH", "Agency": "Intramural NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0042124", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7136"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Colorectal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Replacement Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postmenopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Garland CF, Garland FC.
