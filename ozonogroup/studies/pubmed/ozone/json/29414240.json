Strength and surface chemistry are vital variables for these film-based endeavors, the former is one of the assets of nanocellulose. To contribute to the latter, nanocellulose films are tuned with a side-specific functionalization, having an aldehyde and a carboxyl side. The functionalities were obtained combining premodification of the film components by periodate oxidation with ozone post-treatment. Periodate oxidation of cellulose nanocrystals results in film components that interact through intra- and intermolecular hemiacetals and lead to films with an elastic modulus of 11 GPa. The ozone treatment of one film side induces conversion of the aldehyde into carboxyl functionalities. The ozone treatment on individual crystals was largely destructive. Remarkably, such degradation is not observed for the self-standing film, and the film strength at break is preserved. Preserving a physically intact film despite ozone treatment is a credit to using the dry film structure held together by interparticle covalent linkages. Additionally, gas-phase post-treatment avoids disintegration that could result from immersion into solvents. The crystalline cellulose \"Janus\" film is suggested as an interfacial component in biomaterial engineering, separation technology, or in layered composite materials for tunable affinity between the layers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Chalmers University of Technology , Gothenburg 41296 , Sweden."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0158-467X"], "LastName": "Nypel\u00f6", "ForeName": "Tiina", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural and Microbial Products Chemistry , National Research Centre , Dokki, Giza , Egypt 12622."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amer", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konnerth", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1981-2271"], "LastName": "Potthast", "ForeName": "Antje", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6636-9260"], "LastName": "Rosenau", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "I 2247", "Acronym": "FWF_", "Agency": "Austrian Science Fund FWF", "Country": "Austria"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biomacromolecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100892849", "ISSNLinking": "1525-7797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29414240", "10.1021/acs.biomac.7b01751"]}}]}
