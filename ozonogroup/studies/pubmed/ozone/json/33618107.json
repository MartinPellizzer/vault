Therefore, while O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> has been considered a critical chain carrier for promoting O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), the direct reactions of O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> with micropollutants have been assumed to be insignificant during ozonation. In this study, we monitored the exposures of O<sub>3</sub>, \u2022OH, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> by following the depletion of O<sub>3</sub>, p-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA, as \u2022OH probe), and tetrachloromethane (CCl<sub>4</sub>, as O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> probe) during ozonation of various water matrices (surface water, groundwater, and secondary wastewater effluent). For a given water matrix, the ratio between \u2022OH and O<sub>3</sub> exposures (R<sub>ct</sub>), O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> exposures (R<sub>SO</sub>), as well as O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and \u2022OH exposures (R<sub>SH</sub>) remained almost constant over the entire reaction time. This suggests that during ozonation, the ratios between the transient concentrations of \u2022OH and O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and \u2022OH were also constant and equaled to the R<sub>ct</sub>, R<sub>SO</sub>, and R<sub>SH</sub>, respectively. Based on the O<sub>3</sub>, \u2022OH, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> exposures observed during ozonation, a chemical kinetic model was proposed to simulate the abatement of ten ozone-resistant micropollutants in the three water matrices by ozonation. The results indicate that due to the higher concentrations of O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> than \u2022OH (R<sub>SH</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0~5-8), the reactions with O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> played a non-negligible or even dominant role in the abatement of some micropollutants that have similar or higher O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> reactivity than \u2022OH reactivity (e.g., tetrachloroethylene, chloroform, and PFOA). Compared with the previous model that neglected the contribution of O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> to micropollutant abatement, the proposed model more accurately simulated the abatement efficiencies of the test micropollutants during ozonation. These results indicate that the proposed model can provide a useful tool for the generalized prediction of micropollutant abatement by ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
