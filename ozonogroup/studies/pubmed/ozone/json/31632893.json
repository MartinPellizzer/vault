More recently, however, several single-model studies have proposed that ozone-depleting substances might also be important drivers of BDC trends. As these studies were conducted with different forcings over different periods, it is difficult to combine them to obtain a robust quantitative picture of the relative importance of ozone-depleting substances as drivers of BDC trends. To this end we here analyze - over identical past and future periods - the output from 20 similarly-forced models, gathered from two recent chemistry-climate modeling intercomparison projects. Our multi-model analysis reveals that ozone-depleting substances are responsible for more than half of the modeled BDC trends in the two decades 1980-2000. We also find that, as a consequence of the Montreal Protocol, decreasing concentrations of ozone-depleting substances in coming decades will strongly decelerate the BDC until the year 2080, reducing the age-of-air trends by more than half, and will thus substantially mitigate the impact of increasing CO<sub>2</sub>. As ozone-depleting substances impact BDC trends, primarily, via the depletion/recovery of stratospheric ozone over the South Pole, they impart seasonal and hemispheric asymmetries to the trends which may offer opportunities for detection in coming decades."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, NY USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Atmospheric Reseach, Boulder, CO USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polvani", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, NY USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abalos", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Met Office Hadley Centre, Exeter, Devon, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Butchart", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chipperfield", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dameris", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meteorological Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deushi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dhomse", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00f6ckel", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Atmospheric Reseach, Boulder, CO USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinnison", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France/CNRS, Toulouse, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michou", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, Wellington, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgenstern", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oman", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climate Research Branch, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Montreal, QC Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plummer", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stone", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Goddard Space Flight Center NASA", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "N-999999", "Agency": "Intramural NASA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Geophys Res Atmos", "NlmUniqueID": "9882986", "ISSNLinking": "2169-897X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abalos M, Polvani L, Calvo N, Kinnison D, Ploeger F, Randel W, & Solomon S (2019).
