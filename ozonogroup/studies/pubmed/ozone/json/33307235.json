All samples were decoronated maintaining root length of 12\u202fmm and embedded vertically in acrylic resin. Shaping of the canal was performed using reciprocating system. Canals were dried using paper points and obturated with gutta percha via lateral condensation. Peso-reamers were used to create post space up to 10\u202fmm. The post space was irrigated with 1% NaOCl before being randomly allocated into four groups (n\u202f=\u202f10) according to different methods of canal disinfection. Samples in group 1 were subjected to photoactivated disinfection (PAD), group 2 irrigated with ethanol based propolis group 3 disinfected using ozone and group 4 irrigated with 2.25 % NaOCl with 17 % EDTA and ECL. GFP was fitted using SERC. Each sample was cut into 1\u202fmm from coronal, middle and apical and subjected to pushout bond strength (PBS) via universal testing machine. Fracture analysis were confirmed by stereomicroscope at 40x magnification. For comparison of means, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple comparison test was used maintaining the level of significance at p\u202f<\u202f 0.05.", "The highest PBS at all three levels were found in group 4, canal disinfected with 2.5 % NaOCl with 17 % EDTA and ECYL. Whereas, the lowest PBS was observed in group 1. Inter group comparison, prosthetic space disinfected with propolis extract showed no significant difference to group 4 canal disinfected with 2.5 % NaOCl with 17 % EDTA and ECYL at all three levels (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Intra group comparison in all experimental groups showed no significant difference was noted in coronal and middle thirds of group 1, group 2 and group 3 respectively (p\u202f>\u202f0.05).", "2.5 % NaOCl with EDTA and ECL treatment (group 4) remains the gold standard when used as a final canal irrigant. Propolis can be used as potential irrigant for canal disinfectant provided if the composition becomes standardized."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
