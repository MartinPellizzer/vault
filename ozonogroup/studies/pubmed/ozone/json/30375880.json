Urban environments are expressly vulnerable to global warming because of the extensive emission of air pollutants with urban heat island effect enhancing much rapidly the ozone concentration than in the less urbanized regions. This effect previously was not studied in local scale. It was hypothesized that climate change will cause heterogenic increase of ozone concentration in the different parts of the cities. To study this effect, the near-surface ozone concentration of 10 points of a Hungarian city was measured and modeled. At first step, the local correlations between solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and the near surface ozone concentrations at 3\u00a0m height were determined, specifying the local ozone-producing conditions. Then, based on the scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th assessment report, the future seasonal near-surface ozone concentrations were modeled. Based on the model, it was determined that climate change will result in a heterogenic increase of near-surface ozone concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Environmental Engineering , University of Pannonia , Veszpr\u00e9m , Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Limnology , University of Pannonia , Veszpr\u00e9m , Hungary."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3248-6474"], "LastName": "Tr\u00e1jer", "ForeName": "Attila J\u00e1nos", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Environmental Engineering , University of Pannonia , Veszpr\u00e9m , Hungary."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4535-3494"], "LastName": "Nagy", "ForeName": "Georgina", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Limnology , University of Pannonia , Veszpr\u00e9m , Hungary."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8405-4414"], "LastName": "Domokos", "ForeName": "Endre", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hungary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30375880", "10.1080/09603123.2018.1539703"]}}]}
