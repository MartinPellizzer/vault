In this study, a kind of low-cost and environmental-friendly modified ceramsite sphere derived from pyrite cinder, silty clay and kaolin was prepared as ozonation catalyst. The degradation performances of cation red x-GRL were performed under a continuous mode. Being close to the practical treatment, continuous-flow ozonation study is vital for applying heterogeneous catalytic ozonation in wastewater treatment at a large industrial scale. Results showed that the absorption capacity of this modified ceramsite towards cation red x-GRL was confirmed to be slight. The mineralization efficiency was high, accounting for 48.0% of 200 mg/L cation red x-GRL at a constant flow rate of 0.18 L/min (hydraulic retention time = 16 min), while only 7.8% during ozonation alone. Furthermore, this novel catalytic ozonation can maintain high mineralization efficiency in a wide range of pH (3-10), which was ascribed to the synergistic catalytic performance of various oxides. The reaction mechanism is ascribed to the promotion of \u00b7OH production from O<sub>3</sub> molecules' decomposition. Moreover, ozone utilization efficiency at hydraulic retention time of 16 min during catalytic ozonation was 2.0 times as high as that during ozonation alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resources Reuse, School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China and Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, 200092, Shanghai, China E-mail: wudeli@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resources Reuse, School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China and Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, 200092, Shanghai, China E-mail: wudeli@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Deli", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resources Reuse, School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China and Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, 200092, Shanghai, China E-mail: wudeli@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hongping", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Red X-GRL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30767922", "10.2166/wst.2019.008"]}}]}
