This study measured the non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) simultaneously for the first time at three different heights, namely ground, 118\u00a0m and 488\u00a0m, in the Canton Tower located in the urban core of the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The results show that NMHCs decreased while some OVOC species such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde increased with increasing height. It was mainly attributed to the dilution and chemical loss of NMHCs but secondary production of OVOCs during vertical transport. Ratio analysis and receptor modeling indicate that vehicle exhausts (47%) and fuel evaporation (39%) were major sources of the total NMHCs. Interestingly, industry contributed much more at 118\u00a0m, probably affected by organic gas discharge from the high chimney of industrial factories. The chemical reactivities in terms of OH radical loss rate (L<sub>OH</sub>), ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP) were lowest at 118\u00a0m, smaller than those influenced by high fresh NMHC emissions at ground and strong formation of secondary species (e.g. OVOCs) at 488\u00a0m. OH exposure estimated by isoprene and m,p-xylene/ethylbenzene was different depending on their time scale of vertical turbulent mixing and chemical loss. OVOC species measured at different heights were positively correlated with O<sub>x</sub> (R\u00a0=\u00a00.48-0.87), indicating that OVOCs were largely contributed by secondary formation in photochemical process. The tower measurements of NMHCs and OVOCs provided a unique opportunity to investigate the VOC distribution and chemical behaviors, which could give important information for understanding O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution mechanism in the PRD region with fast developing urban setting and substantially changing air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
