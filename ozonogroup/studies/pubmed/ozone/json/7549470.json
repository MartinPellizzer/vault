During the summer (May-September) and winter (November-March), subjects measured their lung function two to four times daily at home for one week periods, and every hour recorded their symptoms, medication, and activity hourly in diaries. Almost all subjects recorded heart rates (HR), which were converted to ventilation rate (VR) estimates using individual laboratory exercise data. Most subjects' lung function and symptoms varied diurnally, and were worst in early morning. For subjects with clinically mild asthma, diurnal forced expired volume in 1 sec (FEV1) changes averaged 7%, versus 12% in those with moderate symptoms, and 18% in severely asthmatic subjects. Lung function was similar in summer and winter, but symptoms and medication use decreased in winter. In the aggregate, subjects reported spending 75% of waking hours indoors at self-rated slow activity and 11% in vehicles. HR records usually corroborated reports of medium or fast activity. Mean estimated VR at slow, medium, and fast activity was 19, 37, and 61 L/min for men, and 16, 24, and 32 L/min for women. Outdoor fast activity, representing the greatest vulnerability to outdoor pollution, occupied approximately 0.2% of waking hours (2 min/day on average); outdoor medium activity occupied about 2% of waking hours (19 min/day on average). Estimated cumulative ventilation was higher than that of previous healthy panels because of asthmatics' higher VR at slow activity. If these activity patterns are typical, asthmatics may be especially vulnerable to pollutants with effects dependent on cumulative inhaled dose. Effects dependent on high inhaled dose rates over a short period, e.g., sulfur dioxide effects, would be unlikely, except perhaps for uncommonly active individuals in uncommonly polluted areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, Downey, CA 90242, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shamoo", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linn", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Webb", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hackney", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9111438", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4245"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical Records"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7549470"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
