The diamine oxidase activity is inhibited in vivo by exposure of the plants to ozone (dose of 0.6 microliters per liter x hour), whereas the peroxidase activity associated with the wall space is stimulated. This dose does not cause obvious necrosis or chlorosis of the leaf. These alterations are greater when the dose of ozone exposure is given as a triangular pulse (a slow rise to a peak of 0.24 microliters per liter followed by a slow fall) compared to that given as a constant square wave pulse of 0.15 microliters per liter for the same 4 hour period. Exposure of the plants to sulfur dioxide (at a concentration of 0.4 microliters per liter for 4 hours) does not result in any change in the diamine oxidase or peroxidase activities, yet the total sulfhydryl content of the leaf is increased, demonstrating the entry of sulfur dioxide. These two pollutants, with different chemical reactivities, affect the activities of the extracellular enzymes in different manners. In the case of ozone exposure, the inhibition of extracellular diamine oxidase could profoundly alter the movements of polyamines from cell to cell."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California, Riverside, California 92521."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peters", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castillo", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heath", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1967 Mar 15;132(2):521-3", "ArticleIdList": ["4961900"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Apr;74(4):846-51", "ArticleIdList": ["16663520"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1985 Sep;79(1):62-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16664402"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1983 Feb 1;220(2):623-7", "ArticleIdList": ["6401986"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Aug;68(2):494-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16661943"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16666508", "PMC1055812", "10.1104/pp.89.1.159"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
