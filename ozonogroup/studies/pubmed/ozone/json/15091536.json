Rice plants were exposed to ozone 4 weeks before and 3 weeks after (13)CO(2) feeding. The dry weight of whole plants decreased with increasing ozone concentration, whereas net photosynthetic rate (apparent CO(2) uptake per unit leaf area) was unaffected, compared with the control, at the time of (13)CO(2) feeding. Dry matter distribution into leaf sheaths and culms was reduced more than that into leaf blades by ozone exposure. Although panicle dry weight per plant was reduced by ozone, the percentage of panicle dry weight to the whole plant tended to increase considerably. Exposure to ozone accelerated translocation of (13)C from source leaves to other plant parts. Partitioning of (13)C to panicles and roots was higher under ozone treatment than in the control. Respiratory losses of fixed (13)C from plants tended to decrease under treatment with ozone. The increase in photoassimilate partitioning in panicles can be considered to be an acclimation response of rice plants to complete reproductive stage under the restricted biomass production caused by ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Agro-Environmental Sciences, 3-1-1 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nouchi", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harazono", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kouchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091536", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)93437-5", "0269749195934375"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
