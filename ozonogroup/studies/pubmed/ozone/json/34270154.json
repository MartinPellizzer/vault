Ethanedinitrile (C<sub>2</sub> N<sub>2</sub> ) is a new potential alternative fumigant and has been investigated as a timber fumigant because it has shown better penetration through timber and responds fast to insects and nematodes. This article reports on laboratory and commercial-scale trials with C<sub>2</sub> N<sub>2</sub> for important wood destroying pests namely Tomicus piniperda (Pine bark beetle) adults, Hyphantria cunea (Fall webworm) lavae, Reticulitermes speratus (Japanese Termite) adults and Cryphalus fulvus (Scolytidae) (Yellow minute bark beetle) which naturally infests pine logs.", "Tomicus pi:niperda adults were more tolerance than H. cunea lavae and R. speratus adults with lethal concentration \u00d7 time affecting 99% mortality (LCt<sub>99</sub> ) values of 27.84, 7.49 and 3.30\u2009g\u2009h\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> , respectively. Ethanedinitrile shows exceptionally high toxicity to adult R. speratus which was almost 26 times more toxic than methyl bromide. The complete control of larvae and adults stages of C. fulvus was achieved at concentration \u00d7 time (Ct) products from 89.6\u00a0g\u2009h\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> in a 6-8\u00a0L fumigation chamber.
