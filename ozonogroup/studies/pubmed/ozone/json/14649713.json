Alpha endosulfan solutions were ozonated in a lab-scale semi-batch reactor under variable experimental conditions. Increase in dissolved ozone concentration had a positive effect on oxidation rate. Alpha endosulfan could be removed up to 94% at pH 4 for an ozonation time of 60 minutes. The oxidation reaction was found to be of second order and of first order with respect to both ozone and alpha endosulfan. The temperature dependent reaction expression of alpha endosulfan was obtained as kd = (1.889 exp(- 2.21 x 10(-3)/T). It was concluded that, although the rate of reaction was lower than the rate of other pesticide oxidation reported in the literature. alpha endosulfan presented an obvious reaction to ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey. yazgan@itu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yazgan", "ForeName": "Mustafa S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinaci", "ForeName": "Cumali", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toroz", "ForeName": "Ismail", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OKA6A6ZD4K", "NameOfSubstance": "Endosulfan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endosulfan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14649713", "10.1081/PFC-120025564"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
