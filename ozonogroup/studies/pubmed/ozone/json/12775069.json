The destruction of the organic is initiated by hydrogen-atom abstraction through OH radicals which are produced via the reaction of the photolytically generated O(1D) with the solvent water at a quantum yield of phi(*OH) of about 0.1. There is no decomposition of ozone in the dark on the time scale of the photolysis experiment. The efficiency of tertiary butanol destruction with respect to ozone consumption ([O3]0 = 3 x 10(-4) M), defined by the ratio delta[t-BuOH]/delta[O3], termed eta(t-BuOH), is 0.26 at millimolar tertiary butanol concentrations, determined at the stage of essentially complete ozone consumption. It diminishes toward lower tertiary butanol concentrations (delta[t-BuOH]/delta[O3] approximately 0.17 at [t-BuOH]0 = 1 x 10(-4) M). Part of the effect of the ozone, apart from being a source of *OH radicals, rests on the intervention of HO2*/O2*- which is produced in the course of the peroxyl-radical chemistry of the tertiary butanol in this dioxygen-saturated environment and converted into further *OH radical by reaction with ozone. Moreover in this system, organic free radicals and peroxyl radicals react with the ozone. On the basis of the experimental and mechanistic-simulation data, the quantum yield of direct (by hv) ozone cleavage in aqueous solution is estimated at about 0.5."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Strahlenchemie, Stiftstrasse 34-36, P.O.
