However, it is unclear how the hyperpnea of exercise may modulate these effects, and the subsequent consequences on exercise performance. We tested the hypothesis that pulmonary function and exercise capability would be diminished, and symptom development would be increased during peak real-world levels of O<sub>3</sub> exposure compared with room air. Twenty aerobically trained participants [13 M, 7 F; maximal O<sub>2</sub> uptake (V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub>), 64.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0 mL\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>] completed a three-visit double-blinded, randomized crossover trial. Following a screening visit, participants were exposed to 170 ppb O<sub>3</sub> or room air (<10 ppb O<sub>3</sub>) on separate visits during exercise trials, consisting of a 25-min moderate-intensity warmup, 30-min heavy-intensity bout, and a subsequent time-to-exhaustion (TTE) performance test. No differences in O<sub>2</sub> uptake or ventilation were observed during submaximal exercise between conditions. During the TTE test, we observed significantly lower end-exercise O<sub>2</sub> uptake (-3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3%, <i>P</i> = 0.004), minute ventilation (-3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5%, <i>P</i> = 0.043), tidal volume (-3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.008), and a trend toward lower exercise duration in O<sub>3</sub> compared with room air (-10.8\u2009\u00b1\u200926.5%, <i>P</i> = 0.092). As decreases in O<sub>2</sub> uptake and alterations in respiratory pattern were also present at matched time segments between conditions, a limitation of oxygen transport seems likely during maximal exercise. A more comprehensive understanding of the direct mechanisms that limit oxygen transport during exercise in high-pollutant concentrations is key for mitigating performance changes.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We demonstrate that in highly trained endurance athletes, exposure to peak real-world levels of O<sub>3</sub> air pollution (170 ppb) significantly diminishes O<sub>2</sub> uptake along with corresponding changes in ventilation during maximal exercise. As no differences were observed during extended submaximal exercise, a combined effect of effective dose of pollution and exercise intensity on severity of responses seems likely."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9563-4924"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["https://ror.org/03rmrcq20"], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Harris", "ForeName": "Owen D", "Initials": "OD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["https://ror.org/03rmrcq20"], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "Patric E O", "Initials": "PEO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["https://ror.org/03rmrcq20"], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Andy", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["https://ror.org/03rmrcq20"], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Stothers", "ForeName": "Bennett", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2258-6562"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur, LAMHESS, Nice, France."}], "LastName": "Bougault", "ForeName": "Val\u00e9rie", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5779-5014"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["https://ror.org/03rmrcq20"], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Sheel", "ForeName": "A William", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7026-8422"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["https://ror.org/03rmrcq20"], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Sports Medicine, Department of Family Practice, UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Koehle", "ForeName": "Michael S", "Initials": "MS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "6563", "Agency": "Canadian Government | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "RTI-2021-00091", "Agency": "Canadian Government | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "RGPIN-2017-04519", "Agency": "Canadian Government | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Athletes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Endurance"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bicycling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38660726", "10.1152/japplphysiol.00085.2024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
