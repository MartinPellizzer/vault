The scintillation that results from random density fluctuations, as well as the consequences of regular chromatic refraction, is qualitatively described. The resultant chromatic scintillation will produce random features on the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) spectrometer, with an amplitude comparable with that of some of the real absorbing features that result from atmospheric constituents. A correction method that is based on the use of fast photometer signals is described, and its efficiency is discussed. We give a qualitative (although accurate) description of the phenomena, including numerical values when needed. Geometrical optics and the phase-screen approximation are used to keep the description simple."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalaudier", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kan", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurvich", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18357067", "10.1364/ao.40.000866", "63611"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
