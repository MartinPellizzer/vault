It was found that coupling O<sub>3</sub> and VUV resulted in a considerable synergistic catalytic effect on FAV removal. The VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process performed better in moderately alkaline conditions than in acidic ones; complete FAV degradation and 99.4% TOC removal were achieved within 10 and 60\u00a0min, respectively. HO<sup>\u2022</sup> played the dominant role in FAV degradation, with a second-order reaction rate constant with HO<sup>\u2022</sup> at 1.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>10</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. The VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process could effectively treat tap water spiked with FAV. Efficient FAV and TOC removal, as well as total bacterial inactivation, was attained when treating municipal secondary effluent by the VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process. Finally, the VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process was operated in a continuous-flow mode in a fluidized-bed (FBR) reactor for treating FAV-spiked tap water. Complete degradation and 75.1% mineralization of 10\u00a0mg/L FAV were obtained at a hydraulic retention time of 1 and 8\u00a0min, respectively. The findings clearly suggest that the VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process operated in a continuous-flow FBR is a promising, efficient technology for the removal of novel and emerging contaminants, such as the antiviral FAV."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
