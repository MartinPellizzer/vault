C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>12</sub> nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were measured using whole-air sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In 2016 and 2017, online methane and ethane measurements were also conducted. Strong methane-ethane correlation identified oil and gas (O&G) upstream and midstream operations to be the primary methane source. C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> alkanes were the dominant NMHCs whose average mixing ratio peaked in 2016 before dropping in 2017. This observation is attributed to regional O&G upstream operations, which peaked in 2015. Mean mixing ratios of C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> alkanes ranged from 0.99 to 16.99 ppb. Measured ratios of i-C<sub>5</sub>/ n-C<sub>5</sub> were 0.97 \u00b1 0.03, 1.18 \u00b1 0.04, and 1.06 \u00b1 0.02 in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, indicating that O&G upstream and midstream operations were their primary source. Photochemical age was estimated using observed ratio between hexane and propane. Emission ratios of NMHCs at zero photochemical age were calculated, which resembled the composition reported in the literature for natural gas field condensate tank flashing. Back-trajectory analysis showed that hydrocarbon-rich plumes came from the south and west directions, where O&G upstream and midstream operations are abundant. High OH reactivity values were calculated from C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkanes mixing ratios, with the average reactivity for the 3 years being 1.55, 1.88, and 1.16 s<sup>-1</sup>. This indicates that VOC emissions from O & G operations may contribute to ozone production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5888-0616"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phillips 66 Research Center , Highway 60 and 123, Bartlesville , Oklahoma 74003 , United States."}], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Buddhadeb", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oklahoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29439573", "10.1021/acs.est.7b05726"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
