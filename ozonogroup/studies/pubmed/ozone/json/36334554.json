Early treatment of herpes zoster neuralgia is of great significance to reduce the incidence of PHN. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of high-voltage pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and oxygen-ozone(O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>) injection in patients with acute zoster neuralgia (AZN) who failed to respond to conservative treatment.", "One-hundred patients diagnosed with AZN were classified into two groups (high-voltage PRF group [HP group, n\u00a0=\u00a050] and high-voltage PRF combined with O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> injection group [HPO group, n\u00a0=\u00a050]) based on different treatment methods. Therapeutic effectiveness was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The dosages of gabapentin and tramadol (mg/d) before treatment and after 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment were measured. The incidence of clinically meaningful PHN after treatment was also recorded.", "Pain intensity and sleep quality in both groups at all time points improved after treatment compared to before treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After 1 week and 1 month of treatment, NRS and PSQI scores in both groups decreased, but the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). NRS, PSQI scores, and the dosages of gabapentin and tramadol decreased more significantly in the HPO group than those in the HP group after 3 months (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The incidence of PHN was significantly lower in the HPO group than in the HP group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no significant differences in adverse events between the groups.", "High-voltage PRF is a safe and effective method for treating AZN. The combination of high-voltage PRF and O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> injection is superior to high-voltage PRF alone for treating late-stage AZN. This approach could be recommended as an alternative treatment for patients with refractory AZN and could significantly reduce the risk of PHN."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Central Clinical School, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300192, China; Department of Pain Medicine, The First Hospital of Qinhuangdao, Hebei 066000, China.
