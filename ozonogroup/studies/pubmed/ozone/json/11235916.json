Enzymatic hydroxylation was evaluated by a microsomal assay. Fischer 344 male rats (250 g) injected with 5-aminosalicylic acid (100 mg x kg(-1) i.p.; 30 min) were exposed to ozone (0, 1, 2 ppm; nose only, 2 h); bronchoalveolar lavage, lung homogenates, and plasma were recovered. Oxidation products of 5-aminosalicylic acid were as follows: salicylic acid, by deamination; 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, from radical or enzymatic hydroxylation; 5-amino-2-hydroxy-N,N'-bis(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-benzoquinonediimine, a condensation product of oxidized 5-aminosalicylic acid; and 5-amino-2,3,4,6-tetrahydroxybenzoic acid, attributed to hydroxyl radical attack without deamination, identified by HPLC electrochemical (HPLC-EC) detector system analysis and by GC-MS analysis of trimethylsilyl derivatives. 5-Aminotetrahydroxybenzoic acid was not formed enzymatically. 5-Aminotetrahydroxybenzoic acid, but not 5-aminosalicylic acid, was significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage (+86%) and lung homogenates (+56%) in response to 2 ppm ozone (p < 0.05); no significant changes were detected in plasma. The data indicate that hydroxylation of 5-aminosalicylic acid is a potential specific probe for in vivo oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Directorate, Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada. premkumari_kumarathasan@hc-sc.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumarathasan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vincent", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goegan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Potvin", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu\u00e9nette", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8606068", "ISSNLinking": "0829-8211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Q81I59GXC", "NameOfSubstance": "Mesalamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mesalamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11235916"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
