We estimated the effect of daily O<sub>3</sub> on emergency department (ED) visits for selected respiratory outcomes in 5 US cities under various model assumptions and assessed model fit. Population-weighted average 8-h maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were estimated in each city. Individual-level data on ED visits were obtained from hospitals or hospital associations. Poisson log-linear models were used to estimate city-specific associations between the daily number of respiratory ED visits and 3-day moving average O<sub>3</sub> levels controlling for long-term trends and meteorology. Linear, linear-threshold, quadratic, cubic, categorical, and cubic spline O<sub>3</sub> C-R models were considered. Using linear C-R models, O<sub>3</sub> was significantly and positively associated with respiratory ED visits in each city with rate ratios of 1.02-1.07 per 25\u2009ppb. Models suggested that O<sub>3</sub>-ED C-R shapes were linear until O<sub>3</sub> concentrations of roughly 60\u2009ppb at which point risk continued to increase linearly in some cities for certain outcomes while risk flattened in others. Assessing C-R shape is necessary to identify the most appropriate form of the exposure for each given study setting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. vbarry@emory.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barry", "ForeName": "Vaughn", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klein", "ForeName": "Mitchel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winquist", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Howard H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulholland", "ForeName": "James A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talbott", "ForeName": "Evelyn O", "Initials": "EO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rager", "ForeName": "Judith R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tolbert", "ForeName": "Paige E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarnat", "ForeName": "Stefanie Ebelt", "Initials": "SE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES019776", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 ES011294", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101262796", "ISSNLinking": "1559-0631"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflicts of interest:</b> All authors report no conflicts of interest including no competing financial interests"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ji M, Cohan DS, Bell ML.
