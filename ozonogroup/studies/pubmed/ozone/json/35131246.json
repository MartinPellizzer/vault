The reaction kinetics, chemical yields and mechanisms were assessed for the ozonation of potential precursors including dimethylamine (DMA), N,N-dimethylsulfamide, hydrazines, N-containing water and wastewater polymers, dyes containing a dimethylamino function, N-functionalized carbon nanotubes, guanidine, and phenylurea. The effects of bromide on the NDMA formation during ozonation of different types of precursors were also discussed. The mechanism for NDMA formation during ozonation of DMA was re-summarized and new perspectives were proposed to assess on this mechanism. Effect of hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) on NDMA formation during ozonation was also discussed due to the noticeable oxidation of NDMA by \u2022OH. Surrogate parameters including nitrate formation and UV<sub>254</sub> after ozonation may be useful parameters to estimate NDMA formation for practical application. The strategies for NDMA formation control were proposed through improving the ozonation process such as ozone/hydrogen peroxide, ozone/peroxymonosulfate and catalytic ozonation process based on membrane pores aeration (MEMBRO<sub>3</sub>X)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
