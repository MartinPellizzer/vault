In this study, a novel ozone micronano-bubble (MNB)-enhanced treatment system was constructed for antibiotic production wastewater treatment. Compared with conventional ozone, ozone MNBs exhibit excellent treatment efficiency for oxytetracycline (OTC) degradation and toxicity decrease. Notably, this study identifies the overlooked singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) for the first time as a crucial active species in the ozone MNB system through probe and electron paramagnetic resonance methods. Subsequently, the oxidation mechanisms of OTC by ozone MNBs are systematically investigated. Owing to the high reactivity of OTC toward <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, ozone MNBs enhance the selective and anti-interference performance of OTC degradation in raw OTC production wastewater with complex matrixes. This study provides insights into the mechanism of ozone MNB-enhanced pollutant degradation and a new perspective for the efficient treatment of high-concentration industrial wastewater using ozone MNBs. In addition, this study presents a promising technology with scientific guidance for the treatment of antibiotic production wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9846-8925"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Sining", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, Institute of Environmental Research at Greater Bay, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou510006, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Lianpeng", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0084-9229"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou510275, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "X20I9EN955", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytetracycline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6214-20-6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytetracycline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36474357", "10.1021/acs.est.2c06008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
