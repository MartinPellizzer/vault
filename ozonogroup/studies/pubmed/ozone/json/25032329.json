Researchers have used these markers to discover indications of pulmonary damage from low-level ozone, a finding with serious implications for health professionals and environmental regulators. <b>Biologic Markers in Pulmonary Toxicology</b> is a comprehensive study of this use of biologic markers. Focusing on the respiratory tract as an entryway for airborne pollutants, this volume reviews new ways of measuring markers, the need for markers to indicate dose or exposure levels, noninvasive respiratory function tests for use with healthy humans to detect sensitivity to inhaled pollutants, approaches to evaluating markers down to the cellular and biochemical levels, and more."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1989 by the National Academy of Sciences."}, "Sections": [{"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Subcommittee on Pulmonary Toxicology"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Committee on Biologic Markers"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Commission on Life Sciences"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Preface"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Executive Summary"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "1", "SectionTitle": "Introduction"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "2", "SectionTitle": "Markers of Exposure"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "3", "SectionTitle": "Markers of Physiologic Effects in Intact Organisms"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "4", "SectionTitle": "Markers of Altered Structure or Function"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "5", "SectionTitle": "Markers of Inflammatory and Immune Response"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "6", "SectionTitle": "Markers of Cellular and Biochemical Response"}, {"Section": [], "LocationLabel": "7", "SectionTitle": "Conclusions and Recommendations"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "References"}, {"Section": [], "SectionTitle": "Biographies"}]}, "PubmedBookData": {"History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25032329"]}}]}
