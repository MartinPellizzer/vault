The VOCs concentrations were 94.3 \u00b1 157.8 ppbv and 20.7 \u00b1 8.9 ppbv for industrial and urban sites, respectively. Alkanes and aromatics were the major contributors to VOCs in industrial site, while oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) contributed most in urban site. The most abundant VOC species were n-pentane and formaldehyde for industrial site and urban site, respectively. The calculated ozone formation potential (OFP) and OH loss rates (L<sub>OH</sub>) were 621.1 \u00b1 1491.9 ppbv (industrial site), 102.9 \u00b1 37.3 ppbv (urban site), 22.0 \u00b1 39.0 s<sup>-1</sup> (industrial site) and 5.3 \u00b1 2.2 s<sup>-1</sup> (urban site), respectively. Based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, solvent utilization I (34.1 %), solvent utilization II (27.9 %), mixture combustion source (19.3 %), OVOCs related source (9.6 %) and biogenic source (9.1 %) were identified in the industrial site, while OVOCs related source (27.8 %), vehicle exhaust (22.1 %), solvent utilization (19.3 %), coal combustion (16.0 %) and biogenic source (14.8 %) were identified in the urban site. The results of O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NOx sensitivity indicated that O<sub>3</sub> formation were respectively under the VOC-limited and NOx-limited conditions in Beijing urban and industrial regions. Additionally, aromatics accounted remarkable SOA formation ability both in the two sites, and SOA potentials of xylene, toluene and ethylbenzene as the indicator species for the solvent utilization in industrial site were remarkable higher than those obtained in urban regions. The hazard index values in the industrial and urban sites were 1.72 and 3.39, respectively, suggesting a high non-carcinogenic risks to the exposed population. Formaldehyde had the highest carcinogenic risks in the two sites, and the cumulative carcinogenic risks in the industrial site and urban site were 1.95 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> and 1.21 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup>, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
