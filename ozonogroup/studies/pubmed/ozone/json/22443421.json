Although the net photosynthetic rate of the flag leaf in Norin 61 was not significantly reduced by exposure to O(3), that in Shirogane-komugi was significantly reduced by the exposure to O(3) during the anthesis and early grain-filling stages. In the two cultivars, stomatal diffusive conductance to H(2) O of the flag leaf was not significantly affected by the exposure to O(3). The exposure to O(3) induced significant reductions in the activity and concentration of Rubisco, activities of catalase (CAT) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) and concentrations of reduced form of ascorbate and total glutathione of the flag leaf in Shirogane-komugi. It was concluded that the sensitivity of net photosynthesis of flag leaf to O(3) is higher in Shirogane-komugi than in Norin 61, and the difference in the sensitivity to O(3) between the two cultivars is mainly due to that in the effects of O(3) on the detoxification ability of ROS, mainly determined by the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes, such as CAT and MDAR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 Physiologia Plantarum 2012."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inada", "ForeName": "Hidetoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "Taisuke", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Nahid", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoshino", "ForeName": "Daiki", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "Masahiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izuta", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.4", "NameOfSubstance": "monodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22443421", "10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01618.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
