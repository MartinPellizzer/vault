The major product was ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, that was identified with its mid-infrared and near-ultraviolet absorption lines. Oxygen atoms were formed on photolysis of O<sub>2</sub> and stored in solid neon until the temperature of a sample was increased to 9 K, which enabled their migration and combination to form O<sub>3</sub> and likely also O<sub>2</sub>. O<sub>2</sub> in five excited states and O in two excited states detected through the emission spectra indicate that complicated processes occurred in solid Ne after far-ultraviolet excitation.
