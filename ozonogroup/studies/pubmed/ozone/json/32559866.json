Annual averages ranged between 4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> with peaks exceeding 40\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>. A slight monthly variation was observed with maximum and minimum values in the cold (\u223c6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) and warm (\u223c4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) seasons respectively. A diurnal pattern was found with a weak amplitude (\u223c3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>). The monthly trends were investigated using surface observations and OMI (Ozone Monitoring instrument) satellite measurements. An unexpected upward trend was obtained in the last five years. The periods with elevated NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the last years were analyzed, showing an increase in its frequency and concentrations, linked with the upward trend observed. The weather conditions in these NO<sub>2</sub> peaks were studied using local surface meteorology, mean sea level pressure and wind fields from the data reanalysis of ERA5. The transport of NO<sub>2</sub> was explored using TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) measurements. The events occurred under conditions governed by high-pressure systems, which induced weak synoptic airflows or the development of mesoscale processes. Four scenarios of NO<sub>2</sub> transport were identified, associated with weak synoptic flows from inland or Southern Portugal and with mesoscale processes. The gulf of Cadiz plays an important role as a reservoir where the NO<sub>2</sub> coming from the south of Portugal, the Western Mediterranean Basin and urban-industrial areas can be accumulated and later transported inland. A strong correlation was found between the increase of NO<sub>2</sub> observed in the last years and positive anomalies of the temperature and geopotential height at 850 and 500\u00a0hPa levels. These findings could indicate that the causes of the changes in the NO<sub>2</sub> would be attributed to alterations in the weather patterns associated with a warmer climate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
