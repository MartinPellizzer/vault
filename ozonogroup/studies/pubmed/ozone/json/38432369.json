It draws attention to the possible health risks-acute and chronic poisoning, cancer, unfavorable effects on reproduction, and harm to the brain or immunological systems-that come with pesticide exposure. Numerous traditional and cutting-edge methods, such as washing, blanching, peeling, thermal treatments, alkaline electrolyzed water washing, cold plasma, ultrasonic cleaning, ozone treatment, and enzymatic treatment, have been proposed to reduce pesticide residues in food products. It highlights the necessity of a paradigm change in crop protection and agri-food production on a global scale. It offers opportunities to guarantee food safety through the mitigation of pesticide residues in food. The review concludes that the first step in reducing worries about the negative effects of pesticides is to implement regulatory measures to regulate their use. In order to lower the exposure to dietary pesticides, the present review also emphasizes the significance of precision agricultural practices and integrated pest management techniques. The advanced approaches covered in this review present viable options along with traditional methods and possess the potential to lower pesticide residues in food items without sacrificing quality. It can be concluded from the present review that a paradigm shift towards sustainable agriculture and food production is essential to minimize pesticide residues in food, safeguarding human health, wildlife populations, and the environment. Furthermore, there is a need to refine the conventional methods of pesticide removal from food items along with the development of modern techniques."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
