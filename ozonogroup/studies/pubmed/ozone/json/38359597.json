Different factors impact the biological stability of drinking water (DW) in the distribution networks, such as the presence and concentration of nutrients, water temperature, pipe material composition, hydrodynamic conditions, and levels of disinfectant residual. This review aimed to evaluate the current state of knowledge on strategies for DW biofilm disinfection through a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the literature published over the last decade. A systematic review method was performed on the 562 journal articles identified through database searching on Web of Science and Scopus, with 85 studies selected for detailed analysis. A variety of disinfectants were identified for DW biofilm control such as chlorine, chloramine, UV irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and others at a lower frequency, namely, electrolyzed water, bacteriophages, silver ions, and nanoparticles. The disinfectants can impact the microbial communities within biofilms, reduce the number of culturable cells and biofilm biomass, as well as interfere with the biofilm matrix components. The maintenance of an effective residual concentration in the water guarantees long-term prevention of biofilm formation and improves the inactivation of detached biofilm-associated opportunistic pathogens. Additionally, strategies based on multi-barrier processes by optimization of primary and secondary disinfection combined with other water treatment methods improve the control of opportunistic pathogens, reduce the chlorine-tolerance of biofilm-embedded cells, as well as decrease the corrosion rate in metal-based pipelines. Most of the studies used benchtop laboratory devices for biofilm research. Even though these devices mimic the conditions found in real DWDS, future investigations on strategies for DW biofilm control should include the validity of the promising strategies against biofilms formed in real DW networks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
