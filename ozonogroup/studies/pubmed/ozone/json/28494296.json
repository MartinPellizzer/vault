Little is known about its impacts on soybean production in this key agricultural region. Accumulated O<sub>3</sub> exposure-response and stomatal O<sub>3</sub> flux-response relationships were developed during two continuous growing seasons to evaluate O<sub>3</sub>-induced yield reduction of four typical soybean cultivars in Northeast China. Results showed that critical levels of AOT40 (accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over a threshold of 40nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>), SUM06 (sum of all hourly average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over 0.06\u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>) and W126 (sum of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations weighted by a sigmoidal function) in relation to 5% reduction in relative seed yield were 4.2, 7.6 and 6.8\u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h, respectively. The effect of O<sub>3</sub> on plants was influenced by leaf position in canopy. An improved Jarvis stomatal conductance model including leaf (node) position fitted well with field measurements. The best linear relationship between stomatal O<sub>3</sub> flux and relative soybean yield was obtained when phytotoxic ozone dose was integrated over a threshold of 9.6nmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> (POD<sub>9.6</sub>) to represent the detoxification capacity of soybean. POD<sub>9.6</sub> and the commonly used POD<sub>6</sub> in relation to 5% reduction in relative seed yield of soybean were 0.9mmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup> and 1.8mmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> concentrations above ~38nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup> contributed to POD<sub>9.6</sub> and caused seed yield loss in soybean. Current annual yield loss of soybean at ambient O<sub>3</sub> was estimated to range between 23.4% and 30.2%. The O<sub>3</sub> dose-response relationships and corresponding thresholds obtained here will benefit regional O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment on soybean production in Northeast China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
