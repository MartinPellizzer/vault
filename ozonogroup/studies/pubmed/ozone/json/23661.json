In order to explain this discrepancy, lysozyme has been modified with 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenylsulfenyl chloride (NCPS-Cl). This reagent reacts with the indole ring of tryptophan giving a 2-thioaryl-derivative. By chromatographic fractionation of the reaction mixture, a lysozyme derivative was isolated, that by sequence studies was proved to be modified only at Trp-108 retaining 10% of the lytic activity. Physico-chemical as well as kinetic studies indicate that the large decrease in activity following modification could be related to minor effects in the microenvironment of the active site, with a concomitant modification of the ionization constants of the groups involved in catalysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bocc\u00f9", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veronese", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fontana", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fenassi", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Acta Vitaminol Enzymol", "NlmUniqueID": "0135063", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8924"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfenic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8DUH1N11BX", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptophan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Muramidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V956696549", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylglucosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylglucosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muramidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfenic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tryptophan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23661"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
