It is important to propose environmentally friendly methods, which may enhance plant growth physiology and yield without affecting soil microbial community as much. In this context, irrigation with ozonated water could be a potential strategy to reduce some chemical compounds in soils due to the degradative power of ozone. Here, we studied the impact of irrigation with ozonated water on the microbial community of a Mediterranean soil, and on Solanum lycopersicum L. agro-physiology and productivity in a greenhouse experiment. To this end, we evaluated: i) soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activities, microbial biomass via fatty acid analysis, microbial diversity (via amplicon sequencing), and ii) the nutrient content, physiology, phytohormone content, yield, and fruit quality of tomato plants. Our results indicate that soil physicochemical properties were significantly affected by the irrigation with ozonated water (OZ). We observed an increase in the content of total organic carbon (TOC), water-soluble nitrogen (WSN) and ammonium, and a decrease in soil pH due to the OZ treatment. In addition, a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase and fungal and bacterial biomass was also observed in the OZ treatment. It was observed that the prokaryotic community structure was affected by the OZ treatment, while that of fungi was undisturbed. The OZ treatment increased the photosynthetic rates of tomato plants and maintained water conditions when compared to control plants. The increased trans-Zeatin riboside (tZ-Rib) could provide rapid apical and root growth allowing adaptation to the new growing conditions. However, a more in-depth study on the physiological response of the plant to this treatment would be of interest, as it would help with the implementation of this strategy in agricultural fields in a safe manner, and with obtaining higher plant yields."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
