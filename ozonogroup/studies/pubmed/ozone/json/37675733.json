Although it is commonly seen, it lacks effective treatment. Our previous study found that ozone could alleviate neuropathic pain. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) or tissue factor (TF)-mediated neuroinflammation and microcirculation disturbance is the main reason for CIPN. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 is an endogenous negative feedback regulator of inflammation via TLR4 inhibition.", "Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) was used to establish mice's CIPN model. Nociceptive responses were assessed by observing the ICR mice's incidence of foot regression in mechanical indentation response experiments. Cell signaling assays were performed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The mouse leukemia cells of monocyte-macrophage line RAW 264.7 were cultured to investigate the effects of ozone administration on macrophage.", "Ozone decreased the expression of TF in the blood and sciatic nerve. It upregulated the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-SOCS3 axis to relieve CIPN and inhibit TF expression in vivo. SOCS3 expression was induced by ozone to inhibit the p38/TF signaling in RAW 246.7 cells. Ozone also prevented L-OHP-induced sciatic nerve demyelination. Microglia activation was inhibited, and c-Fos and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression was decreased in the spinal dorsal horn via ozone.", "In this study, we demonstrated that ozone could alleviate CIPN by upregulating the AMPK-SOCS3 axis to inhibit TF expression, which is a potential treatment for CIPN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong; Department of Oncology, Affiliated Qingdao Central Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao Cancer Hospital, Qingdao, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Tao", "Initials": "XT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Zong", "ForeName": "Li-Juan", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Ru-Meng", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xin-Miao", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Shi-Rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Affiliated Qingdao Central Hospital of Qingdao University; Qingdao Cancer Prevention and Treatment Research Institute, Affiliated Qingdao Central Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao Cancer Hospital, Qingdao, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Lin-Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Management, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-Tao", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Management, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Cancer Res Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101249598", "ISSNLinking": "1998-4138"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.31", "NameOfSubstance": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neuralgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "45"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37675733", "10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_912_23", "JCanResTher_2023_19_4_1031_384529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
