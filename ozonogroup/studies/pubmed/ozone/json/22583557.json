Ozone is a strong oxidant but, if used in small dosages on human blood ex vivo, acts as an acceptable stressor. By instantly reacting with PUFA bound to albumin, ozone is entirely consumed but generates two messengers acting in an early and in a late phase: the former is due to hydrogen peroxide, which triggers biochemical pathways on blood cells and the latter is due to alkenals which are infused into the donor patient. After undergoing a partial catabolism, alkenals enter into a great number of body's cells, where they react with Nrf2-Keap1 protein: the transfer of activated Nrf2 into the nucleus and its binding to antioxidant response element (ARE) is the crucial event able to upregulate the synthesis of antioxidant proteins, phase II enzymes and HO-1. With the progress of ozonetherapy, these protective enzymes are able to reverse the oxidative stress induced by chronic inflammation. Consequently, the repetition of graduated stresses induces a multiform adaptive response able to block the progress of the disease and to improve the quality of life."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, University of Siena, Italy. bocci@unisi.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bocci", "ForeName": "Velio", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22583557", "10.3109/10715762.2012.693609"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
