Hindcast simulation was done over the CSEA domain for two historical O3 episodes, January 26-29, 2004 (January episode, northeast monsoon) and March 24-26, 2004 (March episode, southwest monsoon). Experimental forecast was done for next-day hourly O3 during January 2006 over the central part of Thailand (CENTHAI). Available data from 20 ambient monitoring stations in Thailand and 3 stations in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, were used for the episode analysis and for the model performance evaluation. The year 2000 anthropogenic emission inventory prepared by the Center for Global and Regional Environmental Research at the University of Iowa was projected to the simulation year on the basis of the regional average economic growth rate. Hourly emission in urban areas was prepared using ambient carbon monoxide concentration as a surrogate for the emission intensity. Biogenic emissions were estimated based on data from the Global Emissions Inventory Activity. Hindcast simulations (CSEA) were performed with 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree resolution, whereas forecast simulations (CENTHAI) were done with 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree hourly emission input data. MM5-CMAQ model system performance during the selected episodes satisfactorily met U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criteria for O3 for most simulated days. The experiment forecast for next-day hourly O3 in January 2006 yielded promising results. Modeled plumes of ozone in both hindcast and forecast cases agreed with the main wind fields and extended over considerable downwind distances from large urban areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering and Management Program, School of Environment, Resources and Development, Asian Institute of Technology, Pathumthani, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nghiem", "ForeName": "Le Hoang", "Initials": "le H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim Oanh", "ForeName": "Nguyen Thi", "Initials": "NT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18939781"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
