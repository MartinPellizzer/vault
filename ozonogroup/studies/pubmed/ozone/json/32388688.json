We assessed the impact of air pollutants on the risk of asthma outpatients and emergency hospital visits in Shenyang, China. A distributed lag non-linear model with a Poisson regression was used to assess the short-term effects of air pollutants on asthma outpatient and emergency hospital visits between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. Confounding factors were adjusted using natural cubic splines. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and suspended particulates <\u200910\u00a0\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>) were positively associated with the number of asthma hospital visits. The largest cumulative effects of O<sub>3</sub>, CO, and PM<sub>10</sub> on hospital visits were on lag day 2 (RR\u2009=\u20091.163, 95% CI 1.051-1.287) for 0-5-year-old childhood asthma, on lag day 3 (RR\u2009=\u20091.386, 95% CI 1.136-1.69) for asthma in winter, and on lag day 10 (RR\u2009=\u20091.148, 95% CI 0.942-1.399) for female asthma, respectively. The cumulative effect of air pollution represented by the air quality index (AQI) was largest on lag day 10 for 0-5-year-old childhood asthma with an increase of 28.6% (95% CI 6.5-55.4) hospital visits every IQR increment of the AQI. CO, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> were the main air pollutants in Shenyang city. Children with bronchitis asthma were more vulnerable to air pollution during the cold season."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Huaxiang Road, No. 39, Tiexi District, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Office, Environmental Monitoring Experiment Center of Liaoning Province, Shuang Road, No. 30 A3, Hunnan District, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Office, Environmental Monitoring Experiment Center of Liaoning Province, Shuang Road, No. 30 A3, Hunnan District, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zongjiao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Office, Environmental Monitoring Experiment Center of Liaoning Province, Shuang Road, No. 30 A3, Hunnan District, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7105-3204"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Huaxiang Road, No. 39, Tiexi District, Shenyang, China. 963649760@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hehua", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017YFC0907401", "Agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biometeorol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374716", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Outpatients"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32388688", "10.1007/s00484-020-01934-9", "10.1007/s00484-020-01934-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
