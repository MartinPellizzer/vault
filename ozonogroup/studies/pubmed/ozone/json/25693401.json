A pulse-chase labeling experiment was designed to expose potted rice with 13CO2 for 6 h after one and two months, the rice were fumigated by elevated O3 concentration with an 8 h mean of 110 nL \u00b7 L(-1) (O3). The allocation of the assimilated 13C to soil microorganisms was estimated by analyzing the 13C profile of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). After one month O3 exposure, the soil microbial biomass carbon was not affected, while the 13C-microbial biomass was significantly decreased with elevated O3. Both the total and 13C microbial biomass carbon was remarkably lower than that of control treatment after two months O3 exposure. Principal components analysis of 13C-PLFA data showed that elevated O3 significantly changed soil microbial structure after two month exposures, while there was no difference of 13C-PLFA structure between control and elevated O3 treatments after one month exposure. \u0394\u03b413C per hundred thousand of individual PLFA was significantly affected by O3 after both one and two month exposures. Only did ozone change the relative abundance of individual 13C-PLFA (13C%) of bacterial fatty acids after one month exposure, while after two month exposures, the 13C% of fungal and actinomycetic fatty acids were markedly changed by elevated O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ke", "Initials": "XK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "He", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isotope Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25693401"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
