The energetics have been refined with CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) theoretical approaches with the same basis set based on the geometries calculated at the QCISD method. The intermediates of hydrogen-bonded complexes and the critical transition states are also examined with the multireference methods. Two possible reaction pathways containing hydrogen-abstraction and association-elimination processes for the interaction of HCO with O3 are proposed. Both reaction mechanisms can occur via the prereactive hydrogen-bonded complex, O3-HCO, with 2.45 kcal/mol stability at the CCSD(T) approach with respect to the reactants; even so, the hydrogen-abstraction mechanism exhibits a lower energy barrier. The rate constants for both processes are also predicted. The total rate constant at 298 K is calculated to be in close agreement with the experimental value of 8.3 \u00d7 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Center for Nanotechnology, Chung Yuan Christian University , Chungli 32023, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Chen-Chi", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Mei-Ya", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yu-Huan", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hsin-Tsung", "Initials": "HT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24739084", "10.1021/jp4127013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
