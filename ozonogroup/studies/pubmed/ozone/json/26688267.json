This combination of tests consists of: i) an analysis of emerging contaminants, to be added to the established physico-chemical parameters in order to understand the causes of (new) pollution phenomena and ii) some of the bio-analytical tools most widely applied in the field of wastewater research, which provide information on groups of chemicals with a common mode of toxic action (baseline toxicity, estrogenicity and mutagenicity/genotoxicity, selected as the most representative for human health). The negative effects of the discharge can thus be highlighted directly and used to assess the global environmental impact of WWTPs. As a validation, this multi-tiered approach was applied to a full-scale WWTP (150,000 p.e.), where different measurements were carried out: EDCs (Endocrine Disrupting Compounds) detection; algal growth inhibition, bioluminescence inhibition and acute toxicity test (for baseline toxicity); an E-Screen-like assay (for estrogenic activity); Ames, Allium cepa and Comet tests (for mutagenic/genotoxic activity). As a result, the WWTP showed good performance for all these issues, displaying its ability to enhance effluent quality, except for residual mutagenic behaviour, probably due to the by-products generated by the tertiary ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
