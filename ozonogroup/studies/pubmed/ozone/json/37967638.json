Utilizing K-means clustering, four patterns of O<sub>3</sub> variation were identified: Cluster 1 (extremely low O<sub>3</sub>), Cluster 2 (close to autumn average), Cluster 3 (abnormally high O<sub>3</sub> at night), and Cluster 4 (extremely high O<sub>3</sub>). In Cluster 1, the PRD was situated on the northwest side of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), resulting in increased cloud cover, weakened radiation, and the lowest O<sub>3</sub> growth rate during the day, with weak nighttime changes. Cluster 2 presents O<sub>3</sub> changes under normal autumn conditions, closely resembling the autumn average. In Cluster 3, the PRD was located between continental high pressure and the low-pressure system over the South China Sea. The enhanced horizontal pressure gradient led to an increase in the horizontal wind speed, promoting the formation of a low-level jet (LLJ). The LLJ caused decoupling between the residual layer and stable boundary layer at night, leading to increased surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration and a higher background O<sub>3</sub> concentration before sunrise the next day. In Cluster 4, favorable meteorological conditions for O<sub>3</sub> generation and accumulation were created by the influence of the WPSH and peripheral tropical cyclones. O<sub>3</sub> rapidly increased during the day, reaching extremely high values in the afternoon, with an exceedance rate of 80\u00a0%. Comparing the four diurnal patterns and their meteorological conditions highlights the significance of meteorological processes in O<sub>3</sub> variations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
