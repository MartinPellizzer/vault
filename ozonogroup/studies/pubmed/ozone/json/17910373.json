Electrolysis and electrolysis with nitrogen aeration were characterized by a rapid decrease in 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BODs) and total nitrogen and a slow decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD). In contrast, ozonation, electrolysis with oxygen aeration, and electrolysis with ozone aeration were characterized by transformation of persistent organic matter to biodegradable matter and preservation of total nitrogen. The best energy efficiency in removing BOD5 and total nitrogen was demonstrated by electrolysis, as a result of direct anodic oxidation and indirect oxidation with free chlorine produced from the chloride ion (Cl-) at the anodes. However, electrolysis with ozone aeration was found to be superior to the other processes, in terms of its energy efficiency in removing COD and its ability to remove COD completely, as a result of hydroxyl radical (*OH) production via cathodic reduction of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Solution Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, Otsu, Japan. naoyuki@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kishimoto", "ForeName": "Naoyuki", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Yukako", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuno", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yasuda", "ForeName": "Yuuji", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ruthenium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ruthenium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17910373", "10.2175/106143007x184023"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
