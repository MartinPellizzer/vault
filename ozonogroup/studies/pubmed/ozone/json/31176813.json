Therefore, photodegradation experiments and electrochemical degradation were performed to identify abiotic and putative biotic transformation products (TPs). Indirect rather than direct photodegradation proved to be important for denatonium removal by solar irradiation and produced seven TPs. Amide hydrolysis, hydroxylation, N-dealkylation, and N-dearylation were revealed as the main mechanisms. Anodic oxidation of denatonium was related to the formation of overall ten products and despite considerable different yields, all TPs from indirect photodegradation were mimicked electrochemically. Among them, lidocaine was the only TP detected after conventional wastewater treatment and in surface waters. The occurrence of lidocaine was however associated with its application as local anesthetic rather than to a degradation of denatonium. The absence of additional products suggests that denatonium degradation is negligible under environmental conditions, supporting the previously described persistent nature of this compound. Advanced water treatment techniques however have the potential to degrade denatonium. About 74% of the initial denatonium load was removed from wastewater during pilot-scale ozonation. The degradation of denatonium was accompanied here with the formation of at least two polar products, which are passing unchanged through a sand filter after ozonation. Both substances have completely unknown (toxicological) properties and this study seems to be the first report about their structures in general, as none of them was found in any of the large compound libraries (e.g. PubChem)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
