Given that high temperature (HT) accelerates O<sub>3</sub> production, it is of significance to determine whether co-exposure to HT exacerbates O<sub>3</sub>-induced airway inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine the possible promotive effect of HT on O<sub>3</sub>-induced airway inflammation and underlying mechanisms. Forty-eight C57BL/6\u00a0N male mice were randomly divided into four groups: filtered air (control), O<sub>3</sub>, HT, and HT\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> (co-exposure) groups. Mice in control and O<sub>3</sub> groups were exposed to filtered air or 1\u00a0ppm O<sub>3</sub> at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, while mice in HT and co-exposure groups were exposed to filtered air or 1\u00a0ppm O<sub>3</sub> at 36\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The exposure scenario for four groups was 4\u00a0h/d for 5 consecutive days. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were collected 24\u00a0h after the last exposure and subjected to examinations of oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metabolic profiling. Lung tissues were processed for H&E histological staining. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> inhalation triggered oxidative stress and inflammation in the airways, which was worsen by co-exposure to HT. Further studies revealed that co-exposure to HT strengthened O<sub>3</sub>-induced decline in Firmicutes and Allobaculum in airways. Moreover, co-exposure to HT promoted O<sub>3</sub>-induced airway metabolic disorder. Spearman correlation analysis revealed correlations among microbiota dysbiosis, metabolic disorder, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by co-exposure to HT and O<sub>3</sub>. Taken together, HT exposure aggravates O<sub>3</sub>-induced airway oxidative stress and inflammation, possibly through modulation of microbiota and metabolism of the airways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
