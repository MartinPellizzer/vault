Exposure to ADSS at 30 mg/m3 of total suspended particulates (TSP) for 6 h/day for 3 days, followed by exposure to ozone at 0.5 ppm for 24 h was associated with a significant increase in the number of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) compared with exposure to ADSS alone or ozone alone. The proportion of neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as total protein level in BAL, was also significantly elevated following ADSS/ozone exposure, when compared with all other groups. Within the centriacinar regions of the lungs, the percentage of proliferating cells identified by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling was unchanged from control, following exposure to ADSS alone, but was significantly elevated following exposure to ozone (280% of control) and further augmented in a statistically significant manner in mice exposed to ADSS/ozone (402% of control). Following exposure to ozone or ADSS/ozone, the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to release interleukin (IL)-6 under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was significantly decreased, while exposure to ADSS or ADSS/ozone caused a significantly increased release of tumor necrosis factor alpha from AM under LPS stimulation. We conclude that ADSS exposure enhances the sensitivity of animals to ozone-induced lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Comparative Respiratory Biology and Medicine, Institute of Toxicology and Environmental Health, and California Regional Primate Research Center, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, California 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Mang", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinkerton", "ForeName": "Kent E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witschi", "ForeName": "Hanspeter", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES05707", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR00169", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Toxicol Sci. 2002 Jan;65(1):1-3. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/65.1.1", "PMID": "11752678"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Chemical Sensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11752689", "10.1093/toxsci/65.1.99"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
