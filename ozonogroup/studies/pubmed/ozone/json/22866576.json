The target gaseous pollutant for the biofiltration experiment was approximately 300 ppmv of toluene. Toluene removal efficiency (RE, %) was initially approximately 20% with a 247-ppmv concentration (0.9 g m(-3)) of toluene during the first 10 days. Although the RE decreased several times whenever nitrogen was consumed, it again reached almost 100% when the nitrogen source was in sufficient supply. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis was employed to assess the transformation ofmicroflora during operation of the biofilter The results based on a 16S rRNA gene profile showed that the microbial community structure changed with operation time. Although the microflora changed during the initial period (before day 40), transformation of the bacterial component was hardly observed after day 51. Statistical analyses of the DGGE profiles indicated that the bacterial community was almost unaffected by the environmental factors, such as adding ozone, high-level nitrogen supply, increase of loading toluene, and the shutdown of the RSB. The DGGE profile using tmoA-like genes, which encode proteins belonging to the hydroxylase component mono-oxygenases involved in the initial attack of aerobic benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene degradation, confirmed the existence of toluene-degrading bacteria. There were at least four kinds of toluene-degradable bacteria having tmoA-like genes up to day 36, which decreased to two species after day 40. Sequence analysis after DGGE profiling revealed that Burkholderia cepacia, Sphingobacterium multivorum, and Pseudomonas putida were present in the biofilter. Only Alicycliphilus denitrificans was present throughout the whole operation period. In the initial stage of operating the RSB, many types of bacteria may have tried to adapt to the conditions, and subsequently, only selected bacteria were able to grow and to degrade toluene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okunishi", "ForeName": "Suguru", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Yasutaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higuchi", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "Hiroto", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishi", "ForeName": "Katsuji", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Bacterial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Nucleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Bacterial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22866576", "10.1080/10962247.2012.672396"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
