In this study, nine typical malodorous compounds were selected to reveal that Cu(II)-enhanced ozonation can greatly promote the decay of fatty amines because of the direct ozone oxidation, which was enhanced to promote ozone utilization. Moreover, trace Cu(II) can amplify the observed rate constants of dimethylamine and trimethylamine for 48.9% and 155.7%, respectively, and Cu(II) dosage was the determining factor using response surface methodology to investigate the interactions between initial pH, Cu(II) dosage and ozone dosage. These results demonstrated that the formation of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> was inhibited rather than promoted, which was quite different from some previously reported Cu(II)-enhanced ozonation counterparts. Moreover, the enhanced effect of trace Cu(II) was exhibited in both single and complex malodorous compounds. The conversion pathway of nitrogen and sulfur elements was clarified, with the targeted mineralization of nitrogen of nitrogen-containing malodorous compounds into NO<sub>3</sub>-N and the odor characteristics of sulfur-containing malodorous compounds disappeared. These findings provided new insight for utilizing metal ions to enhance the direct ozone oxidation capacity of malodorous compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
