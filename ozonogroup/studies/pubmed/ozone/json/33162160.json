The influence of operational conditions and inorganic anions on the mineralization of OFX were also studied. Results showed that OFX could be rapidly oxidized by both O<sub>3</sub> alone and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. The mineralization of OFX was significantly enhanced (55%) in peroxone process, compared with that in ozonation alone (30%). The direct oxidation of OFX by ozone molecules might account for the degradation of OFX in both ozonation and peroxone process, whereas, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the improvement of the ozone decomposition and the formation of OH radicals were responsible for enhancing OFX mineralization. The applied dosage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was important for the performance of peroxone process in OFX mineralization. The addition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> enhanced OFX mineralization, while the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> had negative effect on OFX mineralization in both ozonation and peroxone processes. Ozonation process might be a promising technology for the degradation of OFX, while the combination process of O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could be an effective method for the improvement of the mineralization of refractory organic pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
