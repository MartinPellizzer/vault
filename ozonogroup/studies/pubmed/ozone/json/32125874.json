However, the subjects' exposures to indoor and outdoor air pollution in the hours and days before each controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposure may have modified biomarker responses to the controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposures.<b>Objectives:</b> We sought to determine whether personal measures of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub>, or ambient concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, particulate matter \u22642.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter, NO<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the 72 and 96 hours before the exposure visit modified biomarker responses to controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposure.<b>Methods:</b> MOSES subjects were exposed for 3 hours in random order to clean air containing 0 ppb O<sub>3</sub>, 70 ppb O<sub>3</sub>, or 120 ppm O<sub>3</sub>, alternating 15 minutes of moderate exercise with 15 minutes of rest. Cardiovascular and pulmonary endpoints (biomarkers of autonomic function, repolarization, ST segment change, arrhythmia, prothrombotic vascular status, systemic inflammation, vascular function, pulmonary function, oxidative stress, and lung injury) were measured on the day before, the day of, and up to 22 hours after each exposure. We evaluated whether ambient pollutant concentrations in the 96 hours before the pre-exposure visit modified pre- to post-exposure lung function biomarker responses to the controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposures, using tertiles of passive personal exposure samplers (PES) of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, ambient air pollutant concentrations, and mixed effects linear regression. We also similarly explored the effect modification of controlled O<sub>3</sub> effects on biomarkers of other MOSES outcome groups in the same way. Although we used <i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.01 to define statistical significance, we did not formally correct for multiple comparisons.<b>Results:</b> The effects of MOSES controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposures on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were modified by ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and CO, and PES NO<sub>2</sub>. Reductions in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were observed only when these concentrations were in the \"medium\" or \"high\" tertile in the 72 hours before the pre-exposure visit. There was no such modification of the effect of controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposure on any other cardiopulmonary outcome group.<b>Conclusions:</b> Reductions in markers of lung function, but not other pathways, by the MOSES controlled O<sub>3</sub> exposure were modified by ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and CO, and PES NO<sub>2</sub>, and these reductions were observed only when these pollutant concentrations were elevated in the hours and days before the pre-exposure visit.Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01487005)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7132-0069"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York."}], "LastName": "Rich", "ForeName": "David Q", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York."}], "LastName": "Thurston", "ForeName": "Sally W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2246-7002"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "John R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and."}], "LastName": "Bromberg", "ForeName": "Philip A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0116-9217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Arjomandi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and."}], "LastName": "Hazucha", "ForeName": "Milan J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and."}], "LastName": "Alexis", "ForeName": "Neil E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Ganz", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York."}], "LastName": "Zareba", "ForeName": "Wojciech", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York."}], "LastName": "Thevenet-Morrison", "ForeName": "Kelly", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard T.
