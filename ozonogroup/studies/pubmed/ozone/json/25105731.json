Additionally, the generation of hydrochloric acid contributes to high concentrations of acid rain and to ozone layer depletion. En route to synthesizing salts that contain cationic FOX-7, a novel, high oxygen-containing oxidizer, tetranitroacetimidic acid (TNAA), has been synthesized and fully characterized. The properties of TNAA were found to be exceptional, with a calculated specific impulse exceeding that of AP, leading to its high potential as a replacement for AP. TNAA can be synthesized easily in a one-step process by the nitration of FOX-7 in high yield (>93%). The synthesis, properties, and chemical reactivity of TNAA have been examined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Idaho , Moscow, Idaho 83844-2343, United States."}], "LastName": "Vo", "ForeName": "Thao T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parrish", "ForeName": "Damon A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shreeve", "ForeName": "Jean'ne M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Am Chem Soc. 2014 Nov 12;136(45):16102"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25105731", "10.1021/ja5074036"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
