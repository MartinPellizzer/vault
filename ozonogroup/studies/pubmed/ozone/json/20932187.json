The surfaces were untreated (Control) or treated with ozone (HealOzone, KaVo) or Nd:YAG laser (Fidelis III, Fotona). Coronal and root dentins of 10 teeth of each group were treated with a two-step self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray Medical; SE), whereas the remaining 10 teeth were treated with a one-step self-etch adhesive (Clearfil Tri-S Bond, Kuraray Medical; S3). A resin composite (Clearfil Majesty Esthetics, Kuraray Medical) was then placed, and SBS was tested with a universal testing machine. Failure modes were determined under a stereomicroscope. The mean SBS values of each group were calculated, and data were subjected to statistical analysis (p = 0.05).", "For the coronal dentin, Control/SE showed significantly higher values than Control/S3, Ozone/S3, and Nd:YAG/S3. Although Ozone/SE showed significantly higher values than Nd:YAG/S3 (p < 0.05), the differences within the other groups were not significant for the root dentin (p > 0.05). Comparison of two dentin substrates in each group did not show any significant difference except for Control/SE, in which coronal dentin showed higher SBS. The failure modes of all groups were mainly adhesive.", "Pretreatments with Ozone or Nd:YAG laser did not impair the SBS of both of the self-etch adhesives used to coronal and root dentin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Department of Conservative Dentistry, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. sgurgan@hacettepe.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurgan", "ForeName": "Sevil", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Firat", "ForeName": "Esra", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baysan", "ForeName": "Aylin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gutknecht", "ForeName": "Norbert", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imazato", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photomed Laser Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101222340", "ISSNLinking": "1549-5418"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Clearfil Bonding Agent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Clearfil Tri-S Bond"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dental Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resin Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Materials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lasers, Solid-State"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Resin Cements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Crown"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Root"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20932187", "10.1089/pho.2009.2608"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
