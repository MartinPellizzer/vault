In this study, the role of the gut-liver axis and the potential mechanism behind the metabolic disorder were investigated by histological examination, microbiome and metabolome approaches in mice during the subacute (4-week) and subchronic (12-week) exposure to 0.5\u00a0ppm and 2.5\u00a0ppm ozone. Ozone exposure resulted in slowed weight gain and reduced hepatic lipid contents in a dose-dependent manner. After exposure to ozone, the number of intestinal goblet cells decreased, while the number of tuft cells increased. Tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was significantly downregulated, and the apoptosis of epithelial cells increased with compensatory proliferation, indicating a compromised chemical and physical layer of the intestinal barrier. The hepatic and cecal metabolic profiles were altered, primarily related to lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. The abundance of Muribaculaceae increased dose-dependently in both colon and cecum, and was associated with the decrease of metabolites such as bile acids, betaine, and L-carnitine, which subsequently disrupted the intestinal barrier and lipid metabolism. Overall, this study found that subacute and subchronic exposure to ozone induced metabolic disorder via disturbing the gut-liver axis, especially the intestinal barrier. These findings provide new mechanistic understanding of the health risks associated with environmental ozone exposure and other oxidative stressors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
