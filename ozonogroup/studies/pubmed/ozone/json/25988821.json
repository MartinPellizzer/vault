We demonstrate that the reaction between the anion of PMS (i.e.,SO52\u2212) and O3 is primarily responsible for driving O3 consumption with a measured second order rate constant of (2.12 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). The formation of both \u2022OH and SO4\u2022\u2212 from the reaction between SO52\u2212 and O3 is confirmed by chemical probes (i.e., nitrobenzene for \u2022OH and atrazine forb oth \u2022OH and SO4\u2022\u2212). The yields of \u2022OH and SO4\u2022\u2212 are determined to be 0.43 \u00b1 0.1 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.1 per mol of O3 consumption, respectively. An adduct,\u2212O3SOO\u2212 + O3 \u2192 \u2212O3SO5\u2212, is assumed as the first step, which further decomposes into SO5\u2022\u2212 and O3\u2022\u2212. The subsequent reaction of SO5\u2022\u2212 with O3is proposed to generate SO4\u2022\u2212, while O3\u2022\u2212 converts to \u2022OH. A definition of R(ct,\u2022OH) and R(ct,SO4\u2022\u2212) (i.e., respective ratios of \u2022OH and SO4\u2022\u2212 exposures to O3 exposure) is adopted to quantify relative contributions of \u2022OH and SO4\u2022\u2212. Increasing pH leads to increases in both values of R(ct,\u2022OH) and R(ct,SO4\u2022\u2212) but does not significantly affect the ratio of R(ct,SO4\u2022\u2212) to R(ct,\u2022OH) (i.e., R(ct,SO4\u2022\u2212)/R(ct,\u2022OH)), which represents the relative formation of SO4\u2022\u2212 to \u2022OH. The presence of bicarbonate appreciably inhibits the degradation of probes and fairly decreases the relative contribution of \u2022OH for their degradation, which may be attributed to the conversion of both \u2022OH and SO4\u2022\u2212 to the more selective carbonate radical (CO3\u2022\u2212).Humic acid promotes O3 consumption to generate \u2022OH and thus leads to an increase in the R(ct,\u2022OH) value in the O3/PMS process,w hile humic acid has negligible influence on the R(ct,SO4\u2022\u2212) value. This discrepancy is reasonably explained by the negligible effect of humic acid on SO4\u2022\u2212 formation and a lower rate constant for the reaction of humic acid with SO4\u2022\u2212 than with \u2022OH. In addition, the efficacy of the O3/PMS process in real water is also confirmed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xinglin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yongze", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfate radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22047-43-4", "NameOfSubstance": "peroxymonosulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJA9M5H4IM", "NameOfSubstance": "Atrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atrazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Quality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25988821", "10.1021/es506362e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
