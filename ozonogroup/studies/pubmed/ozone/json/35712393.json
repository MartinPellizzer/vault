In experimental group, 5\u00a0ml (milliliter) blood obtained from the ear vein of each rabbit was ozonized by 80\u00a0\u00b5l (\u00b5l)/ml concentration ozone-oxygen mixture. Graft material was combined with this ozonized blood. In control group, the graft was combined with saline solution at 0.9% concentration. A 5\u00a0mm (millimeter) in diameter window was created on right maxillary sinus window in each rabbit under general anesthesia by local anesthesia support. Sinus membrane was elevated and the space was augmented by 1\u00a0cc (cubic centimeter) graft material. One rabbit from the control group which was planned to sacrifice at the end of 8\u00a0weeks could not participate in the evaluation because of the extensive inflammation at the operation site. Newly formed bone area and bone density were measured using by image analysis program. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and collagen-1 (COL-1) analyses were carried out immunohistochemically. The amount of the newly generated bone and the amount of the total augmented space were calculated volumetrically by microtomography.", "According to histomorphometrical analysis, although newly formed bone area has increased in both experimental and control group with time, statistically significant results were obtained when only O-8 (ozone-treated experimental group planned to be sacrificed after 8\u00a0weeks) and O-4 (ozone-treated experimental group planned to be sacrificed after 4\u00a0weeks) groups were compared (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,037). The increase in new bone density was seen in both experimental and control groups with time and the results were statistically significant when O-8 group compared to O-4 and C-4 group (ozone-free control group planned to be sacrificed after 4\u00a0weeks) (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,07 and <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,04, respectively) and C-8 (ozone-free control group planned to be sacrificed after 8\u00a0weeks) group compared to C-4 group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,023). According to immunohistochemical analysis, the intensity and the severity of field staining with anti-BMP-2 have increased in experimental group whereas it has decreased in control group but despite that there was no statistically significance among all groups compared to each other. The number of new vessels stained with anti-VEGF has increased in both experimental and control group with time and multiple comparison results were statistically significant when O-8 group compared with O-4 and C-4 (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,000, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,000, respectively), O-4 group compared with C-8 (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,000) and C-8 group compared with C-4 (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090,000). Although the intensity and the severity of field staining with anti-COL-1 have increased in both experimental and control group with time, there was no statistically significance among all groups compared to each other. According to microtomographical analysis, the percentage of the volume of the newly generated bone in the total augmented space volume has decreased with time in both experimental and control groups.", "Considering the results of this study, the graft material combined with the ozonized blood increased the density of the newly generated bone and the number of new vessels in maxillary sinus lifting applications in rabbits.", "We suggest further studies should be done combining the graft with ozone by different methods, dosages and exposure times."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons of India 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5550-9136"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.7256.6", "0000000109409118"], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Diyarbak\u0131r Oral and Dental Health Center, \u00dc\u00c7KUYULAR, Talaytepe Mahallesi Lale\u015f Sokak, 21070 Kayap\u0131nar/Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ar\u0131c\u0131", "ForeName": "Gamze", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "G\u00fclhane Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical Sciences University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u015een\u00e7imen", "ForeName": "Metin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "G\u00fclhane Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical Sciences University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Co\u015fkun", "ForeName": "Abdullah Tu\u011frul", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "G\u00fclhane Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical Sciences University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Altu\u011f", "ForeName": "Hasan Ayberk", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.413791.9", "0000 0004 0642 7670"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Medical Sciences University, Numune Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcre\u015fci", "ForeName": "Servet", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.14442.37", "0000 0001 2342 7339"], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7elik", "ForeName": "Hakan Hamdi", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.16487.3c", "0000 0000 9216 0511"], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Kafkas University, Kars, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Uzuner", "ForeName": "Muhammet Bora", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.14442.37", "0000 0001 2342 7339"], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ocak", "ForeName": "Mert", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Maxillofac Oral Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101538309", "ISSNLinking": "0972-8270"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestAuthor Gamze ARICI declares that she has no conflict of interest.
