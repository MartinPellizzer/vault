Temperature, precipitation and air pollutants may contribute to symptoms and distractions that increase risk or avoidance behavior that reduces risk. This study examines data that allows estimates of the relation of daily maximum temperature, precipitation and ozone pollution to injury mortality risk, each corrected statistically for the correlation with the others.", "Daily data on unintentional injury deaths and exposures to temperature, precipitation and ozone in 9 cities in Jiangsu Province, China during 2015-2017 were analyzed using Poisson regression. The regression estimates were adjusted for weekends, holidays, an anomalous difference in death rates in Nanjing, and population size.", "Non transport injury death risk increased substantially in relation to higher temperatures when temperatures were in the moderate range and even more so at temperatures 35 degrees (C) and higher. Transport deaths were related to increasing deaths when temperatures were low but the correlation reversed at higher temperatures. Deaths were lower on rainy days when temperatures were cool and moderate with the exception of non-transport injuries when temperatures were moderate. Higher ozone concentrations were associated with more deaths except when temperatures were low.", "The variations in deaths in relation to temperature, precipitation and ozone suggest that people are behaving differently or are in different environments when specific combinations of the predictor variables are prevalent, putting them at greater or less risk. More study of the behaviors and circumstances that result in injury under those conditions is needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1206-4496"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yale University School of Public Health, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT, 06520-8034, USA. leon.robertson@yale.edu."}], "LastName": "Robertson", "ForeName": "Leon S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control, 172 Jiangsu Road, Nanjing, 21009, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Lian", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yale Center on Climate Change and Health, Yale University School of Public Health, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT, 06520-8034, USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inj Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101652639", "ISSNLinking": "2197-1714"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have no financial or other interests that would be altered by publication of this study."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Basagana X.
