Our aim was to explore the relationship between daily average ozone levels and compensated acute respiratory problems among workers in Quebec between 2003 and 2010 using a time-stratified case-crossover design. Health data came from the Workers' Compensation Board. Daily concentrations of ozone were estimated using a spatiotemporal model. Conditional logistic regressions, with and without adjustment for temperature, were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs, per 1 ppb increase of ozone), and lag effects were assessed. Relationships with respiratory compensations in all industrial sectors were essentially null. Positive non-statistically significant associations were observed for outdoor sectors, and decreased after controlling for temperature (ORs of 0.98; 1.01 and 1.05 at Lags 0, 1 and 2 respectively). Considering the predicted increase of air pollutant concentrations in the context of climate change, closer investigation should be carried out on outdoor workers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Canada."}], "LastName": "Adam-Poupart", "ForeName": "Ariane", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Labr\u00e8che", "ForeName": "France", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Busque", "ForeName": "Marc-Antoine", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brand", "ForeName": "Allan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duguay", "ForeName": "Patrice", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fournier", "ForeName": "Michel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zayed", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smargiassi", "ForeName": "Audrey", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "2985065R", "ISSNLinking": "0019-8366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Extraction and Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Quebec"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Seguin J.
