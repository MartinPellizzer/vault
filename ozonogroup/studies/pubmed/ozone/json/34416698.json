The assistance of ozone has enabled efficient VOCs removal at low temperature. Thereby, catalytic ozonation is considered as one of the most feasible and effective methods for VOCs elimination. This work systematically reviews the emerging advances of catalytic ozonation of different VOCs (i.e., aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated VOCs, chlorinated VOCs, sulfur-containing VOCs, and saturated alkanes) over various functional catalysts. General reaction mechanism of catalytic ozonation including both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Mars-van-Krevelen mechanisms was proposed depending on the reactive oxygen species involving the reactions. The influence of reaction conditions (water vapor and temperature) is fully discussed. This review also introduces the enhanced VOCs oxidation via catalytic ozonation in the ozone-generating systems including plasma and vacuum ultraviolet. Lastly, the existing challenges of VOCs catalytic ozonation are presented, and the perspective of this technology is envisioned."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
