The most stable structure was determined using density functional theory and synthesized, demonstrating thermal stability up to 375 \u00b0C. We fabricated indium oxide thin-film transistors (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>TFTs) prepared with DBADMI precursor using ALD in wide range of window processing temperature of 200 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, and 350 \u00b0C with an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) as the source. The growth per cycle of ALD ranged from 0.06 to 0.1 nm cycle<sup>-1</sup>at different deposition temperatures. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were employed to analyze the crystalline structure as it relates to the deposition temperature. At a relatively low deposition temperature of 200 \u00b0C, an amorphous morphology was observed, while at 300 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C, crystalline structures were evident. Additionally, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was conducted to identify the In-O and OH-related products in the film. The OH-related product was found to be as low as 1% with an increase the deposition temperature. Furthermore, we evaluated In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>TFTs and observed an increase in field-effect mobility, with minimal change in the threshold voltage (<i>V</i><sub>th</sub>), at 200 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, and 350 \u00b0C. Consequently, the DBADMI precursor, given its stability at highdeposition temperatures, is ideal for producing high-quality films and stable crystalline phases, with wide processing temperature range makeing it suitable for various applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3199-6878"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reality Devices Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Semiconductor and Advanced Device Engineering, ICT, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ju-Hun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reality Devices Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Seung-Youl", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TF Material Dev.Team, Soulbrain Co., Ltd, Gongju-city 3598, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yeon", "ForeName": "Changbong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reality Devices Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jong-Heon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TF Material Dev.Team, Soulbrain Co., Ltd, Gongju-city 3598, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jaesun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TF Material Dev.Team, Soulbrain Co., Ltd, Gongju-city 3598, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Kok Chew", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Analysis & Data Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and van der Waals Materials Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kitae", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and van der Waals Materials Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Yeonjin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6589-7045"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Analysis & Data Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Nano & Information Technology, KIST School, University of Science and Technology (UST), Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Soohyung", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reality Devices Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Chi-Sun", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8625-6562"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reality Devices Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Semiconductor and Advanced Device Engineering, ICT, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "Jaehyun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38876085", "10.1088/1361-6528/ad5848"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
