Buffer systems based on carbonate, sulfate, oxalate and citrate as the eluting species have been used. Among these, citrate proved to be the most versatile eluent allowing the separation of anions with absolute detection limits between 0.4 and 0.7 ng and of organic acids with detection limits between 0.4 and 4 ng in the non-suppressed mode. In the suppressed eluent mode iodate, bromate and chlorate could be separated using sodium carbonate as the mobile phase resulting in detection limits of 50 pg. The method was applied to the analysis of water samples containing oxyhalides originating from ozonization. Additionally, organic acids were separated by chromatographic separation techniques like reversed-phase, ion-pair or ion-exclusion chromatography and the compatibility with mass spectrometry was investigated with special respect to sensitivity of this detection mode."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Linz, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahrer", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buchberger", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10497946", "10.1016/s0021-9673(99)00396-9", "S0021-9673(99)00396-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
