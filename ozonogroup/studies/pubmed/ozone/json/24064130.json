The OVA exposure group was sensitized and challenged with OVA to establish an asthma model; the normal control group inhaled aerosolized saline; the ozone exposure group inhaled low-concentration ozone; the OVA+ozone exposure group inhaled low-concentration ozone before being challenged with aerosolized OVA every day. The percentage of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp(3+) regulatory T cells in CD4(+) T cells was determined by flow cytometry. The levels of interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) in peripheral blood and lung tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of Foxp3 in lung tissue was measured by PCR.", "The percentages of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp(3+) regulatory T cells in OVA exposure group (6.12\u00b11.03%) and ozone exposure group (5.87\u00b11.26%) were significantly lower than that in normal control group (9.85\u00b11.34%), and the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp(3+) regulatory T cells in OVA+ozone exposure group (3.31\u00b10.85%) was significantly lower than those in normal control group and OVA exposure group (P < 0.01). The levels of IL-4 in plasma and lung tissue in OVA exposure group (plasma: 21.83\u00b15.12 ng/L; lung tissue: 0.89\u00b10.13 ng/L) were significantly higher than those in normal control group (plasma: 10.58\u00b12.73 ng/L; lung tissue: 0.32\u00b10.11 ng/L) (P < 0.01). The levels of IL-4 in plasma and lung tissue in OVA+ozone exposure group (plasma: 35.47\u00b17.24 ng/L; lung tissue: 1.50\u00b10.42 ng/L) were significantly higher than those in normal control group and OVA exposure group (P < 0.01).
