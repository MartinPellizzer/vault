NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was loaded onto the surface of CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to create a composite catalyst (10%NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub>). The integration of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> onto CeO<sub>2</sub> enhanced the interaction between the catalyst and toluene, a representative VOC, resulting in significantly increased toluene adsorption without a corresponding increase in specific surface area. This integration also improved the utilization of charge carriers and conversion of ozone to O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. Under visible light irradiation, H<sub>2</sub>O accumulated charge carriers at 10%NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub>'s surface, facilitating both ozone utilization and toluene adsorption. Another benefit of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> loading was its ability to enhance the conversion efficiency of solar energy. Consequently, the toluene removal and mineralization efficiencies of 10%NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> were enhanced by 182% and 309% compared to CeO<sub>2</sub>, and by 201% and 357% compared to NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrated a novel co-catalyst design strategy for enhancing the photo-ozone catalytic degradation of VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
