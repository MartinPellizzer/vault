Ozone data from sites in the eastern United States are presented and several indices are used to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of ozone concentration and exposure. These indices are SUM06, W126, the 8-hour rolling average (MAX<sub>8hr</sub>>80), and the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. Ozone indices were selected to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution of ozone, and the sensitivity of this distribution to different representations of concentration or exposure. CASTNet is unique in that a uniform set of site selection criteria and uniform procedures, including traceability to a single primary standard, provide a high degree of comparability across sites. Sites were selected to avoid undue influence from point sources, area sources, or local activities. The sites reflect a wide range of land use and terrain types including agricultural and forested, in flat, rolling, and complex terrain from the eastern seaboard across the Appalachian Mountains to the Midwest. Results indicate that ozone concentrations varied greatly in time and space across the eastern United States. Sites in the upper northeast, upper midwest, and southern periphery subregions experienced relatively low ozone during the years of record compared to sites in the northeast, midwest, and south central subregions. Ozone exposures at an individual rural site are dependent on many factors, including terrain, meteorology, and distance from sources of precursors. Relative to the current (as of 1996) NAAQS, only a handful of CASTNet sites near major urban areas report exceedances. In contrast, the majority of CASTNet sites might exceed the proposed new primary standard for ozone. Sites at high elevation (>900m) in the east exhibit relatively high exposure statistics (e.g., SUM06 and W126), but no exceedance of the current ozone standard from 1988 through 1995. Terrain effects explain some of the variability within subregions and are an important consideration in the design of monitoring networks for ozone and possibly other pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baumgardner", "ForeName": "Ralph E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Science & Engineering, Inc. , Durham , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edgerton", "ForeName": "Eric S", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28060679", "10.1080/10473289.1998.10463722"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
