Twenty minutes of ozonation at a rate of 1,500 mg/L-h was observed to remove COD by 38%, whereas a COD removal efficiency of 40% was achieved via H2O2 enhanced ozonation (same conditions + 31.25 mM H2O2). Both of the pretreatment alternatives were monitored to elevate the BOD5/COD ratio from 0.01 to 0.08. The initially inert COD was reduced by 38% using ozonation and by 60% employing H2O2 enhanced ozonation. In terms of the lowest achievable effluent COD levels after bio-treatment, ozonation was observed to yield a residual COD of 205 mgL(-1), while a residual COD of 135 mgL(-1) was involved for perozonation. According to the results of acute toxicity on Phaedactylum tricornutum, ozonated and perozonated samples exhibited more toxicity than the untreated effluent after 4 days. The activated sludge inhibition test demonstrated that both of the pretreatment alternatives efficiently eliminated the inhibition of investigated formulation effluent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Istanbul Technical University, Civil Engineering Faculty, Environmental Engineering Department, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey. giskender@ins.itu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iskender", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sezer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arslan-Alaton", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Germirli Babuna", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okay", "ForeName": "O S", "Initials": "OS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IHS69L0Y4T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cefazolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cefazolin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diatoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17564388", "10.2166/wst.2007.325"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
