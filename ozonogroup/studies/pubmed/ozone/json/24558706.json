Accurate measurements of PM2.5 can be used to assess the impact of air pollution levels on human health and the environment and to validate air pollution models. The area under study is California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV) that has a history of poor particulate air quality. Attempts to use simple linear regressions to estimate PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) have not yielded good results. The period of study for this project was from October 2004 to July 2008 for six sites in the SJV. A simple linear regression between surface-measured PM2.5 and satellite-observed AOD (from MODIS [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer]) yields a correlation coefficient of about 0.17 in this region. The correlation coefficient between the measured PM2.5 and that retrieved combining satellite observations in a generalized additive model (GAM) resulted in an improved correlation coefficient of 0.77. The model used combinations of MODIS AOD, OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) AOD, NO2 concentration, and a seasonal variable as parameters. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the PM2.5 retrieved using the GAM captures many of the PM2.5 exceedances that were not seen in the simple linear regression model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.
