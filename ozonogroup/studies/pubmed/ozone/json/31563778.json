We included 1330 10-year-old and 1591 15-year-old participants. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were available for both age groups while interleukin (IL)-6 was measured at 10 years only. Maximum 8-h averages of ozone and daily average concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and PM with an aerodynamic diameter <10\u202f\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) were adopted from two background monitoring stations 0 (same day), 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days prior to the FeNO measurement or blood sampling. To assess associations, we utilized linear regression models for FeNO, and logistic regressions for IL-6 and hs-CRP, adjusting for potential covariates and co-pollutants NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>.", "We found that short-term ozone exposure was robustly associated with higher FeNO in adolescents at age 15, but not at age 10. No consistent associations were observed between ozone and IL-6 in children aged 10 years. The relationship between hs-CRP levels and ozone was J-shaped. Relatively low ozone concentrations (e.g., <120\u202f\u03bcg/m\u00b3) were associated with reduced hs-CRP levels, while high concentrations (e.g., \u2265120\u202f\u03bcg/m\u00b3) tended to be associated with elevated levels for both 10- and 15-year-old participants.", "Our study demonstrates significant associations between short-term ozone exposure and FeNO at 15 years of age and a J-shaped relationship between ozone and hs-CRP. The finding indicates that high ozone exposure may favor inflammatory responses in adolescents, especially regarding airway inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
