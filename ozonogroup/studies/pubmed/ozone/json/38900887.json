This has challenged conventional understanding of the sources of their volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors. Using airborne flux measurements to map emissions of a wide range of VOCs, we demonstrate that biogenic terpenoid emissions contribute ~60% of emitted VOC OH reactivity, ozone, and secondary organic aerosol formation potential in summertime Los Angeles and that this contribution strongly increases with temperature. This implies that control of nitrogen oxides is key to reducing ozone formation in Los Angeles. We also show some anthropogenic VOC emissions increase with temperature, which is an effect not represented in current inventories. Air pollution mitigation efforts must consider that climate warming will strongly change emission amounts and composition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7715-1200"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Pfannerstill", "ForeName": "Eva Y", "Initials": "EY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0170-8794"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Arata", "ForeName": "Caleb", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2173-4014"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Qindan", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6405-8872"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Schulze", "ForeName": "Benjamin C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2317-3310"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "Ryan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Woods", "ForeName": "Roy", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5692-3427"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Meteorology, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Harkins", "ForeName": "Colin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7095-3718"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Meteorology, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Schwantes", "ForeName": "Rebecca H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1344-4068"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "LastName": "Seinfeld", "ForeName": "John H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7049-4005"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Bucholtz", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6617-7691"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Cohen", "ForeName": "Ronald C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4014-4896"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Science. 2024 Jun 21;384(6702):1299. doi: 10.1126/science.adq1423", "PMID": "38900898"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38900887", "10.1126/science.adg8204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
