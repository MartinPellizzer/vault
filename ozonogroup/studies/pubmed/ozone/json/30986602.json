The physicochemical properties of the prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and zeta potential. Comprehensive investigation has proven the process to be efficient in the removal of CIP with high yield of reactive species (OH, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, h<sup>+</sup>, etc.). Kinetic model on pH investigation found out a repulsive force between the photocatalysts and CIP intensified with the increasing pH, so did the production rate of hydroxyl radicals (OH), while eventually reached a balance and achieved a maximum degradation rate. The results indicated that the enhancement mechanism was triggered by the photoexcited electron accumulated on CDs and transferred by ozone, resulting in the continuous generation of h+, O<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. Possible photocatalytic ozonation degradation pathways of CIP were proposed according to the identifications of intermediates using high-resolution accurate-mass spectrometry (HRAM) LC-MS/MS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
