Three varieties of sweet potato were exposed to ozone treatments (peaks of: 30 (Low), 80 (Medium), and 110 (High) ppb) using heated solardomes. Weekly measurements of stomatal conductance (gs) and chlorophyll content (CI) were used to determine physiological responses, along with final yield. gs and CI were reduced with increasing ozone exposure, but effects were partially masked due to elevated leaf senescence and turnover. Yield for the Erato orange and Murasaki varieties was reduced by \u223c40% and \u223c50% (Medium and High ozone treatments, respectively, vs Low) whereas Beauregard yield was reduced by 58% in both. The DO<sub>3</sub>SE (Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange) model was parameterized for gs in response to light, temperature, vapour pressure deficit and soil water potential. Clear responses of gs to the environmental parameters were found. Yield reductions were correlated with both concentration based AOT40 (accumulated ozone above a threshold of 40\u00a0ppb) and flux based POD<sub>6</sub> (accumulated stomatal flux of ozone above a threshold of 6\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>- 2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>- 1</sup>) metrics (R<sup>2</sup> 0.66 p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; and R<sup>2</sup> 0.44 p\u00a0=\u00a00.05, respectively). A critical level estimate of a POD<sub>6</sub> of 3 (mmol m<sup>-2</sup> Projected Leaf Area<sup>-1</sup>) was obtained using the relationship. This study showed that sweet potato yield was reduced by ozone pollution, and that stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content were also affected. Results from this study can improve model predictions of ozone impacts on sweet potato together with associated ozone risk assessments for tropical countries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
