While fixed-site monitoring (FSM) stations are commonly used in air pollutant exposure studies, they may not fully capture personal exposures due to limitations such as inadequate consideration of daily routines and indoor/outdoor concentration variations. In this study, to enhance the accuracy of personal exposure calculated by using FSM data, individual's daily activity routine, encompassing both indoor and outdoor environments, were incorporated by using indoor-to-outdoor concentration ratios. Three methodologies were compared to assess the accuracy of exposure calculations: (i) direct exposure determination employing passive samplers (PS), (ii) personal exposure calculated using FSM data alone, and (iii) personal exposure calculated using FSM data refined by integrating local average individual daily activity routines and indoor-to-outdoor ratios. The results demonstrate that the refined method (iii) yields substantial improvements in estimated exposure levels, reducing the average error from 1.4% to 0.4% for NO<sub>2</sub>, from 72.1% to 12.7% for SO<sub>2</sub>, and from 323.4% to 24.9% for O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
