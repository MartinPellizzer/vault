Ozone is not a medicine, so the word therapy does not properly fit this gaseous molecule. Like many natural compounds, for example plant flavonoids, even ozone interacts with aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) and, at low doses, it works according to the paradoxical mechanism of hormesis, involving mitochondria (mitohormesis). Ozone, in the hormetic range, exerts cell protective functions via the Nrf2-mediated activation of the anti-oxidant system, then leading to anti-inflammatory effects, also via the triggering of low doses of 4-HNE. Moreover, its interaction with plasma and lipids forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipoperoxides (LPOs), generally called ozonides, which are enabled to rule the major molecular actions of ozone in the cell. Ozone behaves as a bioregulator, by activating a wide population of reactive intermediates, which usually target mitochondria and their turnover/biogenesis, often leading to a pleiotropic spectrum of actions and behaving as a tuner of the fundamental mechanisms of survival in the cell. In this sense, ozone can be considered a novelty in the medical sciences and in the clinical approach to pharmacology and medical therapy, due to its ability to target complex regulatory systems and not simple receptors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1789-8307"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["19051"], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering for Innovation Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy."}], "LastName": "Chirumbolo", "ForeName": "Salvatore", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tirelli Medical Group, Pordenone, Italy."}], "LastName": "Tirelli", "ForeName": "Umberto", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["19001"], "Affiliation": "Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy (SIOOT) and High Master School in Oxygen Ozone Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Franzini", "ForeName": "Marianno", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["19001"], "Affiliation": "Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy (SIOOT) and High Master School in Oxygen Ozone Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pandolfi", "ForeName": "Sergio", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["19001"], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Science, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ricevuti", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["19001"], "Affiliation": "Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy (SIOOT) and High Master School in Oxygen Ozone Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Vaiano", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["19001"], "Affiliation": "Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy (SIOOT) and High Master School in Oxygen Ozone Therapy, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Valdenassi", "ForeName": "Luigi", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hormesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Personality"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38073286", "10.1177/09603271231218926"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
