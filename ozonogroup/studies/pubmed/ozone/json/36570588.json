The duration of this study was 15\u00a0days and was divided into three groups. Group 1 patients were advised to rinse with ozonated water\u00b8 group 2 with a chlorhexidine mouth rinse and group 3 with water for 15\u00a0days. The clinical parameters like plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding index were recorded at baseline, 7th, and 15th day respectively. Saliva samples were collected for microbial culture at baseline that is before mouth rinse and on the 15th day that is after using mouth rinse from each patient.", "The statistical analysis was performed by using ANOVA and Bonferroni's Post Hoc test on 30 patients at the end of the 15<sup>th</sup>day. There was a significant decrease in mean plaque, gingival, and bleeding scores in group 2 patients that are chlorhexidine mouth rinse. There was also a decrease in the microbial culture at the end of the 15th day in patients with chlorhexidine mouth rinse compared to ozonated water.", "The results of this study demonstrate that ozonated water was less effective compared to chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing plaque in gingivitis patients.
