Commercial zeolite ZSM-5 with specific surface area of 400\u2005m<sup>2</sup>/g and diameter particle of 1.2-2\u2005mm was used as a parent support. The prepared catalysts were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. The IR absorbed bands of Cu-ZSM-5 and Fe-ZSM-5 revealed a shift in the frequency and a reduction in the intensity framework. This indicates that both catalysts have a significant change in the number of the zeolite structure bonds. The catalytic activity of the prepared materials compared to the parent zeolite was evaluated for the catalytic ozone decomposition. The ozone stream of the initial concentration (13\u2005g/m<sup>3</sup>) with air flow rate (Q) of 0.18\u2005m<sup>3</sup>/h was passed through a glass jacket column reactor filled with a fixed bed of 40\u2005g zeolites. It was showed that the ozone removal efficiency by Cu-ZSM-5 and Fe-ZSM-5 was obviously higher than that found with the parent ZSM-5. In terms of O<sub>3</sub> removal efficiency, zeolite samples could be ranked as follows: Fe-ZSM-5\u2009>\u2009Cu-ZSM-5>\u00a0parent ZSM-5. The results revealed about 90% O<sub>3</sub> removal efficiency for Fe-ZSM-5 and 70% for Cu-ZSM-5 as compared to nearly 40% for the parent zeolite. Consequently, the incorporation of Fe and Cu metals onto the zeolite surface plays a key role for enhancing the gaseous ozone elimination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Air Pollution Department, Division of Environmental Research , National Research Centre , Giza , Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "E F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products Department, Division of Pharmaceutical Industries , National Research Centre , Giza , Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Awad", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Laboratoire de Chimie de la Mati\u00e8re Condens\u00e9e, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences et Techniques , Universit\u00e9 Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah , F\u00e8s , Maroc."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaitan", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, INPT, UPS, Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Chimique, 4 , Toulouse , France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andriantsiferana", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, INPT, UPS, Laboratoire de G\u00e9nie Chimique, 4 , Toulouse , France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manero", "ForeName": "M-H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28368211", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1315457"]}}]}
