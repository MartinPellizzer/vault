While bimetallic catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity compared with conventional single noble metal catalysts, limited success has been achieved in the influence of the bimetallic effect on the stability and ozone utilization of metal catalysts. Herein, it is necessary to systematically study the enhancement effect in the ozone catalytic reaction induced by the second metal. With a simple continuous impregnation method, a platinum-cerium bimetallic catalyst is prepared. Also highlighted are studies from several aspects of the contribution of the second metal (Ce) to the stability and ozone utilization of the catalysts, including the \"electronic effect\" and \"geometric effect\". The synergistic removal rate of toluene and ozone is nearly 100% at 30 \u00b0C, and it still shows positive stability after high humidity and a long reaction time. More importantly, the instructive significance, which is the in-depth knowledge of enhanced catalytic mechanism of bimetallic catalysts resulting from a second metal, is provided by this work."]},
