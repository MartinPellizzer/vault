Significant population and family effects were found for seedling height, lamina width, and leaf damage. The exposure to UV-B radiation decreased genetic variation at the stage of seed germination. Complex exposure to UV-B and O(3) caused an increase of genetic variation at the stage of intensive seedling growth: seedling height genetic variation in separate treatments increased from 23.7-38.6 to 33.7-65.7%, the increase for lamina width was from 10.2-13.9 to 13.6-31.8%. Different populations and families demonstrated differing response to elevated complex UV-B and O(3) exposure. Changes of genetic intra-population variation were population-specific. Such changes in genetic variation under the impact of stressors can alter adaptation, stability, and competitive ability of regenerating populations in a hardly predictive way."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lithuanian Forest Research Institute, Department of Tree Genetics and Breeding, Liepu 1, Girionys LT-53101, Kaunas District, Lithuania. genetsk@mi.lt"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pliura", "ForeName": "Alfas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baliuckiene", "ForeName": "Asta", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baliuckas", "ForeName": "Virgilijus", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Betula"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18262319", "10.1016/j.envpol.2007.12.023", "S0269-7491(07)00606-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
