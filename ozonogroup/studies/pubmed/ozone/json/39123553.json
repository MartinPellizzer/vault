Currently, controlling enzyme activity and the microbial survival environment is a common approach to reducing the rate of deterioration in raw meat materials, thereby achieving the goal of bacteria reduction during storage and preservation. This review summarizes the commonly used technologies for reducing bacteria in meat, including slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW), organic acids, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), ultrasound, irradiation, ultraviolet (UV), cold plasma, high-pressure processing (HPP), and biological bacterial reduction agents. This review outlines the mechanisms and main features of these technologies for reducing bacteria in meat processing. Additionally, it discusses the status of these technologies in meat storage and preservation applications while analyzing associated problems and proposing solutions. The aim is to provide valuable references for research on meat preservation technology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meat Processing Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610106, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meat Processing Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610106, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Meat Processing Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610106, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jiamin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BaHang Food Development Co., Zigong 643030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Zhengguo", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SiChuan AiChiTu Food Co., Bazhong 636600, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Zhonghua", "Initials": "Z"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CARS-43", "Agency": "the Earmarked Fund for China Agricultural Industry Research System", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Foods", "NlmUniqueID": "101670569", "ISSNLinking": "2304-8158"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39123553", "10.3390/foods13152361", "foods13152361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
