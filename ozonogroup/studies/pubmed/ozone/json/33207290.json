The combination showed synergistic effects in degrading various organic contaminants (like diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, etc.). A small amount of O<sub>3</sub> (1\u00a0mg L<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>, 60\u00a0mL min<sup>-1</sup>) significantly improved the oxidation and mineralization ability of an electro-permanganate process by generating more reactive manganese species and hydroxyl radicals. The combination required less energy consumption than comparable processes. Mechanism experiments showed that the \u00b7OH involved was mainly generated by cathode reduction, homogeneous manganese catalysis, and heterogeneous manganese catalysis of O<sub>3</sub> decomposition. Reactive Mn species were generated by electro-reduction, \u00b7OH oxidation or/and O<sub>3</sub> activation. In situ generated Mn (\u2163)<sub>s</sub> plays a vital role in generating \u00b7OH and reactive Mn species. \u00b7OH generated by O<sub>3</sub> catalysis could transfer colloid Mn (\u2163)<sub>s</sub> to free Mn (\u2164)<sub>aq</sub> and Mn (\u2165) <sub>aq</sub>. And both the \u00b7OH and RMnS played the dominant role for DCF removal. Increasing permanganate dosage, O<sub>3</sub> concentration, the current density, Cl<sup>-</sup>, or humic acid, and decreasing the pH all enhanced the degradation of diclofenac, but the presence of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibited it. Supplementing electrolysis with permanganate and O<sub>3</sub> might be a practical, sustainable, and economical technology for treating refractory organics in natural waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
