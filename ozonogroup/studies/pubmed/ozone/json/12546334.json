Outdoor air concentrations of ozone, particulates of < 10 microm diameter (PM-10), pollens, and fungal spores were obtained from the Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services. Multiple regression analysis was performed, looking for relationships between the daily number of asthma visits and the air quality data for the same day and for 1 through 5 days before the visits.", "A significant association was found between the number of asthma visits and the daily pollen count (P = 0.014, SE = 0.001). The effect was stronger for visits 1, 2, and 3 days after the pollen count (P < 0.001 for pollen count lagged 3 days). High PM-10 counts were synergistic with the pollen count as a predictor of asthma visits. There was no association between asthma visits and the ozone concentration or fungal spore count.", "Exacerbations of asthma severe enough to require visits to the hospital were associated with elevated concentrations of airborne pollens and particulates, with a significant delayed effect. Ozone, in the concentrations measured here, was not a risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations in children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy and Immunology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA. michelle.lierl@chmcc.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lierl", "ForeName": "Michelle B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hornung", "ForeName": "Richard W", "Initials": "RW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2003 Jan;90(1):1-2. doi: 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63601-0", "PMID": "12546326"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Welfare"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Observer Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ohio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spores, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12546334", "10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63610-1", "S1081-1206(10)63610-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
