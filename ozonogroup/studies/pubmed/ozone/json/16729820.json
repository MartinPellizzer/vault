Though a number of hydrogen-bonded complexes have been described in the gas phase, both theoretically and experimentally, the structures of ozone and HO(x) in liquid water remain uncertain. In this work, combined quantum/classical computer simulations of aqueous solutions of these species have been reported. The results show that ozone undergoes noticeable electron polarization but it does not participate in hydrogen bonds with liquid water. The main contribution of the solvation energy comes from dispersion forces. In contrast, HO(x) radicals form strong hydrogen bonds. They are better proton donors but weaker proton acceptors than water. Their electronic and geometrical structures are significantly modified by the solvent, especially in the case of HO(3). In all cases, fluctuations in amplitudes of electronic properties are considerable, suggesting that solvent effects might play a crucial role on oxidation mechanisms initiated by ozone in liquid water. These mechanisms are important in a broad range of domains, such as atmospheric processes, plant response to ambient ozone, and medical and industrial applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Equipe de Chimie et Biochimie Th\u00e9oriques, UMR CNRS-UHP No. 7565, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Nancy I, BP 239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy Cedex, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chalmet", "ForeName": "St\u00e9phanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruiz-L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "Manuel F", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16729820", "10.1063/1.2198818"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
