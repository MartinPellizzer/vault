One half of the trees were grown on an acidic sandy soil, the other half on a calcareous soil rich in carbonate. At the end of the fumigation period, carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose, starch, glucose-1-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate) and parameters of the energy status (ATP-, AdN-(ATP + ADP + AMP)- levels, ATP/ADP-ratios and adenylate-energy-charge-(AEC)-values) were determined in the current-year's needles. The results indicate that the metabolic status of a plant tissue is not only influenced by the nature of the air pollutants. Soil factors play an important role in metabolic changes within the plant and are thus of relevance in the manifestation of damage symptoms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Botanik und Mikrobiologie, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Archisstrabetae 21, 8000 Munich 2, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magel", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00f6ll", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziegler", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092289", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90055-h", "0269-7491(90)90055-H"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
