Scenarios feature contrasting levels of oil and gas production and shares of electricity from coal, natural gas, and renewables. Hourly emissions are resolved for individual power plants; oil and gas emissions are basin-specific. Ozone decreased from 2011 to the 2030 baseline, with median and 90th percentile reductions in maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone across the four-state domain of 3.5 and 7.1 ppb, respectively, resulting in 200 fewer premature deaths annually. Relative to the 2030 baseline, MDA8 ozone increased in the \"cheap gas\" scenario, with median and 90th percentile increases of 0.1 and 1.0 ppb, and declined in a scenario with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fees, with median and 90th percentile reductions of 0.2 and 1.5 ppb. Reduced coal generation lowered SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in all future scenarios compared to 2011. GHG emissions from electricity and oil and gas production declined by 4% (CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent) from 2011 to the 2030 baseline, increased by 10% from the 2030 baseline to the cheap gas scenario, and declined by 28% from the 2030 baseline to the GHG fees scenario."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder , Colorado 80309-0427 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8754-0186"], "LastName": "Nsanzineza", "ForeName": "Rene", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering , Drexel University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Capps", "ForeName": "Shannon L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder , Colorado 80309-0427 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milford", "ForeName": "Jana B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorado"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wyoming"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31180656", "10.1021/acs.est.9b00356"]}}]}
