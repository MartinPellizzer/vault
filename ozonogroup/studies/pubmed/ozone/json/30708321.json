As a major secondary air pollutant, ozone is a potential risk factor for exacerbated asthma, although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of ozone on asthma exacerbation using a classic asthmatic model with allergic airway inflammation by treating Balb/c mice with ovalbumin (OVA). Our study shows ozone exposure significantly exacerbated OVA-induced asthmatic phenotypes, including serum immunoglobulin, Th cytokines, inflammatory cell counts, mucus production, airway remodeling, and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Interestingly, expression of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member1 (TRPV1) was also significantly elevated in ozone-exacerbated asthmatic mice and that treatment with TRPV1 antagonist effectively suppressed AHR, airway inflammation and remodeling. The underlying mechanisms of these effects may be associated with suppression of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cell-derived cytokine. Base on the role of TRPV1 in allergic asthma, this study further revealed that inhibition of TRPV1 by TRPV1 antagonist has significant anti-inflammatory effects on ozone-induced asthma exacerbation in this study. Induction of TRPV1 expression may be an important mechanism underlying the increased risks for asthma after exposure to environmental pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
