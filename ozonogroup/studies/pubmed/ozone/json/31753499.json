However, in many developing countries, the community residents lack awareness of the benefits of classified collection, which leads to a lack of initiative to classify MSW. To make the people realize the importance of MSW classification and increase the classification dynamics, Suzhou, China was taken as an example in this study, and residential areas were selected as sampling sites for classified and mixed collection of domestic waste. The main components of the odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the dustbins via different disposal modes were determined by sampling in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In addition, the ozone formation potential (OFP) and human health risk assessment of the VOCs were analyzed. Halogenated compounds were the major pollutants from the household waste dustbins of the residential areas. However, aromatic compounds contributed the most to the OFP of the VOCs. The OFP of VOCs reached the highest peak in summer, which was 1.02\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, more attention needs to be paid in classifying waste to reduce the concentration of OFP. Although there was a carcinogenic risk in spring and summer, it declined after waste classification. Compared with mixed collection, the source-classified collection of garbage had advantages in terms of controlling the emission of VOCs, ozone formation potential, and human health risk. These results could provide the evidence demonstrating the advantages of waste classification and attract people's attention. Furthermore, the results can also provide impetus to those countries, where separate collection of waste has not yet been implemented, to improve the enthusiasm for classification and the integrity of waste classification system. Residents should be encouraged to classify household waste in residential areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
