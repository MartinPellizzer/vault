These calculations show that variations in POCP values are large between different types of chemical environments and that POCP values for VOCs should be presented as ranges instead of single values. POCP ranges are based on the extremes of the POCP values and are defined with the intention to include all POCP values an individual VOC will obtain in any European environment where O3 formation is of environmental concern. The POCP ranges indicate large differences in O3 production between individual VOCs, which justifies the use of this ranking scale instead of treating all VOCs as a homogeneous group of species in abatement strategies. Both the average O3 production over 96 hr and the maximum contribution to the O3 concentration were studied. The most efficient O3 producers were found to be isoprene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and acrolein. As a group, the alkenes are the most potent O3 producers, followed by higher alkanes and then the aromatics. The calculated values show a good agreement with previously calculated POCP values under northern European conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swedish Environmental Research Institute, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Altenstedt", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pleijel", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10902397", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
