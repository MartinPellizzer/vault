In the present study yield responses and kernel quality traits of two maize cultivars [DHM117: normal maize (NM)] and [HQPM1: quality protein maize (QPM)] are investigated. Cultivars were exposed to two doses of elevated O<sub>3</sub> , namely NFC\u00a0+\u00a015 and NFC\u00a0+\u00a030\u2009ppb O<sub>3</sub> above ambient level (NFC, non-filtered chambers) while filtered chambers served as control.", "Test weight (thousand kernel weight), weight of kernels per square meter and kernel starch content reduced more in NM than QPM due to elevated O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Total soluble and reducing sugars increased in both the cultivars being more in NM. Though, endosperm protein showed comparatively more increase in QPM than NM, decline in essential amino acids tryptophan and lysine was higher in QPM. Majority of nutrient elements increased after O<sub>3</sub> treatment, while reductions in oil content as well as saturated fatty acids were observed in both test cultivars. Of the two essential fatty acids, omega 3 fatty acid reduced while omega 6 fatty acid contents increased in QPM. Oil became more unsaturated (increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids) upon O<sub>3</sub> exposure, thus increasing its reactivity and hence became more prone to auto-oxidation.", "Elevated O<sub>3</sub> caused losses in yield of maize cultivars and NM showed higher sensitivity than QPM. Kernel quality analysis revealed significant changes in nutritional parameters. Carbohydrate content reduced more in NM, while essential amino acids and saturated fatty acids showed more decline in QPM. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Aditya-Abha", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0269-3800"], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Shashi B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shahi", "ForeName": "Jay P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "38 (1287)/11/EMR-II)", "Agency": "Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, Government of India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Essential"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Essential"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30315574", "10.1002/jsfa.9414"]}}]}
