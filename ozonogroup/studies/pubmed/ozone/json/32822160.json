This study, hence, is to explore whether an oxidative stress biomarker, malondialdehyde (MDA) in the nasal fluid, has the potential to aid personalized asthma control. In a panel study of 43 asthmatic children, 5-13 years old, each child was measured 4 times with a 2-week interval between consecutive clinic visits. At each visit, nasal fluid and urine samples were collected, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured as a biomarker of pulmonary inflammation. In addition to nasal MDA, urinary MDA and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured as biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress. We also assessed asthma symptoms using the Childhood Asthma-Control Test (C-ACT). We found that interquartile range (IQR) increases in 24 h average personal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure (22.2-33.5 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), estimated 0 to 5 days prior to a clinic visit, were associated with increased nasal MDA concentrations by 38.6-54.9%. Similarly, IQR increases in 24 h average personal O<sub>3</sub> exposure (7.7-8.2 ppb) estimated 2 to 4 days prior were associated with increased nasal MDA by 22.1-69.4%. Only increased PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with increased FeNO. Increased nasal MDA concentration was associated with decreased total and individual C-ACT scores, indicating worsening of asthma symptoms. However, no significant associations were observed between urinary MDA or 8-OHdG and C-ACT scores. The results confirm that oxidative stress plays an important role in linking air pollution exposure and adverse respiratory health effects. These findings support that MDA in the nasal fluid may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring asthma status, especially in relation to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposures, two known risk factors of asthma exacerbation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina
