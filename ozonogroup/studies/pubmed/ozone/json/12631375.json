The aim of the study was to compare the development of biofilm between a water treatment system based on a single reverse osmosis unit producing purified dialysate water [bacterial count, 350 colony-forming unit (CFU)/L] (center A) and a water treatment system based on double reverse osmosis and electric deionization, which is continuously disinfected with ultraviolet light and treated with ozone once a week (bacterial count, 1 CFU/L) (center B).", "During a period of 12 weeks, biofilm formation was studied in the tubing segment between the water piping and the dialysis module, using four dialysis monitors in each center. On a weekly basis, tubing samples of 5 cm length (N = 96) were taken under aseptic conditions and investigated for microbiologic contamination [cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient (CLED) Agar], endotoxin levels [limulus amoeben lysate (LAL) gel test, cutoff value, 0.0125 EU/mL], and biofilm formation [electron scanning microscopy (SEM)].", "In center A, tube cultures were positive (>100 CFU/mL) in 16% of samples at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C, compared to 3% of samples of center B (P < 0.05; chi-square). Endotoxin levels were positive in 76% of the tubing samples of center A and negative in all of the samples of center B (P < 0.05). Biofilm was present in 91.7% of the samples of center A (Fig. 1), and only present in one sample (taken after 9 weeks) of center B (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2). In center A, biofilm formation was already observed after 1 week.", "In contrast to a standard water treatment system producing purified water, the use of a system producing highly purified water, which is also treated with regular disinfection procedures, leads to a significant reduction in biofilm formation, bacterial growth, and endotoxin levels in a highly vulnerable part of a water treatment system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Maastricht, University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smeets", "ForeName": "Ed", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kooman", "ForeName": "Jeroen", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van der Sande", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stobberingh", "ForeName": "Ellen", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frederik", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Claessens", "ForeName": "Piet", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grave", "ForeName": "Willem", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schot", "ForeName": "Arend", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leunissen", "ForeName": "Karel", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Kidney Int", "NlmUniqueID": "0323470", "ISSNLinking": "0085-2538"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiological Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Renal Dialysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12631375", "10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00888.x", "S0085-2538(15)49037-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
