In this study, ozone-peroxymonosulfate (O<sub>3</sub>/PMS) oxidation process was employed to ameliorate sludge dewaterability. Sludge capillary suction time (CST) and water content (Wc) of dewatered sludge cake could reduce from 70.5\u00a0s and 81.93% to 26.7\u00a0s and 65.65%, respectively, under the optimal dosage of 30\u00a0mg/g TS O<sub>3</sub> and 0.4\u00a0mmol/g TS PMS. The increased sludge zeta potential, particle size, and fluidity promoted sludge dewatering performance apparently. The decreased hydrophilic, fluorescent EPS components and proteins/peptides-like\u00a0+\u00a0Lipids percentage in EPS as well as the ratio of \u03b1-helix/(\u03b2-sheet\u00a0+\u00a0random coil) of treated EPS protein secondary structure was greatly responsible for the enhanced sludge dewaterability. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and OH were detected in ozone-peroxymonosulfate process to crack sludge flocs, eliminate hydrophilic substances and liberate bound water. Moreover, the concentrations of both heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of sludge after O<sub>3</sub>/PMS conditioning were decreased, and the stability and toxicity of heavy metals were also reduced, except Zn. In conclusion, this work offered a comprehensive insight based on ozone-peroxymonosulfate (O<sub>3</sub>/PMS) advanced oxidation for improving the sludge dewaterability and environmental implication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
