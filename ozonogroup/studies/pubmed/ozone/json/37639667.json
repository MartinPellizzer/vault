When there are no indoor sources of ozone, a common condition, the net concentration of gaseous products derived from indoor ozone chemistry scales linearly with the difference between outdoor and indoor ozone concentrations, termed \"ozone loss.\" As such, ozone loss is a metric that might be used by epidemiologists to disentangle the adverse health effects of ozone's oxidation products from those of exposure to ozone itself. The present paper examines the characteristics, potential utility, and limitations of the ozone loss concept. We show that for commonly occurring indoor conditions, the ozone loss concentration is directly proportional to the total rate constant for ozone removal on surfaces (<i>k</i><sub>sum</sub>) and inversely proportional to the net removal of ozone by air exchange (\u03bb) plus surface reactions (<i>k</i><sub>sum</sub>). It follows that the ratio of indoor ozone to ozone loss is equal to the ratio of \u03bb to <i>k</i><sub>sum</sub>. Ozone loss is a promising metric for probing potential adverse health effects resulting from exposures to products of indoor ozone chemistry. Notwithstanding its virtues, practitioners using it should be mindful of the limitations discussed in this paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9097-5850"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby 2800, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Weschler", "ForeName": "Charles J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5645-3357"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-1710, United States."}], "LastName": "Nazaroff", "ForeName": "William W", "Initials": "WW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES005022", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37639667", "10.1021/acs.est.3c03968"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
