However, no simple and practical technology is available for degrading H<sub>2</sub>S in situ at tunnel constructing sites. On May 11, 2020, an H<sub>2</sub>S blowout accident occurred in underground soil at a residential sewer-tunnel construction site in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, filling the tunnel with high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S gas, causing the fatality of one worker owing to emphysema. River water flowing near the site was immediately introduced into the tunnel to trap the H<sub>2</sub>S gas, generating 652-m<sup>3</sup> water that contained high concentrations (120\u00a0mg/L) of dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S in the tunnel. To safely and quickly remove H<sub>2</sub>S in situ, the contaminated water was treated with high-density oxygen and ozone nanobubbles (O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>-HDNBs) generated using the ultrafine pore method. Consequently, H<sub>2</sub>S was removed from the contaminated water in 3 days. This is the first successful application of O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>-HDNB technology for the in situ oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>S in environmental water at a construction site. This study reports the practical application of this advanced technology and the system performance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
