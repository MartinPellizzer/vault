A cross-over design was chosen. The pain level was measured with a Visual Analogue Scale before and after the treatment.", "The subjects' pain level was reduced by 55% +/- 5.5% immediately after the ozone treatment. Over time, the pain level decreased significantly in all groups: The pain level in the test teeth was significantly reduced in Weeks 0-22 (treatment group, P < 0.001) compared to the pain level before treatment. The pain level in the control group was also reduced significantly over time in Weeks 0-22 (no-treatment, P = 0.025) and in Weeks 22-54 (treatment group, P = 0.0065). Comparing test and control teeth over time, there was no statistically significant difference in pain reduction (P = 0.58)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive, Restorative and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00e4hnhardt", "ForeName": "Jan Eric", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gygax", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martignoni", "ForeName": "Bernhard", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suter", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lussi", "ForeName": "Adrian", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "8806701", "ISSNLinking": "0894-8275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toothpastes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin Sensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Recession"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Pocket"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Toothpastes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18578171"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
