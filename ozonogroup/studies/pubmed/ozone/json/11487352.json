The rate constants increase by a factor of 5 x 10(6) as the nucleophilicities of the anions increase from Br(-) to SO(3)(2-). Ozone adducts with the nucleophiles are proposed as steady-state intermediates prior to oxygen atom transfer with release of O(2). Ab initio calculations show possible structures for the intermediates. The reaction between Br(-) and O(3) is accelerated by H(+) but exhibits a kinetic saturation effect as the acidity increases. The kinetics indicate formation of BrOOO(-) as a steady-state intermediate with an acid-assisted step to give BrOH and O(2). Temperature dependencies of the reactions of Br(-) and HSO(3)(-) with O(3) in acidic solutions are determined from 1 to 25 degrees C. These kinetics are important in studies of annual ozone depletion in the Arctic troposphere at polar sunrise."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1393, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schurter", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muller", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aloisio", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margerum", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11487352", "10.1021/ic000919j", "ic000919j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
