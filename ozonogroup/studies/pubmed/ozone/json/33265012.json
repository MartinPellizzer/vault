Where yellow phosphorus is considered to stimulate formation of the ecological ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from O<sub>2</sub>, the oxidation of insoluble NO into water-soluble NOx species by O<sub>3</sub>, and the red mud as a pH buffer can be used to maintain the pH of the absorption liquid in a range that better absorbs NOx. NO is finally converted into NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, whereas the yellow phosphorus is mainly PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. Single-factor influencing on the efficiency of denitration include the concentration of yellow phosphorus, reaction temperature, stirring intensity, gas flow rate, O<sub>2</sub> content, and red mud solid-liquid ratio were investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process parameters. It was indicated that the removal rate of NOx can reach 99.3% under the optimal conditions. Moreover, the possible denitration reaction mechanism was also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
