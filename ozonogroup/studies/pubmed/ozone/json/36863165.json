Two-way fixed effects panel regression models are used to estimate air pollution's impacts. A random forest analysis is conducted to assess the relative importance of independent variables.", "The results show that, on average, a 1% increase in fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration would cause the agricultural TFP to decline by 0.104% and 0.207%, respectively. Air pollution's adverse impact widely exists in various countries with different development levels, pollution degrees, and industrial structures. This study also finds that temperature has a moderating effect on the relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and agricultural TFP. PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution's detrimental impact is weaker (stronger) in a warmer (cooler) climate. In addition, the random forest analysis confirms that air pollution is among the most crucial predictors of agricultural productivity.", "Air pollution is a substantial threat to the improvement of global agricultural TFP. Worldwide actions should be taken to ameliorate air quality, for the sake of agricultural sustainability and global food security."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
