Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used (OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 3.7).", "We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less (4 tons CO2 equivalent) than the traditional international face-to-face conference (192 tons CO2 equivalent). The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a face-to-face conference lasting 2.5 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times. However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails. Notwithstanding this, there is a 98% reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually.", "While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional in-person paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Duane", "ForeName": "Brett", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College London Hospital, London, England, UK."}], "LastName": "Lyne", "ForeName": "Alexandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, USA."}], "LastName": "Faulkner", "ForeName": "Theresa", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Mazankowski Heart Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Windram", "ForeName": "Jonathan D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}], "LastName": "Redington", "ForeName": "Andrew N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Saget", "ForeName": "Sophie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8926-3752"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Heart Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}], "LastName": "Tretter", "ForeName": "Justin T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0337-9338"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Children's Health Ireland, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland."}], "LastName": "McMahon", "ForeName": "Colin J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cardiol Young", "NlmUniqueID": "9200019", "ISSNLinking": "1047-9511"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Travel"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33685550", "10.1017/S1047951121000718", "S1047951121000718"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
