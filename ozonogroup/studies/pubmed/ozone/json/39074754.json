However, there is limited research on the impact of the alternating evolution of synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) on the multi-scale transport processes and sources of ozone. From June 14 to 18, 2018, a rare consecutive ozone pollution plagued in Hefei and broader Yangtze River Delta region (YRD). This study investigates the meteorological factors and sources using in-situ observational data and WRF-Chem model simulations. Analysis reveals a northeastern low-pressure system moving from north to south generated a cold front. This moving cold front facilitated the vertical transport of warm air masses carrying high-concentration ozone originating from North China. Subsequently, Ozone-rich air masses (ORMs) were transported over the YRD, influenced by the eastward movement of the Mongolian high-pressure system. Based on WRF-Chem model with NO<sub>x</sub> tagging mechanisms and WRF-FLEXPART backward simulations, it is confirmed that a notable atmospheric transport originated from North China region (NCR) to Hefei, especially on June 15. As the Mongolian high-pressure weakens and shifts east-southward, it carried ORMs generated by NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from the YRD, accumulating over the sea within the range of 120\u00b0E to 126\u00b0E and 25\u00b0N to 30\u00b0N. Both WRF-chem model results and TRopospheric Ozone and Precursors from Earth System Sounding (TROPESS) Chemistry Reanalysis dataset Version 2 (TCR-2) revealed the existence of ORMs in this geographic range. Subsequently, the ORMs carried out to sea by the weakened high-pressure system were reintroduced inland, influenced by southeast winds brought about by the peripheral circulation of typhoon \"Gaemi\". In summary, the alternating evolution of SWPs significantly influences multi-scale ozone transport from both the NCR and the YRD regions, making substantial contributions to this prolonged episode. These findings offer valuable insights for improving regional ozone pollution prevention and control mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
