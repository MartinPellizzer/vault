In this study, 23 organic compounds were conducted to study the reaction rate constants during O<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation. Then, two- and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were established to investigate the factors influencing the reaction rate constants by using multiple linear regression method and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) method, respectively. Both of the two models showed good performance on predicting the reaction rate constants, the associated statistical indices of 2D-QSAR and 3D-QSAR models were R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.898 and 0.952, q<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.841 and 0.951, Q<sub>ext</sub><sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.968 and 0.970, respectively. But varied in the influence factors, as for the 2D-QSAR model, three quantum chemical parameters, included dipole moment, the largest change of charge in each atom during the nucleophilic attack, the maximum positive partial charge on a hydrogen atom linked with a carbon atom affected the reaction rate. While in the 3D-QSAR model, the electrostatic field played the most important role in evaluating the reaction rate with the contribution of 35.8%, followed by hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrophobic fields with the contribution of 24.9% and 23.2%, respectively. These two models provided predictive tools to study the influencing factors for the degradation of organics and might potentially be applied for estimating the removal properties of unknown organics in O<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
