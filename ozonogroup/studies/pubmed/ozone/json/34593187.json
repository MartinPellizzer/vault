The traditional water treatment process can hardly achieve satisfactory removal of algae cells. This review examines the impact of pre-oxidation on the removal of cyanobacteria by solid-liquid separation processes. It was reported that the introduction of chemical oxidants such as chlorine, potassium permanganate, and ozone in algae-laden water pretreatment could improve algae removal by the subsequent solid-liquid separation processes. However, over dosed oxidants can result in more serious water quality risks due to significant algae cell lysis and undesirable intracellular organic matter release. It was suggested that moderate pre-oxidation may enhance the removal of cyanobacteria without damaging algae cells. In this article, effects of moderate pretreatment on the solid-liquid separation processes (sedimentation, dissolved air flotation, and membrane filtration) are reviewed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
