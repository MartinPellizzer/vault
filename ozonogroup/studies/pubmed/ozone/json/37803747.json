Base on it, this study further investigated its effects on flour properties (especially rheological properties) and volatile compounds (VOCs) profile of WHBF, and compared it with that of ultraviolet-C (UV-C), ozone and hot air (HA) treatments. The results showed that the damaged starch content (6.0%) of CIPD-treated WHBF was increased, leading to a rough surface and partial aggregation of starch particle, thereby increasing the particle size (18.06\u00a0\u03bcm of D10, 261.46\u00a0\u03bcm of D50 and 534.44\u00a0\u03bcm of D90). Besides, CIPD treatment exerted a positive influence on the structure and rheological properties of WHBF, including an elevation in pasting temperature and viscosity. Notably, CIPD-treated WHBF exhibited higher storage modulus and loss modulus compared to the other three groups of sterilization treatments, contributing to the formulation of a better-defined and stable gel strength (tan \u03b4\u00a0=\u00a00.38). UV-C and ozone, as cold sterilization techniques, also induced alterations in specific characteristics of WHBF. UV-C treatment led to changes in WHBF's crystallinity, while ozone treatment caused modifications in the secondary protein structure of WHBF. A total of 68 VOCs were identified in raw WHBF (including 3 acids, 19 alcohols, 25 aldehydes, 1 alkene, 8 esters, 2 ethers, 3 furans, and 7 ketones). The maximum flavor-contributing VOC in CIPD-treated WHBF remained dimethyl sulfide monomer (cabbage aroma), consistent with the raw WHBF. Conversely, in HA-treated WHBF, the maximum flavor-contributing VOC shifted to 2-furanmethanethiol monomer (roasted coffee aroma), altering the initial flavor presentation. These findings will provide strong support for the application of CIPD technology in the powdery foods industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
