Six wounds with 10 mm in diameter were created through the punch technique on the palatinal gingiva of each pig. Ozone gas was applied on only 3 wounds (test group) and the remaining 3 were left to natural healing (control group). Biopsy samples were taken from one of the wounds in each group on the third day, from another wound of each group on the seventh day, and from another one on the tenth day. Routine histological analysis and immuno-histochemical staining were performed to investigate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) and (VEGF) expressions.", "Results: No statistical difference was found between the test and control groups in terms of collagen fibers, epithelial formation and inflammation scores. A VEGF expression found in the test group was statistically higher than control group samples taken on the 3rd and 7th day. There was no statistical difference between the test and control groups in terms of TGF-\u03b2 expression on any of the sampling days.", "Conclusion: The topical application of ozone gas could be effective in the early stages of wound healing by increasing the amount of VEGF expression. Clinical Relevance: Topical application of ozone gas may be effective in the early stages of oral wound healing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hospital of Oral and Dental Health, Konya, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eroglu", "ForeName": "Zeynep Tastan", "Initials": "ZT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurtis", "ForeName": "Bulent", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Health Sciences, Gulhane Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Altug", "ForeName": "Hasan Ayberk", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biruni University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sahin", "ForeName": "Sermet", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tuter", "ForeName": "Gulay", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gazi University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral Pathology, Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baris", "ForeName": "Emre", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Oral Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101189774", "ISSNLinking": "1678-7757"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biopsy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gingiva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Patel PV, Kumar V, Kumar S, Vidya GD, Patel A.
