It was observed that mixing ratios of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors (such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0NO\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO)) showed significant differences on non-episode days and episode days. Additional knowledge was gained when a photochemical box model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism (PBM-MCM) was applied to further investigate the differences/similarities of O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry between non-episode and episode days, in terms of O<sub>3</sub>-precursor relationship, atmospheric photochemical reactivity and O<sub>3</sub> production. The simulation results revealed that, from non-O<sub>3</sub> episode days to episode days, 1) O<sub>3</sub> production changed from both VOC and NO<sub>x</sub>-limited (transition regime) to VOC-limited; 2) OH radicals increased and photochemical reaction cycling processes accelerated; and 3) both O<sub>3</sub> production and destruction rates increased significantly, resulting in an elevated net O<sub>3</sub> production over the SCS. The findings indicate the complexity of O<sub>3</sub> pollution over the SCS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
