During long-term operation of nearly 7 months, the efficiency of reactor 1 was preserved, although there was a 5% decrease in total COD elimination, compared with reactor 2. The released proteins and polysaccharides during sludge ozonation were effectively decomposed. The volatile suspended solid (VSS)/total suspended solid (TSS) ratio and the oxygen uptake rate in reactor 1 were lower than those in reactor 2 by 19% and 27%, respectively. However, the protease activity per gram of volatile suspended solids and the ammonium oxidation rate in reactor 1 were higher. The yields of sludge in reactor 1 fed with ozonated sludge were lower which implied that the cryptic growth using the organic autochthonous substrate might produce reduced biomass yields, which would decrease sludge production. The debris-like substances observed from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and the functional groups associated with calcite were only found in reactor 1 by FT-IR analysis, which implies that some of the inert or inorganic substances from sludge ozonation were accumulated in the reactor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Nuclear and New energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. chulibing@tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Li B", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jian L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Xin H", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xu L", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurcik", "ForeName": "Benjamin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20658411", "10.1080/10934529.2010.500882", "924739353"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
