Methods Data of daily outpatient visits for acne and concentrations of air pollutants(SO<sub>2</sub>,NO<sub>2</sub>,and O<sub>3</sub>8h)from January 2013 to December 2017 were collected.With the control of long-term trend and day-of-week effect,a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to analyze the lag and cumulative effects of air pollutants on the outpatient visits.The model was established based on the different groups of gender and age. Results During the study period,the average daily outpatient visits were 34.94\u00b115.27,and the average concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub>,NO<sub>2</sub>,and O<sub>3</sub>8h were 24.09,43.77,and 82.94 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>,respectively.The Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the daily outpatient visits for acne were positively correlated with NO<sub>2</sub> concentration while negatively correlated with O<sub>3</sub>8h concentration;SO<sub>2</sub> concentration was negatively correlated with O<sub>3</sub>8h concentration;NO<sub>2</sub> concentration was positively correlated with SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>8h concentrations.A 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in daily concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> was respectively associated with 2.61%(95% CI=0.98%-4.27%)and 1.71%(95% CI=0.54%-2.89%)increase in the outpatient visits for acne.A 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>3</sub>8h concentration was associated with -0.62%(95% CI=-1.12%--0.11%)increase in the outpatient visits.Multipollutant models indicated that air pollutant concentrations were significantly associated with the daily outpatient visits for acne. Conclusions SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> are positively associated with daily dermatological department visits for acne in Lanzhou,while O<sub>3</sub>8h concentration has a negative correlation with the visits.The sensitivity of acne daily outpatient visits to changes in SO<sub>2</sub>,NO<sub>2</sub>,and O<sub>3</sub>8h varies among patients of different genders and at different ages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatovenereology,The First School of Clinical Medicine,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Mohan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology,The First Hospital of Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Chun Rui", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatovenereology,The First School of Clinical Medicine,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatovenereology,The First School of Clinical Medicine,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Center,The First Hospital of Lanzhou University,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Guang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology,Lanzhou University Second Hospital,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zhi Cheng", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Center,Lanzhou University Second Hospital,Lanzhou 730000,China."}], "LastName": "Xi", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8006230", "ISSNLinking": "1000-503X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acne Vulgaris"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Outpatients"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33966695", "10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.12812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
