Each empty hospital room was disinfected, then contaminated with C.\u00a0difficile spores and disinfected with one of eight disinfection products: hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV; Bioquell Q10) 350-700 parts per million (ppm); dry ozone at 25\u00a0ppm (Meditrox); 1000\u00a0ppm chlorine-releasing agent (Actichlor Plus); microfibre cloths (Vermop) used in combination with and without a chlorine-releasing agent; high temperature over heated dry atomized steam cleaning (Polti steam) in combination with a sanitizing solution (HPMed); steam cleaning (Osprey steam); and peracetic acid wipes (Clinell). Swabs were inoculated on to C.\u00a0difficile-selective agar and colony counts were performed pre and post disinfection for each method. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also undertaken comparing all methods to the current method of 1000\u00a0ppm chlorine-releasing agent (Actichlor Plus).", "Products were ranked according to the log(10) reduction in colony count from contamination phase to disinfection. The three statistically significant most effective products were hydrogen peroxide (2.303); 1000\u00a0ppm chlorine-releasing agent (2.223) and peracetic acid wipes (2.134).", "The cheaper traditional method of using a chlorine-releasing agent for disinfection was as effective as modern methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 The Healthcare Infection Society.
