However it has been suggested as that its use in patients with respiratory distress should be decided cautiously. We treated 5 patients with abnormal posture, cervical hypertonia and obstructive respiratory distress by BTX-A, and analyzed its efficacy for respiratory distress by their Tsui score and respiratory status after BTX-A therapy. All 5 patients clinically had some degree of dysphagia before BTX-A therapy. Cervical hypertonia and induced abnormal posture were improved in all patients. The youngest patient could control muscle tone after only 2 doses of BTX-A and subsequently maintained a good condition without additional BTX-A. BTX-A therapy can decrease torsion and hyperextension of the upper respiratory tract by reducing cervical hypertonia. Consequently, it may improve respiratory status. On the other hand, mild dysphagia and excessive salivation was noted in one patient for each symptom. It is safe to avoid BTX-A invasion to the anterior muscle of neck and rapid changes in the swallowing pattern."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hashimoto", "ForeName": "Natsuko", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kagitani-Shimono", "ForeName": "Kuriko", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tominaga", "ForeName": "Koji", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitai", "ForeName": "Yukihiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "Tae", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okinaga", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taniike", "ForeName": "Masako", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Keiichi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "No To Hattatsu", "NlmUniqueID": "0215224", "ISSNLinking": "0029-0831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.69", "NameOfSubstance": "Botulinum Toxins, Type A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Botulinum Toxins, Type A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Hypertonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neck Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Insufficiency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22352024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
