Here, comprehensive chamber simulations on dark isoprene ozonolysis were conducted under different nitrogen dioxides (NO<sub>2</sub>) mixing ratios to exam multiple functionalized isoprene oxidation products. Aside from that the oxidation processes were concurrently driven by nitrogen radical (NO<sub>3</sub>) and small hydroxyl radicals (OH), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) cycloaddition at isoprene was launched initially regardless of NO<sub>2</sub> to rapidly form first-generation oxidation products, i.e., carbonyls and Criegee intermediates (CI) referred to carbonyl oxides. They could further undergo complicated self- and cross-reactions to produce alkylperoxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>). Corresponding to yields of the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>3</sub> tracer, weak OH pathway at night was credited to ozonolysis of isoprene but suppressed by unique NO<sub>3</sub> chemistry. Following the ozonolysis of isoprene, NO<sub>3</sub> played a crucial supplementary role in nighttime SOA formation. The ensuing production of gas-phase nitrooxy carbonyls (the first-generation nitrates) became dominant in the production of a sizeable pool of organic nitrates (RO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>). By contrast, isoprene dihydroxy dinitrates (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) were outstanding with the elevated NO<sub>2</sub>, related to typical second-generation nitrates. As such, the yielding number concentrations of dark SOA were promoted to approximately 1.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>-3</sup> but presented a nonlinear relation with excess high-NO<sub>2</sub> condition. This study provides valuable insights into importance of multifunctional organic compounds from alkene oxidation to constitute nighttime SOA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
