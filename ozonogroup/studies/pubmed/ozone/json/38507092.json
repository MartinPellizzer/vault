However, most investigations focus on the general population, with limited research conducted on medically insured populations. To address this gap, the current research was designed to examine the acute effects of inhalable particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) on the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), utilizing medical insurance data in Wuhan, China. Data on URTI were collected from the China Medical Insurance Basic Database for Wuhan covering the period from 2014 to 2018, while air pollutant data was gathered from ten national monitoring stations situated in Wuhan city. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized additive models for quasi-Poisson distribution with a log link function. The analysis indicated that except for ozone, higher exposure to four other pollutants (NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>) were significantly linked to an elevated risk of URTI, particularly during the previous 0-3 days and previous 0-4 days. Additionally, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were found to be positively linked with laryngitis. Furthermore, the effects of air pollutants on the risk of URTI were more pronounced during cold seasons than hot seasons. Notably, females and the employed population were more susceptible to infection than males and non-employed individuals. Our findings gave solid proof of the link between ambient air pollution exposure and the risk of URTI in medically insured populations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024.
