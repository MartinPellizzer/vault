A transient neutrophil influx accompanies upregulation of mucin messenger RNA (mRNA) before the onset of MCM. The present study was designed to examine the role of neutrophils in ozone-induced epithelial changes in the NTE of rats. Fourteen hours before inhalation exposure, male F344/N rats were injected intraperitoneally with antirat neutrophil antiserum to deplete circulating neutrophils, or were injected with normal (control) serum. Rats were then exposed to 0 ppm (filtered air) or 0.5 ppm ozone (8 h/d) for 1 or 3 d. Maxilloturbinates lined with NTE were analyzed to determine the epithelial labeling index; numeric densities of neutrophils, total epithelial cells, and mucous secretory cells; amount of stored intraepithelial mucosubstances; and steady-state ratMUC-5AC (mucin) mRNA levels. At 2 h after 3 d of exposure, rats treated with antiserum had 90% fewer circulating neutrophils than did rats treated with control serum. Antiserum-treated, ozone-exposed rats had 87% fewer infiltrating neutrophils than did control serum-treated, ozone-exposed rats. At 4 d after 3 d of exposure, antiserum-treated, ozone-exposed rats had 66% less stored intraepithelial mucosubstances and 58% fewer mucous cells in their NTE than did control serum-treated, ozone-exposed rats. Antiserum treatment had no effects on ozone-induced epithelial cell proliferation or mucin mRNA upregulation. The results of this study indicated that ozone-induced MCM was neutrophil-dependent, whereas ozone-induced epithelial cell proliferation and mucin gene upregulation were neutrophil-independent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Pharmacology, and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hotchkiss", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bennett", "ForeName": "C B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harkema", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL51712", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metaplasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mucins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophil Infiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10934098", "10.1164/ajrccm.162.2.9811078"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
