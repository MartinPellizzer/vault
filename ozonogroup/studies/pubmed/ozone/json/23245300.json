The efficiency of the applied oxidation processes (AOPs) has been estimated by the conversion of the original substrate (X(ENR) and X(CIP)) and the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC). Special emphasis was laid on the effect of varying reaction pH as well as of the applied oxidant doses on the observed reaction kinetics for each advanced oxidation processes. High degradation efficiencies, particularly in terms of rates of TOC and COD abatement, were obtained for photo-Fenton assisted ozonation [O(3)/UV/H(2)O(2)/Fe(II)], compared to other advanced oxidation processes. At pH 3 and 25\u00b0C best results for the degradation of both investigated drugs were achieved when 10\u00a0mM H(2)O(2), 0.5\u00a0mM Fe(II) and an initial dose of 8.5\u00a0mg L(-1) ozone were applied. In addition, the evolution of toxicity of the reaction mixtures for different AOPs has been studied by the bioluminescence test (LUMIStox 300)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Suceava, Faculty of Food Engineering, Suceava, Romania."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bobu", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yediler", "ForeName": "Ayfer", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siminiceanu", "ForeName": "Ilie", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feifang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulte-Hostede", "ForeName": "Sigurd", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluoroquinolones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3DX3XEK1BN", "NameOfSubstance": "Enrofloxacin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5E8K9I0O4U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enrofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fluoroquinolones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23245300", "10.1080/10934529.2013.726805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
