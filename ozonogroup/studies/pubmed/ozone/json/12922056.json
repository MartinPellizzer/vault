All models use 11 predictors (eight meteorological and three persistence variables) and are developed and validated between April and October from 1992 to 1999. Performance results based on a wide set of forecast quality measures indicate that the NNs provide better estimates of ozone concentrations at the monitoring sites, whilst the more often used linear models are less efficient at accurately forecasting high ozone concentrations. The violation of the European information threshold of 180 microg/m(3) is successfully predicted by the NN in 72% of the cases on average. Results at all stations are consistent with similar ozone forecast studies using NNs in other European cities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Heroon Polytechniou 9, Zografou Campus, 15780 Athens, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaloulakou", "ForeName": "Archontoula", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saisana", "ForeName": "Michaela", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spyrellis", "ForeName": "Nikolas", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12922056", "10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00335-8", "S0048-9697(03)00335-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
