This study investigated the influence of kLa on the ozonation of glass fiber wastewater using a high-performance jet loop reactor (HJLR), which is well known for its high mass transfer property, and compared the results of this investigation with those obtained using the bubble column reactor. It was found that the higher kLa achieved by increasing the energy input did not lead to higher ozonation efficiency, since the reaction involving the OH radical was greatly hindered at the low pH produced as a result of ozonation. By maintaining the pH at a value greater than 8.0, the higher kLa in the HJLR reactor contributed to increasing not only the TOC removal of wastewater, but also the ozone consumption efficiency, as expressed by the specific ozone consumption. The specific ozone consumption in the HJLR reactor (7.1 g ozone/ g TOC) was 20% better than that in the bubble column reactor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Cheongryang, Seoul, 130-650, Korea. byunsj@kist.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Byun", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geissen", "ForeName": "S U", "Initials": "SU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vogelpohl", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15077944"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
