This study investigates the degradation of three major toxic target organic species, namely terephthalic acid (TPA), isophthalic acid (IPA), benzoic acid (BA), present in the TPA wastewater, by several advanced oxidation processes. The performance of three main oxidation processes such as photofenton oxidation (UV-H(2)O(2)-Fe), photocatalytic ozonation (UV-O(3)-Fe) and photofenton ozonation (UV-O(3)-H(2)O(2)-Fe) were studied. Studies were conducted with and without dilution of TPA wastewater. Photofenton ozonation was found to be most efficient by achieving almost complete destruction of all the three target organics in less than 30 minutes of reaction. In combining several oxidation processes, a comparative study was also carried out between one step addition of oxidants and stepwise addition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, Chonnam, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thiruvenkatachari", "ForeName": "Ramesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ouk Kwon", "ForeName": "Tae", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shik Moon", "ForeName": "Il", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "39R4TAN1VT", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrous sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6S7NKZ40BQ", "NameOfSubstance": "terephthalic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8SKN0B0MIM", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16835120", "10.1080/10934520600754136", "GV61JW55U5044KL6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
