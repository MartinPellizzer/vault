In this work, ozone was evaluated as a tool to preserve grapes during drying, in terms of both qualitative and quantitative changes induced in the epiphytic microflora. In addition, the alteration exerted by ozone on grapes' chemical composition was analysed.", "Grapes from four vine varieties were treated with ozone produced by a cold plasma generator during the entire drying period (6\u00a0weeks). The microflora was quantified weekly by plate counts and characterized by 454-pyrosequencing, and was compared with identical, untreated grape samples. At the end of drying, an extensive chemical characterization of the whole mass of grapes by FT-IR and GC-MS was performed. Ozone counteracted the growth of microflora by reducing the microbial population up to 3 log units. From the qualitative point of view, ozone reduced the incidence of spoilage micro-organisms, such as Acetobacter and Botrytis cinerea, among the microbiota of grapes.", "The statistical analysis discriminates grape samples based on the residual epiphytic microflora at the end of drying and not on their chemical composition. These evidences confirmed that ozone did control spoilage micro-organisms without altering the volatile profile of grapes. Chemical analysis revealed that untreated grapes are less suitable for winemaking owing to the deprivation of some valuable compounds during the microbial proliferation.", "Ozone is an emerging tool in winemaking, recently applied for controlling spoilage micro-organisms in winery.
