In fact, NO had a very bad reputation of being destroyer of ozone, suspected carcinogen and precursor of acid rain. However, by the early 1990s it was well recognized by the medical research community. Over the last two decades, the picture has been totally changed. Diverse lines of evidence have converged to show that this sometime poison is a fundamental player in the everyday business of the human body. NO activity was probed in the brain, arteries, immune system, liver, pancreas, uterus, peripheral nerves, lungs, and almost every system in the human body. NO is a major player in the cardiovascular system as it is involved in regulating blood pressure. In the CNS, it is involved in memory formation and the regulation of cerebral blood flow to ensure adequate supply of blood to the brain. Because NO is involved in many pathways, it has a role in several diseases related to modern life as hypertension, coronary heart diseases, Alzheimer's Disease, stroke and cancer. This chapter focuses on the discussion of the role of NO in neurological diseases and cancer and how can this Janus-faced molecule play a role in the pathology and personalized treatment of these diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA), Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Maher", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA), Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel Rahman", "ForeName": "Mohamed F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Biochemistry Unit, Faculty of Pharmacy & Biotechnology, German University in Cairo (GUC), Cairo, Egypt. mohamed.gad@guc.edu.eg."}], "LastName": "Gad", "ForeName": "Mohamed Z", "Initials": "MZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrovascular Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28840553", "10.1007/978-3-319-60733-7_5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
