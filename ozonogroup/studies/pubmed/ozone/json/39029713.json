The required ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) dose is determined based on the target compounds during ozonation. Hydroxyl radicals are quantified using a probe compound. The para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) is typically used as a probe compound to measure hydroxyl radicals. However, real-time measurement is impossible, as the analysis process consumes time and resources. This study aimed to evaluate the spectroscopic characteristics of various organic substances in wastewater ozonation through fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis. The study also demonstrated that real-time analyzable tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF) can be used as a hydroxyl radical index. Importantly, the correlation between para-chlorobenzoic acid and TLF was derived, and the results showed a high correlation (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.91), confirming the reliability of our findings. Seven trace organic compounds, classified based on their reactivity with O<sub>3</sub> and hydroxyl radicals, were selected as target compounds and treated with O<sub>3</sub>. The TLF index was used as a model factor for the removal rate of the target compounds. The experimental and model values matched when the O<sub>3</sub> dose was below 1.0\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/g DOC (RMSE: 0.0445-0.0895)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
