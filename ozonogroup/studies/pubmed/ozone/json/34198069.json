Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts with different Mn loading were synthesized by hydrothermal method. XRD, SEM, XPS and H<sub>2</sub>-TPR were applied to characterize the catalysts. Among the catalysts prepared, the Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts with 5\u00a0wt% Mn loading presented the best performance in multicomponent VOCs degradation, which the highest removal efficiency (58.8% for acetone, 96.3% for toluene and 85.8% for ethyl acetate), the best carbon balance (87.5%) and CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity (51.9%) were obtained at a specific input energy (SIE) of 700\u00a0J\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. The formation of ozone was obviously inhibited with the introduction of Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts. The higher Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn ratio, higher O<sub>2</sub>/O<sup>2-</sup> ratio and excellent low-temperature reducibility were beneficial for the VOCs degradation. Highly dispersed Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystals on the surface of \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> also might be an explanation for the improvement of VOCs degradation. According to the result of GC-MS, the variety of organic by-products gradually decreased with the increase of SIE, and the degradation mechanism of the mixed VOCs in plasma and on catalyst surface was discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
