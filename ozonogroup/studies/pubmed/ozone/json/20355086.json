Ozone is a strong oxidant used for the disinfection of surfaces, drinking water and foods. However, since ozone not only destroys bacteria but may also damage eggs, it is necessary to clarify the effects of ozone treatment on hatching egg components. In this study, doses of gaseous ozone ranging from 10 to 50 mL L(-1) were tested. The vitamin A and E contents and fatty acid composition of the egg yolk were determined. To detect possible damage to the DNA of the germ disc, single-cell gel electrophoresis was used. Moreover, free SH groups were measured in the egg white. The soluble cuticula proteins were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.", "The yolk was not significantly affected by ozone treatment. However, the DNA of the germ disc was attacked and a significant decrease in free SH groups in the egg white was recorded at 50 mL L(-1) ozone. Even at low ozone doses the soluble cuticula proteins were completely destroyed.", "Significant alterations of egg components were caused by 50 mL L(-1) ozone. At lower ozone doses the oxidative processes occurred mainly at the egg surface and are therefore probably harmless to the developing embryo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry, University of Leipzig, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany. fuhrmann@vetmed.uni-leipzig.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuhrmann", "ForeName": "Herbert", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rupp", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcchner", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braun", "ForeName": "Peggy", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chick Embryo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Egg Shell"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Egg White"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Egg Yolk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["embryology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20355086", "10.1002/jsfa.3853"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
