The rotational distributions show a population alternation that favors the even states, as previously reported for a 300 K sample by Valentini <i>et al.</i> [J. Chem. Phys. <b>86</b>, 6745 (1987)]. The alternation from the jet-cooled precursor is much stronger than that observed by Valentini <i>et al.</i> and in contrast to their observations does not depend strongly on the O<sub>2</sub> (<i>a</i> <sup>1</sup>\u0394<sub>g</sub>) vibrational state or photolysis wavelength. The odd/even alternation diminishes substantially when the ozone beam temperature is increased from 60 to 200 K, confirming its dependence on parent internal energy. The magnitude of the even/odd alternation in product rotational states from the cold ozone sample, its temperature dependence, and other experimental and theoretical evidence reported since 1987 suggest that the alternation originates from a \u039b-doublet propensity and not from a mass independent curve crossing effect, as previously proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77842, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Warter", "ForeName": "Michelle L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77842, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gunthardt", "ForeName": "Carolyn E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77842, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan 49401, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000227903467"], "LastName": "McBane", "ForeName": "George C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77842, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "North", "ForeName": "Simon W", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30292221", "10.1063/1.5051540"]}}]}
