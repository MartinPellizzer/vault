Results demonstrated that EV71 inactivation by ozone was related to the kinetics of ozone solubility, approximately 99% inactivation being obtained in the exponential phase of ozone solubility. However, the inactivation rate was dependent on the ozone input flow rate and positively enhanced at acidic pH. Inactivation of intracellular EV71 was also studied. At a constant ozone supply of 60 mg/h, a significant reduction of intracellular virus titer (> or =99%, p < 0.01) was obtained after 45 or 60 min exposure but with low cell viability. Upon 30 min exposure, however, 45% cell viability was retained. The results indicate that the inactivating effect of ozone on intracellular EV71 virus is dependent on exposure duration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Fooyin University, Kaohsiung Hsien 831, Taiwan, Republic of China. dr005@mail.fy.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ya-Ching", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Sheng-Chi", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Antiviral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8109699", "ISSNLinking": "0166-3542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Inactivation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16838411", "10.1016/j.antiviral.2005.12.007", "S0166-3542(06)00007-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
