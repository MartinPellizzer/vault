While there has been a 4% to 9% increase in UV radiation since 1969 due to global ozone depletion, no firm evidence was found that focal ozone depletion was a particular problem in New Zealand. Christchurch residents were poorly informed about the ocular hazards of sunlight. A questionnaire completed by 200 adults disclosed 32% were unaware of the particular danger of UV light and only 3% knew that snow blindness, eclipse burns and cataracts could all be caused by sunlight. Fifty-four sunglasses were analysed for labelling and for transmission characteristics of their lenses. The standard of labelling of the sunglasses was poor with only 53% making reference to UV transmission characteristics and only three pairs stating that they adhered to the New Zealand Sunglass Standard. Attention is drawn to the need to improve public awareness of the potential for eye injury from sunlight and to improve the standard of labelling of sunglasses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borthwick", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clemett", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust N Z J Ophthalmol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505423", "ISSNLinking": "0814-9763"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eye"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "supply & distribution"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Protective Devices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "New Zealand"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "supply & distribution"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Devices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Protection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2357364", "10.1111/j.1442-9071.1990.tb00590.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
