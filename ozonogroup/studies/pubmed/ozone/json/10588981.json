In the intervening years, as the international commitment to a full transition away from all chlorofluorocarbon use took shape under the Montreal Protocol, the FDA has worked with industry to facilitate the development and testing of alternative technologies and products for inhalation drug products. As these alternative products begin to move from testing through the approval process and into marketing, the FDA is working collaboratively with the Environmental Protection Agency, other governmental agencies, and nongovernmental stakeholders to develop a transition policy for the United States. The transition policy for metered dose inhalers must be one that achieves the dual aims of first protecting the patients who rely on these vital medical products, while also achieving the public health need of protecting the ozone layer. As a part of developing such a transition strategy, the FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in March 1997. The ANPRM proposed mechanisms by which the FDA could determine when chlorofluorocarbon use in a drug product could no longer be considered essential. The ANPRM resulted in a large amount of valuable public debate and input. The FDA is now working to incorporate the knowledge gained from these public comments as it continues the rule-making process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Allergy Drug Products, and the CFC Work Group, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD 20857, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meyer", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legislation, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Food and Drug Administration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10588981", "10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70037-0", "S0091-6749(99)70037-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
