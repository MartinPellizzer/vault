Of the purine and pyrimidine compounds examined in this study, uric acid showed the greatest susceptibility to ozone-induced degradation. The parent compounds, purine and pyrimidine, were more resistant to ozonation than were the nucleobases. When the degradation of OH-substituted purines was examined, it was found that the more OH groups on the purine ring, the more readily the purine was degraded. Urea and allantoin were identified as degradation products of uric acid. The relative rates of nucleobase degradation in the presence and absence of uric acid were compared. Uric acid protected thymine, guanine, and uracil from degradation by ozone. In this system uric acid was found to protect the nucleobases as effectively as reduced glutathione."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meadows", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Purines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrimidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56HH86ZVCT", "NameOfSubstance": "Uracil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5Z93L87A1R", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QR26YLT7LT", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Paper"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Guanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Purines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrimidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uracil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3707135", "10.1016/0003-9861(86)90340-1", "0003-9861(86)90340-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
