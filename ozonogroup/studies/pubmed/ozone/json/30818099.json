In this work, a novel multi-stages flow through peroxi-coagulation (PC) was for the first time developed with graphite felt cathode modified by graphene, showing an excellent performance in removal of 71.5% COD, 72.3% phenol and 59.4% NH<sub>3</sub>-N and significant biodegradability enhancement with a low energy consumption as 1.2\u202fkWh/m<sup>3</sup>. Compared with conventional flow PC, this process was more cost-effective due to more intensive <sup>.</sup>OH production and higher utilization of generated active species. Through UV spectrophotometry and GC-MS analysis, the improvement of biodegradability was attributed to the reduction of both low and high molecular weight compounds content in the coking wastewater. Comparing to the electro-Fenton, electrocoagulation and ozonation process, the proposed PC process was highly cost-effective, providing a promising and new alternative for pretreatment of coking wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
