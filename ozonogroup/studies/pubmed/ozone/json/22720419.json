An ozone dosage of 57 mg min(-1) was found to be optimal for the degradation of both endosulfan (89%) and lindane (43%). The pH of the reaction mixtures play a profound role on the extent of degradation and it was observed that alkaline conditions favours the generation of hydroxyl radicals and thus a pH of 10 was chosen as the optimum for endosulfan degradation as the degradation efficiency was found to be 93%. A pH value of 12 was chosen as the optimum for lindane degradation as the degradation efficiency was observed to be 82%. Kinetics of degradation was performed and the set of data was fitted into first-order kinetics of the reaction for both endosulfan and lindane. The observed rate constants (k(obs')) for 5, 7.5 and 10 ppm initial endosulfan concentrations were 0.0274, 0.0273 and 0.0161 min(-1), respectively. While for initial lindane concentrations of 5, 7.5 and 10 ppm, the observed rate constants were 0.0243, 0.0333 and 0.056 min(-1), respectively. Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that endosulfan was degraded into methyl cyclohexane and o-xylene which disappeared as reaction proceeded and lindane was degraded to 1-hexene indicating the ring fission mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), 4th Main, II Cross, Domlur II Stage, Bangalore 560071, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Begum", "ForeName": "Asfiya", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gautam", "ForeName": "Sumit Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "59NEE7PCAB", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexachlorocyclohexane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OKA6A6ZD4K", "NameOfSubstance": "Endosulfan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endosulfan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hexachlorocyclohexane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22720419", "10.1080/09593330.2011.603752"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
