Data collected during this study suggests that the ozonation process removed color (represented as A400) more efficiently than chemical oxygen demand (COD) regardless of initial experimental conditions. With a 40-minute run time, the maximum A400 and COD removal efficiencies were 99.9 and 52.9%, respectively. Results indicated that the addition of COD to the system in the form of glucose had no effect on color removal efficiencies. The removal efficiencies of both color (A400) and COD in relation to the ozone utilized by the system were modeled using two previously derived empirical methods. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of both models to predict removal efficiencies of process parameters such as color and COD and to estimate ozone utilization. Results indicate both models predict color (A400) and COD removal as well as ozone utilization, but care should be taken when using the models to describe removal efficiencies when the wastewater inlet characteristics are variable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Mercer University, Macon, Georgia 31207, USA. lackey_l@mercer.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lackey", "ForeName": "Laura W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mines", "ForeName": "Richard O", "Initials": "RO", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19123100", "10.1080/10934520802539871", "907331583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
