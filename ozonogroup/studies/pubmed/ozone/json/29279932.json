The study included the entire Medicare population from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012, residing in 39\u202f182 zip codes.", "Daily PM2.5 and ozone levels in a 1-km \u00d7 1-km grid were estimated using published and validated air pollution prediction models based on land use, chemical transport modeling, and satellite remote sensing data. From these gridded exposures, daily exposures were calculated for every zip code in the United States. Warm-season ozone was defined as ozone levels for the months April to September of each year.", "All-cause mortality in the entire Medicare population from 2000 to 2012.", "During the study period, there were 22\u202f433\u202f862 million case days and 76\u202f143\u202f209 control days. Of all case and control days, 93.6% had PM2.5 levels below 25 \u03bcg/m3, during which 95.2% of deaths occurred (21\u202f353\u202f817 of 22\u202f433\u202f862), and 91.1% of days had ozone levels below 60 parts per billion, during which 93.4% of deaths occurred (20\u202f955\u202f387 of 22\u202f433\u202f862). The baseline daily mortality rates were 137.33 and 129.44 (per 1 million persons at risk per day) for the entire year and for the warm season, respectively. Each short-term increase of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in PM2.5 (adjusted by ozone) and 10 parts per billion (10-9) in warm-season ozone (adjusted by PM2.5) were statistically significantly associated with a relative increase of 1.05% (95% CI, 0.95%-1.15%) and 0.51% (95% CI, 0.41%-0.61%) in daily mortality rate, respectively. Absolute risk differences in daily mortality rate were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.29-1.56) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.78) per 1 million persons at risk per day. There was no evidence of a threshold in the exposure-response relationship.", "In the US Medicare population from 2000 to 2012, short-term exposures to PM2.5 and warm-season ozone were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality. This risk occurred at levels below current national air quality standards, suggesting that these standards may need to be reevaluated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.
