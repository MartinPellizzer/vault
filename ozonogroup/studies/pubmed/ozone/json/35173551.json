And the initiation of EMT in the airways depends on the epithelial disruption involving dissolution and/or destabilization of the adhesive structures between the cells and ECM. Previously, we have shown that integrin-\u03b24, an epithelial adhesion molecule in bronchial epithelium is an important regulator of cell proliferation and wound repair in human airway epithelial cells. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate whether integrin-\u03b24 also regulates EMT phenotypes during injury and repair in airway epithelial cells of both wild type/integrin-\u03b24<sup>-/-</sup> mice <i>in vivo</i> and cultured cells treated with integrin-\u03b24/nonsense siRNA <i>in vitro</i>. <b>Methods:</b> We induced injury to the airway epithelial cells by either repeated exposure to ozone and mechanical scratch wound, and subsequently examined the EMT-related phenotypic features in the airway epithelial cells including biomarkers expression, adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization and cell stiffness. <b>Results:</b> The results show that in response to injury (ozone exposure/scratch wound) and subsequent spontaneous repair (ozone withdrawal/wound healing) both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, the airway epithelial cells underwent dynamic changes in the epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers expression, adhesion and cytoskeleton structures as well as cell stiffness, all together exhibiting enhanced EMT phenotypic features after injury and reversal of the injury-induced effects during repair. Importantly, these injury/repair-associated EMT phenotypic changes in airway epithelial cells appeared to be dependent on integrin-\u03b24 expression. More specifically, when integrin-\u03b24 was deficient in mice (integrin-\u03b24<sup>-/-</sup>) the repair of ozone-injured airway epithelium was impaired and the recovery of ozone-enhanced EMT biomarkers expression in the airway epithelium was delayed. Similarly, in the scratch wounded airway epithelial cells with integrin-\u03b24 knockdown, the cells were impaired in all aspects related to EMT during wound and repair including cell proliferation, wound closure rate, adhesion and cytoskeleton protein expression (vinculin and vimentin), mesenchymal-like F-actin reorganization, cell stiffness and RhoA activation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Taken together, these results suggested that integrin-\u03b24 may be essential in regulating the effects of injury and repair on EMT in airway epithelial cells via influencing both the cell adhesion to ECM and cells' physical phenotypes through RhoA signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
