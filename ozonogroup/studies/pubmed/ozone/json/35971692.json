The results showed that the average hourly concentration of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) during the polluted period[(50.6\u00b128.3)] \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> was 32.5% higher than that during the non-polluted period[(38.2\u00b124.9) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>]. The contribution of all VOCs categories were as follows:alkanes>aromatics>alkenes>alkynes, and the diurnal averages of TVOC and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were opposite during the polluted and non-polluted period. Ozone formation potential (OFP),\u00b7OH radical loss rate (<i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>), and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOA<sub>p</sub>) during the polluted period were higher than those during the non-polluted period. Alkenes contributed most to OFP and <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>, whereas aromatics contributed most to SOA<sub>p</sub>. The tendency of the diurnal average of OFP and SOA<sub>p</sub> was overall consistent with that of TVOC. The priority species of OFP, <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>, and SOA<sub>p</sub> were alkenes and aromatics. The VOCs/NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> method was applied to identify the O<sub>3</sub>-VOC-NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> sensitivity during the polluted and non-polluted periods, and the results showed that the photochemical regimes were VOCs-limited and transition regions. In addition, the smog production model (SPM) was employed to identify the O<sub>3</sub> formation regime, and the results showed that those during the polluted period were identified as VOCs-limited and transition regions from 08:00 to 16:00, whereas the non-polluted period was mainly considered to be VOCs-limited. To mitigate the O<sub>3</sub> pollution in summertime, the synergistic control of VOCs (especially alkenes and aromatics) and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions should be enforced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin 300384, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Zibo Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Zibo 255000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin-Wu", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin 300384, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Zibo Eco-Environmental Monitoring Center, Zibo 255000, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Chun-Mei", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35971692", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202111073"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
