Data collected from March 2009 to September 2010 revealed average mixing ratios of 37\u00b114 ppb for O(3) and 188\u00b182 ppb for CO at this remote site. Diurnal variations for both O(3) and CO were observed as well in all seasons. The higher levels for O(3) and CO in the afternoon were attributed to transport of boundary layer pollution to the site during daytime upslope flow. Monthly means of both O(3) and CO showed maxima in spring and in the continental air masses from Southeast Asia, coastal China, and Korea/Japan. On the contrary, the lower O(3) and CO levels found in summer were due to the marine air masses originating from the Philippine Sea and Pacific Ocean. The relationship between O(3) and CO was analyzed, using nighttime data to minimize any local influence. The results showed a fairly good correlation between O(3) and CO from March to September. The contribution of CO from the Asian outflow reached a maximum in spring (88 ppb) and had a minimum in summer (27 ppb). The photochemical buildup of O(3) resulting from anthropogenic emissions in continental Asia was estimated to be 15 ppb in spring, while its production was insignificant, with an average of 4 ppb, in summer. A positive correlation between O(3) and CO plus high ozone levels in springtime suggested that the enhancements of O(3) were likely due to O(3) which was photochemically produced over this region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.
