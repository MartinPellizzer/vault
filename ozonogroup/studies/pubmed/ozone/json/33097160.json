By deploying a UV radiometer aboard a stratospheric balloon released at Qaidam (QDM) during the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) period in 2019, we provided in situ measurement of the UV profiles from the surface to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), China, for the first time. Based on two in situ UV profiles accompanied by four ozonesonde measurements, this study exhibited detailed variations of downwelling UV and vertical ozone distributions over the TP during the ASM period. The UV differences between the surface and stratospheric balloon flight altitudes were 16.7, 15.8, 12.6 and 18.0\u00a0Wm<sup>-2</sup> during the four ozonesonde launches. Due to the diurnal variations in photochemical production and the stratosphere-troposphere exchange, the integrated ozone columns below 30\u00a0km ranged from 184.4 to 221.6 DU from four ozonesonde measurements. A positive correlation between UV attenuation and ozone column was exhibited under low cloud cover and clear sky conditions. The results of this study are expected to improve our understanding of UV and ozone properties, as well as their potential effects on terrestrial ecosystems and living environments over this significant plateau."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
