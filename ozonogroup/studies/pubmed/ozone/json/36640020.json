The influence of ozonation on short- and long-term biodegradation potential was examined through respirometry and Zahn-Wellens, respectively. Ecotoxicity was also examined for several concentrate batches and ozonation steps. Chemical oxidation through ozone had a beneficial effect on chemical oxygen demand removal, with a removal efficiency up to 56%. Formation of short-term biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>st</sub>) was induced for several, but not all batches, showing the potential of subsequent biological treatment of ozonated ROC. An increase in the inherent biodegradability through Zahn-Wellens was observed for all tested samples after ozonation, rising to a maximum of 68% after 3 hours of ozonation, highlighting the importance of sludge adaptation. Ecotoxicity, tested with Artemia franciscana and the saltwater algae P. tricornutum, showed initial decreases in algae inhibition after short ozonation periods. An increase in algae inhibition was, however, seen after prolonged ozonation for all tested ROC samples, pointing to the formation of ecotoxic by-products. Artemia showed no significant toxicity effects. When applying biological treatment through Zahn-Wellens, a decrease in ecotoxicity was observed for several samples, likely through biological oxidation of the produced degradation products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Engineering, Biochemical Wastewater Valorization and Engineering (BioWAVE), University of Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, 2020 Antwerp, Belgium E-mail: jan.dries2@uantwerpen.be."}], "LastName": "Poelmans", "ForeName": "Sven", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Process and Environmental Technology Lab (PETLab), KU Leuven, Jan De Nayerlaan 5, 2860 Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Nagels", "ForeName": "Maarten", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, INSA Rouen, CNRS, COBRA (UMR 6014), 76800 Saint Etienne du Rouvray, France."}], "LastName": "Mignot", "ForeName": "M\u00e9lanie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Process and Environmental Technology Lab (PETLab), KU Leuven, Jan De Nayerlaan 5, 2860 Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Dewil", "ForeName": "Raf", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Pharmaceutical Analysis, KU Leuven, O&N II Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Cabooter", "ForeName": "Deirdre", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Engineering, Biochemical Wastewater Valorization and Engineering (BioWAVE), University of Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, 2020 Antwerp, Belgium E-mail: jan.dries2@uantwerpen.be."}], "LastName": "Dries", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36640020", "10.2166/wst.2022.408"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
