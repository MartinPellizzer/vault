Experimental design and optimization were carried out using Central Composite Design of Response Surface Methodology. The results of experiments showed that the most effective and influencing factors in photo-Fenton process were H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> ratio, in ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV experiment were O<sub>3</sub> concentration, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, reaction time and pH and in photocatalytic process were TiO<sub>2</sub> concentration, pH and reaction time. The highest COD removal in photo-Fenton, ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV and photocatalytic process were 90%, 92% and 55%, respectively. The results were analyzed by design expert software and for all three processes second-order models were proposed to simulate the COD removal efficiency. In conclusion the ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV process is recommended for the treatment of gray water, since it was able to remove both COD and turbidity by 92% and 93%, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
