Mean monthly surface level of O3 concentrations varied from 27.7 ppb to 59.0 ppb during the experimental period. Both UV-B and O03 induced the production of ROS (H2O2 and O2*-), resulting in significant damage of membranes due to lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage. Synthesis of secondary metabolites (flavonoids, anthocyanin, lignin and wax) was also enhanced in all the treatments, whereas biomass and yield were reduced. Alterations in frequency of stomata and wax distribution were also observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cultivar Padmini was found to be more sensitive because of higher damage of membrane vis-a-vis reduction in biomass and seed yield. However, concentrations of flavonoids, anthocyanin, lignin and wax were higher in T-397, suggesting its relative resistance against applied stress. Combined exposure of sUV-B and O3 was less harmful, as compared to their individual treatment. Among the three treatments, O3 was found to be more detrimental for overall growth and sUV-B for economic yield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Ruchika", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0310774", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waxes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flax"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Waxes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24772952"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
