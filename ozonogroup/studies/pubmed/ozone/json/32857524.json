The reaction was first-order with respect to graphite and to the consumption of ozone. X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) showed that the reactions occurring in the solid under steady-state conditions maintain the original stoichiometry, as predicted by the postulated mechanism for SO<sub>2</sub>. The deoxygenation reaction occurred along with the ozonation reaction at 100 \u00b0C. The rate of oxygen elimination in the flow system has the same rate-determining kinetic barrier as ozone insertion. Ozonation and deoxygenation reactions are sequentially related. Ozonation occurs with the insertion of O<sub>3</sub>, forming a 1,2,3-trioxolane followed by an oxygen transfer that produces a peroxide valence tautomer in equilibrium with 1,3-dicarbonyl, [peroxide \u2194 dicarbonyl], and an oxirene that eliminates atomic oxygen. The decarboxylation reaction was studied at 600 \u00b0C from the ozonated G<sub>106</sub> (\u0394<i>G</i><sup>\u2260</sup> = 83.60 \u00b1 0.08 kcal\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>). Total decarboxylation at 600 \u00b0C matched the number of moles of CO<sub>2</sub> removed and the oxygen content after ozonation, showing that the reduction of ozone on graphite was essentially a clean reduction with no secondary oxidations. When ozonized graphite was heated to 600 \u00b0C, only [peroxide \u2194 dicarbonyl] species remained in the matrix. The peroxide tautomer isomerized to dioxirane and eliminated CO<sub>2</sub> as a dioxicarbene. Total deoxygenation of decarboxylated graphite G<sub>106</sub> was obtained by pyrolysis. There was residual oxygen that arose from the atomic oxygen eliminated from the oxirene, intercalated in graphite layers, and formed basal epoxy groups. Also, incoming O atoms reacted with the intercalated O atoms to produce O<sub>2</sub> molecules. Thermal annealing deintercalated molecular oxygen (600-900 \u00b0C)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9740-2756"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Humeres", "ForeName": "Eduardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8709-8052"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Castro", "ForeName": "Karen M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8809-8457"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Debacher", "ForeName": "Nito Angelo", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2863-7260"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Regina de F P M", "Initials": "RFPM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32857524", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01372"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
