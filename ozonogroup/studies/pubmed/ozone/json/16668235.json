A plant's productivity in environments with ozone may be related to its ability to scavenge the free radicals formed. The effects of ozone on photosynthesis and some free radical scavengers were measured in the fifth emergent leaf of poplars. Clonal poplars (Populus deltoides x Populus cv caudina) were fumigated with 180 parts per billion ozone for 3 hours. Photosynthesis was measured before, during, and after fumigation. During the first 90 minutes of ozone exposure, photosynthetic rates were unaffected but glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity increased. After 90 minutes of ozone exposure, photosynthetic rates began to decline while glutathione and superoxide dismutase continued to increase. Total glutathione (reduced plus oxidized) increased in fumigated leaves throughout the exposure period. The ratio of GSH/GSSG also decreased from 12.8 to 1.2 in ozone exposed trees. Superoxide dismutase levels increased twofold in fumigated plants. After 4 hours of ozone exposure, the photosynthetic rate was approximately half that of controls while glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity remained above that of the controls. The elevated antioxidant levels were maintained 21 hours after ozone exposure while photosynthetic rates recovered to about 75% of that of controls. Electron transport and NADPH levels remained unaffected by the treatment. Hence, elevated antioxidant metabolism may protect the photosynthetic apparatus during exposure to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14953."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alscher", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCune", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1988 Oct 25;263(30):15652-6", "ArticleIdList": ["3170604"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1974 Jan;53(1):32-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16658647"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Sep;76(1):125-30", "ArticleIdList": ["16663782"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1979 Jun 5;546(3):426-35", "ArticleIdList": ["454577"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Biochem. 1978 Nov 15;91(2):339-44", "ArticleIdList": ["729573"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1973 Jul 12;317(1):50-64", "ArticleIdList": ["4723247"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Jun;69(6):1444-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16662420"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Dec;88(4):1115-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16666430"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Sep;73(1):185-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16663173"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1985 Dec;79(4):1044-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16664526"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1978 Jan;61(1):80-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16660243"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1980 Aug 1;189(2):373-6", "ArticleIdList": ["6257234"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1986 Sep;82(1):336-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16665019"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1949 Jan;24(1):1-15", "ArticleIdList": ["16654194"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16668235", "PMC1080820", "10.1104/pp.96.2.650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
