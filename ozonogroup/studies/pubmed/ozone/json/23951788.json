Teeth were randomly divided into the three experimental groups: Opalescence Quick, Ozicure Oxygen Activator and control. The three experimental groups received three treatments of one hour each over three consecutive days. Tooth colour was assessed using the Vitapan 3D Master Tooth Guide (VITA, Germany). A General Linear Models test for analysis of variance for a fractional design with significance set at P < 0.05 was used to test for significance.", "Both bleaching methods significantly lightened the teeth (P < 0.0001). Tooth colour change was mainly after the first hour of tooth bleaching. The tooth type was significant in tooth colour change (P = 0.0416). Tooth colour relapse and resistance to colour change were observed.", "Ozicure Oxygen Activator bleached teeth in a manner and to an extent similar to Opalescence Quick."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, University of the Western Cape, South Africa. grundlingh@iburst.co.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grundlingh", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grossman", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witcomb", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "SADJ", "NlmUniqueID": "9812497", "ISSNLinking": "1029-4864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyls"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tooth-bleaching agent, Opalescence"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bicuspid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cuspid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Incisor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyls"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23951788"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
