A myriad of complaints including headache, fatigue, fever, and respiratory difficulties among many others have been registered, particularly by flight attendants on long haul routes. There is also much concern today regarding the transmission of contagious disease inflight, particularly tuberculosis. The unanswered question is whether these complaints are really due to poor cabin air quality or to other factors inherent inflight such as lowered barometric pressure, hypoxia, low humidity, circadian dysynchrony, work/rest cycles, vibration etc. This paper will review some aspects relevant to cabin air quality such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), particulates, and microorganisms as well as the cabin ventilation system to discern if there is a possible cause and effect of illness contracted inflight. The paper will conclude with recommendations on how the issue of cabin air quality may be resolved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA 22314-3579, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rayman", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Uchu Koku Kankyo Igaku", "NlmUniqueID": "9425137", "ISSNLinking": "0387-0723"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerospace Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Conditioning"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Aviation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximum Allowable Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}], "NumberOfReferences": "7"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12715825"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
