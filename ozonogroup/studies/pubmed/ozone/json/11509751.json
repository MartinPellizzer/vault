Rats were exposed to 1 ppm O3 for 3 days. Expression of cell-surface molecules was measured by flow cytometry. Accessory activity of BAL cells was assessed by the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and specific antigen-presenting activity. O3 exposure increased the expression of Ia, B7.1, B7.2, and CD11b/c on BAL cells. Morphological and immunological studies showed the Ia-positive cells to have monocyte-like features. Peripheral blood monocytes expressed Ia, B7.1, B7.2, and CD11b/c. The Ia expression on the monocytes was further increased by treatment of them with BAL fluid from O3-exposed rats (O3-BALF). Resident alveolar macrophages, however, did not express Ia antigen, and the Ia expression was not increased by O3-BALF. Neutrophils, which also infiltrated in response to O3 exposure, did not express Ia, B7.1, and B7.2. Therefore, infiltrating monocytes may have caused the increased expression of Ia and B7 molecules on BAL cells exposed to O3. The accessory activity of BAL cells in terms of MLR and specific antigen-presenting activity was also enhanced by O3 exposure. The present study suggests that monocytes infiltrating in response to O3 exposure caused enhancements of the expression of Ia and costimulatory molecules on and the accessory activity of BAL cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8575, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koike", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimojo", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, CD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "B7-1 Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "B7-2 Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD11 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cd86 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigen Presentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigen-Presenting Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, CD"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "B7-1 Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "B7-2 Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "CD11 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymph Nodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11509751", "10.1093/toxsci/63.1.115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
