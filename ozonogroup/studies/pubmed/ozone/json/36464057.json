To characterize the relationship between VOCs and SOA, organics both in gas and particulate phases were concurrently measured in urban Beijing. The VOCs and organic aerosol (OA) were apportioned into factors with different oxidation levels by applying the factorization analysis on their detailed mass spectra. Six factors of VOCs were identified, including four primary VOCs (PVOC) factors and two secondary VOCs (SVOC) factors. The PVOC factors dominated the total VOCs when the air mass originated in the cleaner northern areas, while SVOC factors dominated for polluted southern air masses. The normalized concentrations of PVOC and primary OA factors showed consistent diurnal variations regardless of air mass directions, owing to the relatively stable local emissions during the experimental period. This contrasted with the secondary factors due to more complex transformation processes. The traffic-related VOCs and solid fuel combustion VOCs negatively correlated with SOA, implying that they may have contributed to the SOA formation through photooxidation. The VOCs in lower oxidation levels were found to have poor correlations with the less oxidized SOA, whereas they correlated strongly to the more oxidized SOA. This implied that the less oxidized SOA may be in a transition state, where its production and loss rates were balanced. These served as products of VOCs oxidation and reactants of more oxidized SOA formation, playing important roles on the VOC to SOA transformation. The identified VOC emission sources and their photochemical production of SOA should be considered in air quality policy planning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
