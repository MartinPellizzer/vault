The proposed method includes two parts: a selective sorbent for ozone, that is, eugenol, and a formaldehyde amperometric biosensor mounted into a flow-through cell. Ozone adds rapidly to the double bond of the allyl group of eugenol, which has been immobilized onto a hydrophobic C-18 reactor and the so produced formaldehyde is collected into the working buffer solution (sampler) and pumped to the detector. A multimembrane assembly consisting of an alcohol oxidase-modified nylon membrane sandwiched between an outer polycarbonate and an inner cellulose acetate membrane was fitted onto a Pt electrode and the enzymatically produced H2O2 was monitored at +0.65 V (vs Ag/AgCl/KCl 3 M). Under optimum conditions, a linear calibration curve over the concentration range 3-200 microg x mL(-1) ozone was constructed. The detection limit (S/N = 3) was calculated at 1.1 microg x mL(-1) ozone. The proposed method is interference-free from other gases such as O2, Ar, N2, N2O, NOCl, SO2, NH3, and CO2, which were tested at concentrations >200-fold higher than that of 100 microg x mL(-1) ozone used for comparison. Besides selectivity, the method is easy to perform and reproducible; its applicability in synthetic gaseous samples is also demonstrated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, 45110-Ioannina, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stergiou", "ForeName": "Dimitrios V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prodromidis", "ForeName": "Mamas I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veltsistas", "ForeName": "Panayotis G", "Initials": "PG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evmiridis", "ForeName": "Nicholaos P", "Initials": "NP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.3.13", "NameOfSubstance": "alcohol oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosensing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16808481", "10.1021/ac060230h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
