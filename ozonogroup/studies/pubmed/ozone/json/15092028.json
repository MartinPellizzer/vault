Each site is equipped for collection of continuous meteorological and ozone data and weekly average concentrations of SO4(2-), NO3-, SO2 and HNO3, using a three-stage filter pack. Results from 40 eastern US sites operational throughout 1989 show species-dependent variability from site to site, season to season, and day to night. Annual average concentrations of atmospheric SO4(2-), NO3-, SO2 and HNO3 ranged from 2.7 to 7.9, 0.2 to 3.9, 2.4 to 23.2 and 0.7 to 3.6 microg/m(-3), respectively. Seasonal variability was considerable for all constituents. Day/night data indicate that SO2 and HNO3, but not SO4(2-) and NO3-, are typically found at moderately to substantially lower concentrations at night, especially during spring and summer. Estimated dry deposition for SO2 and HNO3 appear to be much greater than for SO4(2-) and NO3-, respectively. Comparison of measured wet deposition and estimated dry deposition at numerous sites suggests that the two are similar in magnitude over much of the eastern USA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc., PO Box 1607, Gainesville, FL 32602-1607, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edgerton", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lavery", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boksleitner", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092028", "10.1016/0269-7491(92)90034-8", "0269-7491(92)90034-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
