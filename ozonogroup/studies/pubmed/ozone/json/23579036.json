Every skin burn was subdivided in two symmetrical parts. One part was treated with occlusive application of ozonated oil; the contralateral part of the lesion was treated with topical application of hyaluronic acid gel, once a day for 12 weeks. A clinical evaluation and an intra-vital video-capillaroscopy were performed on every patient at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks after.", "All treated lesions improved regardless of the treatment used. Ozonated oil was as effective as hyaluronic acid in improving erythema, tension, itching and burning sensation reported by patients, and it does not exert a specific anti-angiogenic effect compared to hyaluronic acid.
