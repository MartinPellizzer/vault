However, our knowledge on this heterogeneous chemistry remains inadequate. In this study, the heterogeneous oxidation of \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis SOA by hydroxyl (OH) radicals was investigated under both low and high relative humidity (RH) conditions, with an emphasis on the evolution of molecular composition of SOA and its RH dependence. It is found that the heterogeneous oxidation of SOA at an OH exposure level equivalent to 12 hr of atmospheric aging leads to particle mass loss of 60% at 25% RH and 95% at 90% RH. The heterogeneous oxidation strongly changes the molecular composition of SOA. The dimer-to-monomer signal ratios increase dramatically with rising OH exposure, in particular under high RH conditions, suggesting that aerosol water stimulates the reaction of monomers with OH radicals more than that of dimers. In addition, the typical SOA tracer compounds such as pinic acid, pinonic acid, hydroxy pinonic acid and dimer esters (e.g., C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) have lifetimes of several hours against heterogeneous OH oxidation under typical atmospheric conditions, which highlights the need for the consideration of their heterogeneous loss in the estimation of monoterpene SOA concentrations using tracer-based methods. Our study sheds lights on the heterogeneous oxidation chemistry of monoterpene SOA and would help to understand their evolution and impacts in the atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
