We examined the associations between air pollution exposure and circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts in humans. To investigate independent contributions of particulate matter (PM) characteristics, we exposed 31 healthy volunteers at five locations with high contrast and reduced correlations amongst pollutant components: two traffic sites, an underground train station, a farm and an urban background site. Each volunteer visited at least three sites and was exposed for 5\u2009h with intermittent exercise. Exposure measurements on-site included PM mass and number concentration, oxidative potential (OP), elemental- and organic carbon, metals, O3 and NO2. Total and differential WBC counts were performed on blood collected before and 2 and 18\u2009h post-exposure (PE). Changes in total WBC counts (2 and 18\u2009h PE), number of neutrophils (2\u2009h PE) and monocytes (18\u2009h PE) were positively associated with PM characteristics that were high at the underground site. These time-dependent changes reflect an inflammatory response, but the characteristic driving this effect could not be isolated. Negative associations were observed for NO2 with lymphocytes and eosinophils. These associations were robust and did not change after adjustment for a large suite of PM characteristics, suggesting an independent effect of NO2. We conclude that short-term air pollution exposure at real-world locations can induce changes in WBC counts in healthy subjects. Future studies should indicate if air pollution exposure-induced changes in blood cell counts results in adverse cardiovascular effects in susceptible individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Toxicology and Division of Environmental Epidemiology, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University , Utrecht , The Netherlands ."}], "LastName": "Steenhof", "ForeName": "Maaike", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Janssen", "ForeName": "Nicole A H", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Strak", "ForeName": "Maciej", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hoek", "ForeName": "Gerard", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gosens", "ForeName": "Ilse", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mudway", "ForeName": "Ian S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "Frank J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "Roy M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pieters", "ForeName": "Raymond H H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cassee", "ForeName": "Flemming R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brunekreef", "ForeName": "Bert", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "G0801056", "Acronym": "MRC_", "Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "G1000758", "Acronym": "MRC_", "Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "MR/L01341X/1", "Acronym": "MRC_", "Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24517839", "10.3109/08958378.2013.861884"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
