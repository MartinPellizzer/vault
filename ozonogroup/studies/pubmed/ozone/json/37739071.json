High-concentration events are typically related to synoptic weather patterns, which impact the transport and photochemical production of ozone at multiple scales, ranging from the local to regional scale. To better understand the regional ozone pollution problem, studies on ozone source attribution are needed, especially regarding the contributions of sources at different vertical heights based on tagging the region or time periods. Between September 3 and 8, 2020, an episode of ozone concentration anomaly high was observed in Hefei through ground-based stations and ozone Lidar. The mechanism behind this event was uncovered through synoptic weather pattern analysis and using the Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry model (WRF-Chem). Because an approaching typhoon caused variable wind direction, the O<sub>3</sub>-rich air masses (ORMs) arising from the YRD region were transported to Hefei via the nocturnal residual layer and descended to the ground through horizontal advection and vertical mixing processes the next day. Based on geographic source tagging, the anthropogenic NOx emissions (ANEs) from local and regional sources were the main contributors to the heavy ozone pollution over Hefei on September 6. Furthermore, the intra-regional transported ozone from southern Jiangsu (SJS), southern Anhui (SAH), and Zhejiang (ZJ) in the YRD was the main driving factor of the surface and upper atmosphere ozone pollution. Based on time period tagging, The ozone generated due to ANEs from September 3 to 5 significantly contributed to this episode. It is important to pay attention to the impact of ANEs on September 5 on the surface peak ozone concentration the following day (i.e., September 6). Our findings provide significant insights into the regional ozone transport mechanism in the YRD and optimization of measures to prevent and control heavy ozone pollution on spatiotemporal scales."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
