Ozone pollution has significant adverse effects on ecosystems, human health, and climate change, particularly on crop growth and yield. This study utilized the observational hourly O<sub>3</sub> data, cumulative O<sub>3</sub> concentration over 40\u00a0ppb per h (AOT40), and the mean daytime 7-h O<sub>3</sub> concentration (M7) to analyze the spatiotemporal distributions of relative yield losses (RYLs) and evaluate the yield reduction and economic losses of rice in Sichuan province from 2015 to 2020. The results indicated that the average O<sub>3</sub> concentration during the growing rice season ranged from 55.4 to 69.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, with the highest O<sub>3</sub> concentration observed in 2017, and the AOT40 ranged from 4.5 to 8.7\u00a0ppm\u00a0h from 2015 to 2020. At the county level, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration, AOT40, and the relative yield loss (RYL) of rice based on AOT40 exhibited clear spatiotemporal differences in Sichuan. The RYLs of AOT40 were 4.9-9.2% from 2015 to 2020. According to AOT40 and M7 metrics, the yield loss and economic losses attributed to O<sub>3</sub> pollution amounted to 78.75-150.36 (9.74-21.54) ten thousand tons, and 2079.08-4149.89 (257.25-594.45) million Yuan, respectively. Rice yield and economic losses were relatively large in the Chengdu Plain, southern Sichuan, and northeast Sichuan. These findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the detrimental effects of elevated surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on rice crops. It is imperative to implement more stringent O<sub>3</sub> reduction measures aimed at lowering O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, enhancing rice quality, and safeguarding food security in Sichuan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
