The reaction network of two CIs with different functionality, <i>i.e.</i> acetaldehyde oxide (CH<sub>3</sub>CHOO) and glyoxal oxide (CHOCHOO) formed in the ozone-assisted oxidation reaction of crotanaldehyde (CA), is investigated over a temperature range between 390 K and 840 K in an atmospheric pressure jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at a residence time of 1.3 s, stoichiometry of 0.5 with a mixture of 1% crotonaldehyde, 10% O<sub>2</sub>, at an fixed ozone concentration of 1000 ppm and 89% Ar dilution. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry in conjunction with single photon tunable synchrotron vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) radiation is used to identify elusive intermediates by means of experimental photoionization energy scans and <i>ab initio</i> threshold energy calculations for isomer identification. Addition of ozone (1000 ppm) is observed to trigger the oxidation of CA already at 390 K, which is below the temperature where the oxidation reaction of CA was observed in the absence of ozone. The observed CA + O<sub>3</sub> product, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is found to be linked to a ketohydroperoxide (2-hydroperoxy-3-oxobutanal) resulting from the isomerization of the primary ozonide. Products corresponding to the CIs uni- and bi-molecular reactions were observed and identified. A network of CI reactions is identified in the temperature region below 600 K, characterized by CIs bimolecular reactions with species like aldehydes, <i>i.e.</i>, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and crotonaldehyde and alkenes, <i>i.e.</i>, ethene and propene. The region below 600 K is also characterized by the formation of important amounts of typical low-temperature oxidation products, such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), methyl hydroperoxide (CH<sub>3</sub>OOH), and ethyl hydroperoxide (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OOH). Detection of additional oxygenated species such as alcohols, ketene, and aldehydes are indicative of multiple active oxidation routes. This study provides important information about the initial step involved in the CIs assisted oligomerization reactions in complex reactive environments where CIs with different functionalities are reacting simultaneously. It provides new mechanistic insights into ozone-assisted oxidation reactions of unsaturated aldehydes, which is critical for the development of improved atmospheric and combustion kinetics models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA. denisia.popolan-vaida@ucf.edu."}], "LastName": "DeCecco", "ForeName": "Alec C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA. denisia.popolan-vaida@ucf.edu."}], "LastName": "Conrad", "ForeName": "Alan R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA. denisia.popolan-vaida@ucf.edu."}], "LastName": "Floyd", "ForeName": "Arden M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0216-9347"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Jasper", "ForeName": "Ahren W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1375-0797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA 94551, USA."}], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "Nils", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), ICARE, 1C Avenue de la Recherche Scientifique, 45071 Orl\u00e9ans Cedex 2, France."}], "LastName": "Dagaut", "ForeName": "Philippe", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA. denisia.popolan-vaida@ucf.edu."}], "LastName": "Moody", "ForeName": "Nath-Eddy", "Initials": "NE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7866-6505"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA. denisia.popolan-vaida@ucf.edu."}], "LastName": "Popolan-Vaida", "ForeName": "Denisia M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38980126", "10.1039/d4cp01942c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
