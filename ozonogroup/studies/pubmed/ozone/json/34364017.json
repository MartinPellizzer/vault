However, this relationship among pregnant women remains largely unknown.", "To evaluate the association between pregnancy air pollution exposure and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during the third trimester assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scales, respectively.", "We analyzed 1481 pregnant women from a cohort study in Seoul. Maternal exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and <10\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), as well as to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) for each trimester and the entire pregnancy was assessed at participant's residential address by land use regression models. We estimated the relative risk (RR) and corresponding confidence interval (CI) of the depressive and anxiety symptoms associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> using modified Poisson regression.", "In single-pollutant models, an IQR increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> during the second trimester was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (PM<sub>2.5</sub> RR\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.27; PM<sub>10</sub> RR\u00a0=\u00a01.13, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.23; NO<sub>2</sub> RR\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.29) after adjusting for relevant covariates. Similarly, an IQR increase in O<sub>3</sub> during the third trimester was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.18), while the IQR increase in O<sub>3</sub> during the first trimester was associated with a decreased risk (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.96).
