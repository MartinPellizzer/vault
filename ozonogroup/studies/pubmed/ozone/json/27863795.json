TiO<sub>2</sub>-rGO nanocomposite was prepared using the modified hydrothermal method and characterized by TEM and XPS before and after plasma process. The results indicated that the APAP degradation efficiency was significantly improved to 92% after 18min of discharge plasma treatment coupling 0.25gL<sup>-1</sup> TiO<sub>2</sub>-rGO 5%wt at 18kV, compared with the plasma alone and plasma combined with P25 TiO<sub>2</sub>. The degradation mechanism for APAP in this system was studied by investigating the effects of the operational variables (e.g. discharge voltage and pH value) and the amount of the generated active species; and the results showed that O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> yields were influenced notably by adding TiO<sub>2</sub>-rGO. Also, it was observed that, compared with unused TiO<sub>2</sub>-rGO, the photocatalytic performance of used TiO<sub>2</sub>-rGO declined after several recirculation times due to the further reduction of Graphene Oxide in plasma system. Finally, intermediate products were analyzed by UV-vis spectrometry and HPLC/MS, and possible transformation pathways were identified with the support of theoretically calculating the frontier electron density of APAP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
