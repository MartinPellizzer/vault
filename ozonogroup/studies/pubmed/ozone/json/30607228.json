A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia and S. mutans, were selected and the antibacterial capability of the compounds was tested by using direct contact agar diffusion test (DCT) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) evaluations. Differences between specific means were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Group means were compared using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (<i>P</i><0.05).", "O-zone gel reported inhibition zones which correspond to 33% and 43% of that achieved by the CHX agents. No inhibition of bacterial growth (MIC) on the Gram-positive strain by using O-zone gel was found and no antimicrobial effect (MBC) was observed by using O-zone gel on both Gram-negative and -positive strains.", "The new ozonated oil was a relatively moderate antiseptic. Gram-negative bacteria proved to be more sensitive to ozonized olive oil than Gram-positive ones. The ozonized olive oil demonstrated a lower antibacterial activity if compared to the CHX-based agents tested. <b>Key words:</b>Agar diffusion test, antibacterial activity, direct contact test, ozone, ozonized olive oil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Unit of Biochemistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietrocola", "ForeName": "Giampiero", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences - Section of Dentistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ceci", "ForeName": "Matteo", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences - Section of Dentistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Preda", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences - Section of Dentistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poggio", "ForeName": "Claudio", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences - Section of Dentistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colombo", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Exp Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101603132", "ISSNLinking": "1989-5488"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nogales CG, Ferrari PH, Kantorovich EO, Lage-Marques JL.
