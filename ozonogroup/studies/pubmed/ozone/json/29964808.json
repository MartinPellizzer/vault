The effect of industrial emissions on ambient VOC concentrations in the Jiangbei Industrial Zone in Nanjing was evaluated using the ambient VOCs measurements taken at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) during March 2017. The monitoring data showed that the sum of 92 measured VOCs (TVOCs) ranged from 10.3\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> to 200.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Some VOC species, such as ethylene, propene, benzene, styrene, and dichloromethane had abnormally high values. Positive matrix factorization model (PMF) was used to identify the main sources of VOCs. The results showed that industrial emissions on average accounted for 50.0% of TVOCs, while petrochemical industry, chemical industry, and paints & solvents use accounted for 14.9%, 19.3% and 15.8%, respectively. During a VOC pollution episode, the contribution of industrial emissions reached 74.9%. The direction of industrial sources was determined by combining the wind speed and wind direction data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology(CICAEET), Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology(CICAEET), Nanjing 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Intelligent Environmental Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., Nanjing 211800, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xing-Dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Sheng-Ao", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Environmental Monitoring Station, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964808", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201708254"]}}]}
