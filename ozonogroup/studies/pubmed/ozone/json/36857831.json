Despite decades of application, little seems to be known about formation of transformation products while employing different ozone- or <sup>\u2219</sup>OH-based treatment methods and their fate in biodegradation. In this study, we demonstrate that O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene (BTE), and benzoic acid (BA) leads to less hydroxylated aromatic transformation products compared to UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as reference system - this at a similar <sup>\u2219</sup>OH exposure and parent compound removal efficiency. Aerobic biodegradation tests after oxidation of 0.15\u00a0mM BA (12.6\u00a0mg\u00a0C\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> theoretical DOC) revealed that a less biodegradable DOC fraction >\u00a04\u00a0mg\u00a0C\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> was formed in both oxidative treatments compared to the BA control. No advantage of ozonation over UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment was observed in terms of mineralization capabilities, however, we detected less transformation products after oxidation and biodegradation using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Biodegradation of BA that was not oxidized was more complete with minimal organic residual. Overall, the study provides new insights into the oxidation of monocyclic aromatics and raises questions regarding the biodegradability of oxidation products, which is relevant for several treatment applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
