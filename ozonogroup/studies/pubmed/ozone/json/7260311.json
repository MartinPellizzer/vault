It is recognized that many organisms are insufficiently resistant to solar UV-B to withstand full summer sunlight and thus mechanisms which facilitate avoidance of solar UV-B exposure may have significance for the survival of sensitive species. There are many alternative pathways which would lead to avoidance of solar UV-B. We have investigated the dynamics of biological reactions to stimulated solar UV-B radiation in two small arthropods, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch and the aquatic copepod Cyclops serrulatus. Observations of positioning and rate of movement were made; a mathematical formalism was developed which assisted in interpretation of the observations. Our observations suggest that, although avoidance would mitigate increased solar UV-B effects, even organisms which specifically reduce their UV-B exposure would encounter additional stress if ozone depletion does occur."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barcelo", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calkins", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biophys J", "NlmUniqueID": "0370626", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3495"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arthropods"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Avoidance Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1976 Dec;24(6):587-93", "ArticleIdList": ["1019248"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7260311", "PMC1327381", "10.1016/S0006-3495(80)85026-0", "S0006-3495(80)85026-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
