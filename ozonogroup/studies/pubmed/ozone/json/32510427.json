An enhanced meta-modeling approach, polynomial functions based response surface modeling coupled with the sectoral linear fitting technique (pf-ERSM-SL), integrating a new differential method (DM), was proposed to break through the limitation. The pf-ERSM-SL with DM was applied for analysis of O<sub>3</sub> formation regime and real-time source contributions in July and October 2015 over the Pearl River Delta Region (PRD) of Mainland China. According to evaluations, the pf-ERSM-SL with DM was proven to be effective in source apportionment when the traditional sensitivity analysis was unsuitable for deriving the source contributions in the nonlinear system. After diagnosing the O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub>x</sub>-VOC relationships, O<sub>3</sub> formation in most regions of the PRD was identified as a distinctive NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime in July; in October, the initial VOC-limited regime was found at small emission reductions (less than 22-44%), but it will transit to NO<sub>x</sub>-limited when further reductions were implemented. Investigation of the source contributions suggested that NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were the dominated contributor when turning-off the anthropogenic emissions, occupying 85.41-94.90% and 52.60-75.37% of the peak O<sub>3</sub> responses in July and October respectively in the receptor regions of the PRD; NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from the on-road mobile source (NO<sub>x</sub>_ORM) in Guangzhou (GZ), Dongguan&Shenzhen (DG&SZ) and Zhongshan (ZS) were identified as the main contributors. Consequently, the reinforced control of NO<sub>x</sub>_ORM is highly recommended to lower the ambient O<sub>3</sub> in the PRD effectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
