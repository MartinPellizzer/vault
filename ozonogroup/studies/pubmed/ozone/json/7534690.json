Cress plants which received Cd wilted faster during O3 exposure and became a gray-green color by the end of a 6-hr O3 exposure. Those receiving O3 alone also wilted but were normal in color during wilting. Leaf water content (percentage) significantly declined in both O3 + Cd- and O3-treated plants. However, leaves after Cd + O3 exposure were severely dessicated and necrotic, whereas O3-treated plants recovered their water content completely but had some injury. Increased stomatal aperture in cress but not tomato before O3 exposure and significantly lower water content at 1 and 24 hr after the end of O3 exposure were associated with the higher Cd content of leaves before and subsequent to O3 exposure. These factors contributed to a greater injury and cell death observed in the leaves of combined cadmium-oxidant stress. Dielectric properties of Thlaspi arvense (field penny cress) leaves grown at continuous exposure to Cd and/or nickel (Ni) indicated that there were measurable differences between metal-containing vs control leaves with regard to bound/unbound water status. This indicated that there was more free water under metal stress, and that the bound water content significantly declined in the leaves of these plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Council of Canada, Institute for Biological Sciences, Ottawa, Ontario."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Czuba", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kraszewski", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment, Controlled"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7534690", "10.1016/0147-6513(94)90006-x", "0147-6513(94)90006-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
