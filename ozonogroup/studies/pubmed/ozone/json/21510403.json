Considering the absorption of O3, OClO, NO2, O4, BrO and the Ring effect, ozone slant column densities were retrieved using the zenith scattered sunlight as the light source. The results showed that there was no obvious \"ozone hole\" during the monitoring period, but ozone VCD (vertical column density) had greatly changed within short time scale, especially in middle December and early February. The analysis of passive DOAS and Brewer measurements of ozone VCD showed good agreement with the correlative coefficient of 0.863, while satellite board OMI measurements with the correlative coefficient of 0.840, which confirmed the validity of the monitoring of Passive DOAS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Polar Environment, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China. yuhanluo@mail.ustc.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yu-Han", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-Qing", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Lin-Gen", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chang-Gui", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Pin-Hua", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Fu-Qi", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Li-Guang", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21510403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
