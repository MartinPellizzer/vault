Rats were sampled on days 1 and 5 of each episode and 9 days after day 5 of episodes 1, 2, and 4. One hour before being euthanized each rat was injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine to label proliferating cells. Each 5-day episode showed a characteristic pattern of rapid shallow breathing (days 1 and 2), epithelial injury, and interstitial and intraluminal inflammation. In contrast, the neutrophil component of inflammation, tracheal substance P release, and cell proliferation became attenuated with each consecutive episode of exposure. Concurrent with this cyclic and attenuated response there was progressive hypercellularity and hyperplasia in all airways studied and a progressive remodeling present in the terminal bronchioles. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the cumulative distal airway lesion is at least in part the result of a depressed cell proliferative response to injury in these airways. This depressed cell proliferative response may be in part the result of diminished neutrophil inflammation and/or release of mitogenic neuropeptides in response to ozone-induced injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Cell Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. esschelegle@ucdavis.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "Edward S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walby", "ForeName": "William F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alfaro", "ForeName": "Mario F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Viviana J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Putney", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stovall", "ForeName": "Mary Y", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sterner-Kock", "ForeName": "Anja", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "Dallas M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "Charles G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12620366", "10.1016/s0041-008x(02)00026-1", "S0041008X02000261"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
