The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Photohydroionization\u2122 (PHI; RGF Environmental Group, Inc., Riviera, Beach, FL), a novel advanced oxidation technology, as a surface treatment to control L. monocytogenes on food-contact surfaces, sliced American cheese, and ready-to-eat (RTE) turkey. A five-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes was used to inoculate sample surfaces. Food-contact surfaces were exposed to ultraviolet and other oxidative gases produced by the PHI system for 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 120\u2009s and 5, 10, and 15\u2009min; cheese and turkey samples were treated for 30, 60, and 120\u2009s and 5\u2009min. For each matrix at each time point, seven samples were treated and enumerated by plating appropriate dilutions onto modified oxford medium and thin-agar-layer modified oxford medium. Results showed reductions (p<0.05) in L. monocytogenes: 4.37 log colony-forming units (CFU)/coupon on stainless steel after 15-min treatment. A 1.39 and 1.63 log CFU/sample after 120\u2009s and 2.16 and 2.52 log CFU/sample after 5\u2009min were seen on American cheese and ready-to-eat turkey, respectively. Lipid oxidation analyses performed on cheese and turkey samples indicated that PHI treatment did not affect (p>0.05) thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances values. This study demonstrates the efficacy of PHI treatment to reduce L. monocytogenes on stainless steel and RTE foods and may serve as a processing intervention to ensure safe production of food."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Science Institute and Department of Animal Sciences and Industry, Kansas State University , Manhattan, Kansas."}], "LastName": "Saini", "ForeName": "Jasdeep K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marsden", "ForeName": "James L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Getty", "ForeName": "Kelly J K", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fung", "ForeName": "Daniel Y C", "Initials": "DY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Foodborne Pathog Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101120121", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3141"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Stainless Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cheese"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fast Foods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Listeriosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stainless Steel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Turkeys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24444302", "10.1089/fpd.2013.1512"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
