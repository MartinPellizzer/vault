Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a promising alternative technology for recovering water from polluted surface water. In this study, the composition changes of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) in MBR and ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>)-MBR systems for polluted surface water treatment were investigated using Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis with unknown screening. The intense DOM ions within a mass-to-charge ratio range of 100-500 was detected, and 2340 molecular formulae from 5743 peaks were assigned to the two systems. The most abundant components were formulae with C, H, O, N, and CHO only classes. The highest formulae decrease including CHO, CHON, CHOS, and CHONS were attributed to the bio-carrier used in both systems. Results showed that bioprocess was the main contributor in the DOM reduction, and the integration of UV/O<sub>3</sub> into the MBR improved the DOM composition changes. Biodegradable components with low O/C ratio in the CHO and CHON classes remarkably increased in the UV/O<sub>3</sub>-MBR system. The integration of UV/O<sub>3</sub> as a polishing step in the recirculation stream of MBR system was effective in improve the DOM removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
