In view of TNT-removal rate and its constant, we find that the test with HCO(3)(-) or HCOO(-) or Cu(2+) results in lower TNT-removal rate and its constant than control test. Therefore, it may conclude that HCO(3)(-) or HCOO(-) and Cu(2+) has a potential to inhibit the efficacy of O(3)/H(2)O(2), and that their inhibitions increase with an order from HCOO(-) to Cu(2+) and to HCO(3)(-). However, Al(3+) is an exception, because it has a potential to improve the efficacy. When the two selected ions coexist, HCO(3)(-) and HCOO(-) inhibit the efficacy. The inhibition is greater than that of either one alone, and also greater than their sum, and thus the integrated effect of HCO(3)(-) and HCOO(-) follows the synergistic effect. The inhibition of Cu(2+) and HCOO(-) coexistence also is greater than that either alone, but smaller than their sum, and thus their integrated effect follows the independent effect. The integrated effect of Al(3+) and HCOO(-) follows the addition effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China. wuygal@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yaoguo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chenhui", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiuhua", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "118-96-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trinitrotoluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trinitrotoluene"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16263212", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.09.041", "S0304-3894(05)00585-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
