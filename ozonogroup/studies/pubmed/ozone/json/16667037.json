Plants, 26 days old, were exposed to 0.06 to 0.08 microliters per liter O(3) from 1000 to 1600 hours for 4 days in a controlled environment chamber. On day 5, plants were exposed to a 6-hour simulated inversion in which O(3) peaked at 0.12 microliters per liter. Net photosynthesis declined in response to O(3) but recovered to near control levels 3 days after the exposure ended. Rubisco activity and quantity in control potato foliage increased and then decreased during the 12-day interval of the study. In some experiments foliage studied was physiologically mature and Rubisco activity had peaked when O(3) exposure commenced. In those cases, O(3) accelerated the decline in Rubisco activity. When less mature foliage was treated with O(3), the leaves never achieved the maximal level of Rubisco activity observed in control foliage and also exhibited more rapid decline in initial and total activity. Percent activation of Rubisco (initial/total activity) was not affected significantly by treatment. Quantity of Rubisco decreased in concert with activity. The decrease in activities is most likely due to a decrease in available protein rather than a decrease in the percentage of Rubisco activated in vivo. The reduction in the quantity of Rubisco, an important foliar storage protein, could contribute to premature senescence associated with toxicity of this air pollutant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dann", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Dec;82(23):8024-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16593629"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Jan;69(1):58-62", "ArticleIdList": ["16662184"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Biochem. 1983;52:507-35", "ArticleIdList": ["6351728"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Sep;73(1):185-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16663173"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1985 Nov 1;230(4725):566-70", "ArticleIdList": ["17809689"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16667037", "PMC1062010", "10.1104/pp.91.1.427"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
