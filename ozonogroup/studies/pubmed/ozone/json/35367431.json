However, the pollution characteristics of particulate organic nitrates at mountain areas and the effects of anthropogenic pollutant transport remain poorly understood. In this study, field sampling and measurements were conducted at a high-elevation mountain site over North China Plain in winter and spring. Total five kinds of particulate organic nitrates in fine particles were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. The average total concentrations of particulate organic nitrates were 330\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0121\u00a0ng\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063\u00a0ng\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> in winter and spring. The monoterpene-derived organic nitrates were the dominant components in both seasons with their contribution higher than 70%, accounting for 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8% and 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0% in organic aerosols in winter and spring, respectively. The significantly higher levels of particulate organic nitrates in winter than spring was ascribed to the strong effects of mountain-valley breezes and coal combustion plumes. The increasing concentrations of NO<sub>x</sub> and particulate matters brought by the valley breeze at daytime facilitated the formation of MHN215, OAKN359, and OAHN361, while the rising SO<sub>2</sub> abundance and the sulfate aerosols transported by elevated emission sources affected the formation of MDCN247 at nighttime."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
