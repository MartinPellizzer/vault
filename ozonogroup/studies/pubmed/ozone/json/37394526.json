To investigate the reason for this difference, we analyzed the reaction rate using a diffusional reaction model, in which ozone is carried by micro spherical viruses to inactivate the target viruses. Using this model, we can evaluate the amount of ozone required to inactivate a virus based on the ct value. We found that inactivation in gas phase requires 10<sup>14</sup>-10<sup>15</sup> ozone molecules per virus virion, while the inactivation in aqueous phase requires 5\u00d710<sup>10</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>11</sup> ozone molecules. This implies that the efficiency in gas phase is 200-20,000 times lower than that in aqueous phase. This is not attributed to the lower probability of collision in gas phase than in aqueous phase. Rather, it may be due to the fact that the ozone and radicals generated by ozone react and subsequently dissipate. We proposed the diffusion of ozone into a spherical virus at a steady state and the decomposition reaction model through radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Japan Society for the Medical & Hygienic Use of Ozone."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "De Nora Permelec Ltd."}], "LastName": "Nishiki", "ForeName": "Yoshinori", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Japan Society for the Medical & Hygienic Use of Ozone."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maxell, Ltd."}], "LastName": "Imazu", "ForeName": "Tatsuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Japan Society for the Medical & Hygienic Use of Ozone."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emeritus professor of Setsunan University."}], "LastName": "Nakamuro", "ForeName": "Katsuhiko", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Japan Society for the Medical & Hygienic Use of Ozone."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shizuoka Professional University of Agriculture."}], "LastName": "Naitou", "ForeName": "Hirotaka", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emeritus professor of Fukui University."}], "LastName": "Aoki", "ForeName": "Koichi Jeremiah", "Initials": "KJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Microorg Control", "NlmUniqueID": "9918609780806676", "ISSNLinking": "2758-6391"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viruses"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37394526", "10.4265/jmc.28.2_43"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
