However, its quantitative impacts on radical concentrations and O<sub>3</sub> production were rarely studied in the coastal atmosphere. In this study, ambient concentrations of PAN, O<sub>3</sub>, and related species were simultaneously measured from October 5 to November 10, 2018 (autumn), and July 14 to August 24, 2019 (summer) at a rural coastal site in Qingdao, North China. The formation mechanism of PAN and its impact on in-situ O<sub>3</sub> production were explored with an observation-based chemical box model. Photochemical formation of PAN and O<sub>3</sub> was controlled by both NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs, and acetaldehyde and methylglyoxal were the main contributors to PAN formation. However, the sensitivities of PAN to precursors were larger than that of O<sub>3</sub> in autumn while smaller in summer, which was mainly caused by the rapid decomposition of PAN at high temperatures. Zero-out sensitivity simulation showed that PAN could either promote or inhibit the in-situ O<sub>3</sub> formation by affecting the radical chemistry. It tended to suppress O<sub>3</sub> production by competing with precursors and terminating radical chain reactions under low-NO<sub>x</sub> and low-RO<sub>x</sub> circumstances but enhanced O<sub>3</sub> production by supplying RO<sub>2</sub> radicals under conditions with sufficient NO<sub>x</sub>. This study provides some new complementary insights into the formation mechanism of PAN and its impacts on O<sub>3</sub> production, and has implications for the formulation of control policy to mitigate regional photochemical pollution in northern China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
