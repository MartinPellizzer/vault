Several outdoor air pollutants have been associated with asthma morbidity. Previous studies of the effects of short-term air pollution exposure have been limited by potential exposure misclassification and limited spatial and temporal resolution of asthma outcome measures.", "We aimed to assess the association of short-term air pollutant exposure with the use of short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) for asthma by monitoring the time and place of occurrence with electronic medication monitors.", "In a cohort of adults and children with asthma (n\u00a0=\u00a0287; 60% female), we deployed electronic medication monitors fitted to metered-dose inhalers to monitor SABA use, capturing the date, time and location of use. We assigned pollutant exposures based on each actuation's time and location (4-h mean measures for ozone and particulate matter of 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m or smaller (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)), assessed associations using generalized linear models and explored age-specific effects.", "Ambient ozone exposure was positively associated with SABA use (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Age-specific associations were identified (interaction p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), with a larger increase in SABA use for children (11.3%; 95% CI: 7.0%-18.2%) than adults (8.4%; 95% CI: 6.4%-11.0%) per IQR increase of ozone (16.8\u00a0ppb).", "These findings support existing evidence that short-term exposure to ozone can cause morbidity in individuals with asthma, and suggest that ozone exposures below the current U.S. EPA standard may be associated with increased SABA use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
