To protect public health, Chinese scientific communities and government agencies have striven to mitigate ozone pollution. However, makers of pollution mitigation policies rarely consider epidemiological research, and communication between epidemiological researchers and the government is poor. Therefore, this article reviews the current mitigation policies and the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from an epidemiological perspective and proposes recommendations for researchers and policy makers on the basis of epidemiological evidence. We review current nationwide ozone control measures for mitigating ozone pollution from four dimensions: the integration of ozone and particulate matter control, ozone precursors control, ozone control in different seasons, and regional cooperation on the prevention of ozone pollution. In addition, we present environmental and epidemiological evidence and propose recommendations and discuss relevant ozone metrics and the criteria values of the NAAQS. We finally conclude that the disease burden attributable to ozone exposure in China may be underestimated and that the epidemiological research regarding the health effects of integrating ozone and particulate matter control is insufficient. Furthermore, atmospheric volatile organic compounds are severely detrimental to health, and related control policies are urgently required in China. We recommend a greater focus on winter ozone pollution and conclude that the health benefits of regional cooperation on ozone control and prevention are salient. We argue that daily average ozone concentration may be a more biologically relevant ozone metric than those currently used by the NAAQS, and accumulating epidemiological evidence supports revision of the standards. This review provides new insight for ozone mitigation policies and related epidemiological studies in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
