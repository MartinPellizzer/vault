Combined with literature data, the cooking source profile containing 117 VOCs was established comprehensively, and the NMHCs emission factors were obtained. Based on the bottom-up research method, the volatile organic compounds emission inventory of cooking sources in Sichuan Province was established. The results showed that the oxygen and alkane groups were the most important components for Sichuan cuisine, barbecue, and canteen, and the total proportion of the two groups was greater than 75%. The main VOCs species were ethanol, formaldehyde, ethane, hexanal, ethylene, 1,3-butadiene, and acrolein. Oxygen-containing components contributed the most to OFP, followed by olefin. The major OFP contributors were formaldehyde, ethylene, ethanol, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, hexanal, etc. In 2019, the VOCs emissions and OFP values of cooking sources in Sichuan Province were 32kt and 141kt, respectively, accounting for approximately 5% of the anthropogenic VOCs emissions and OFP values in Sichuan Province. The VOCs emission from cooking may have an important contribution to ozone formation, which means more attention should be paid to cooking."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Chen-Xi", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hui", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610042, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35258193", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202104182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
