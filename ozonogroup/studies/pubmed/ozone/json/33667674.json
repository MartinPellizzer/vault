Here, we investigated the effects of NB-O<sub>3</sub> on the innate immunity of fish by monitoring the expression levels of nonspecific immune-related genes (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), heat-shock protein genes (HSP70, HSP90-\u03b1), and a bacteriolytic enzyme, C-type lysozyme, gene (LYZ) post-treatment with this technology. Following exposure to NB-O<sub>3</sub>, the different tissues of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were collected over time for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. The expression of all the genes evaluated in the gills, the head kidney, and the spleen of the NB-O<sub>3</sub> treated group was significantly up-regulated compared to that in the untreated control group. The expression levels were the highest (approx. 2 to 4-fold) at 15\u00a0min and 3\u00a0h post-exposure and then decreased from 6 to 24\u00a0h. These findings suggested that NB-O<sub>3</sub> could switch on the innate immunity genes of Nile tilapia. Thus, we hypothesized that the NB-O<sub>3</sub>-immune-activated fish would respond more effectively to subsequent bacterial infections, thereby improving survivability compared to that of untreated fish. To test this hypothesis, 3\u00a0h post NB-O<sub>3</sub> exposed fish and unexposed fish were challenged with a lethal dose of Streptococcus agalactiae. Interestingly, the survival rate of the NB-O<sub>3</sub> group was significantly higher than that of the non-treated controls, with a relative percent survival (RPS) of 60-70%. Together, these findings indicate, for the first time, that NB-O<sub>3</sub> may trigger the nonspecific defense system of the fish, thereby improving fish survivability during subsequent bacterial infections. This research identified another potential benefit of NB-O<sub>3</sub> in aquaculture for preventing infectious bacterial diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
