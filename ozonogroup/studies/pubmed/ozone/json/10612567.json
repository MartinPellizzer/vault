However, the effects of Bakumondo-to on airway hyperresponsiveness are unknown. We examine whether Bakumondo-to can inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone.", "Measurements of airway responsiveness and plasma extravasation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed before and after ozone exposure (3 p.p.m., 2 h). Guinea-pigs were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and mechanically ventilated. Airway responsiveness was determined by an inhalation of doubling concentration of histamine, and the concentration of histamine required to produce a 200% increase in R(L) (PC200) was calculated by log-linear interpolation. Plasma extravasation was evaluated by measuring the extravasation of Evans blue dye in the airway.", "Ozone produced significant airway hyperresponsiveness and plasma extravasation, with an influx of neutrophils in BAL fluid. Bakumondo-to (400 mg/kg p.o.) significantly inhibited airway hyperresponsiveness, but had no effect on neutrophil influx or plasma extravasation.", "We demonstrated that Bakumondo-to can attenuate airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone without affecting airway inflammation, which suggests that Bakumondo-to may act on the subsequent mechanisms after the induction of inflammation, such as mediator release."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Institute, National Fukuoka-Higashi Hospital, Koga, Japan. aizawa@fukuokae.hosp.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aizawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shigyo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Respirology", "NlmUniqueID": "9616368", "ISSNLinking": "1323-7799"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10612567", "10.1046/j.1440-1843.1999.00203.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
