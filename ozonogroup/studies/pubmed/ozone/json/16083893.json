Uniform micrometer-sized polystyrene/crosslinked poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) composite particles were formed by a single-step swelling process of the template particles with styrene, divinyl benzene and benzoyl peroxide, followed by polymerization at 70 degrees C. Uniform micrometer-sized crosslinked poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) particles of higher surface area were produced by dissolution of the template polystyrene part of the former composite particles with N,N-dimethylformamide. Hydroperoxide conjugated crosslinked poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) particles were produced by ozonolysis of these particles. The effect of ozonolysis conditions, such as exposure time and flow rate of the ozone, on the hydroperoxide conjugation to the crosslinked particles was also studied. Functionalization of the crosslinked poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) particles was performed by graft polymerization of vinylic monomers such as acrylonitrile and chloromethylstyrene on the hydroperoxide conjugated crosslinked particles. This was accomplished by raising the temperature (e.g., 70 degrees C) of deairated acetonitrile dispersions containing the hydroperoxide conjugated particles and the vinylic monomers. The influence of various polymerization parameters on the grafting yield, e.g., monomer concentration, conjugated hydroperoxide concentration, and temperature, was also elucidated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel. ch190@mail.biu.ac.il"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Partouche", "ForeName": "Eran", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waysbort", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margel", "ForeName": "Shlomo", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Colloid Interface Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0043125", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9797"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16083893", "10.1016/j.jcis.2005.07.007", "S0021-9797(05)00758-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
