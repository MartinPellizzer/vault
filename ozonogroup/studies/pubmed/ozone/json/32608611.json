Although their combustion is an important source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), study on their emission characteristics is relatively weak. In this study, three kinds of wood (poplar, cedarwood, and citrus branches) and six economic crop straws (soybean stalk, sesame stalk, corn cob, cotton stalk, peanut stalk, and corn stalk) were selected and their burning was simulated in the laboratory. A dilution tunnel system was used to dilute the smoke, and then Tedlar bags were used to collect the smoke. The compositions of 102 VOCs were analyzed by Agilent 7820A/5977E gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs for different types of biomass burning was analyzed. The results indicated that there are differences in the VOC compositions of different types of biomass burning emissions. Ethane (11.1%), trans-2-pentene (15.4%), ethylene (8.3%), and dichloromethane (11.9%) are the main VOCs emitted from poplar and cedarwood burning. Toluene (49.8%) is the most abundant species of VOC emitted from burning of citrus branches. Ethylene (11.8%-17.5%) and acetone (9.2%-14.7%) are the main VOCs components of straw burning. Corn stalks, peanut stalks, and citrus branches have similar VOC source profiles, with the coefficient of divergence less than 0.1. The benzene/toluene ratio for biomass burning emissions obtained in this study and in the literature is in the range of 0.030-6.48. It is arguable that a value higher than 1 indicated the impact of biomass burning. The contributions of alkenens, oxygenated VOCs, and aromatic hydrocarbons to the OFP of biomass burning were 30.6%-80.3%, 6.5%-21.0%, and 3.8%-56.5%, respectively. The components contributing more than 10.0% to the OFP are ethylene, propylene, trans-2-pentene, cis-2-pentene, toluene, and propionaldehyde."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Zhen-Zhen", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Shao-Fei", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Shu-Rui", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Huang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Li-Quan", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fang-Qi", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Si", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Shi-Hua", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608611", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201909071"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
