The instrument has several features that distinguish it from former UV absorption instruments, all of which contribute to a smaller size and much lower power consumption while retaining the advantages of the UV measurement technique. A novel airflow system and advanced electronics are among the most important changes from earlier reported systems. The instrument fits into a package 10 cm in diameter by 60 cm long and weighs under 1.5 kg. Hence, it is well-suited for lightweight airborne applications using kites and balloons, as well as other portable measurement needs. Independent measurements of ozone are made every 4 s, with a sensitivity of 0.3 ppbv ozone (limit of detection for S/N = 3) and a precision of \u00b12%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0216."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bognar", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birks", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21619375", "10.1021/ac9604189"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
