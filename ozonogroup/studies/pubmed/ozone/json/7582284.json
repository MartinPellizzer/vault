Ozone and particulates were monitored at an adjacent government station, in the school yard, and under the tarp. Subjects were selected to oversample children with chronic respiratory symptoms, although children with active asthma under regular medication or FEV1 < 80% predicted were excluded. Of the participants, 21 had chronic cough, chronic phlegm, or ever wheeze with colds or apart from colds. Children performed two cycles of treadmill exercise (15 min) and rest (15 min) for a total of 1 h of intermittent exercise. Most subjects attained the target minute ventilation of 35 L/min/m2. Subjects exercised alternately during low ozone hours (8:00-10:00 A.M.) and during peak O3 hours (12:00-2:00 P.M.), to assure a range of exposures. On 85% of exercise days, the maximum daily 1-h average for ambient O3 exceeded the Mexican guideline of 110 parts per billion (ppb). O3 exposure during the hour of exercise was divided into quintiles, and the response was adjusted for repeated measures, subject having a cold, and prior outdoor exercise. Ambient O3 in the fifth quintile (mean = 229 ppb) was associated with a percentage change in FVC (-1.43% +/- 0.70), FEV1 (-2.85% +/- 0.79), FEF25-75% (-6.32 +/- 1.87) and FEV1 (-1.41% +/- 0.46).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana-Xochimilco (UAM-X), Mexico City, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castillejos", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gold", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Damokosh", "ForeName": "A I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Serrano", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonnell", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dockery", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruiz Velasco", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Common Cold"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Sounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7582284", "10.1164/ajrccm.152.5.7582284"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
