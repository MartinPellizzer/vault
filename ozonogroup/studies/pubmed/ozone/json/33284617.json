Complex organic nitrogenous compounds, nitrosamine precursors, are largely unidentified in source water. Using stable isotopic labeling-enhanced nontargeted analysis, we identified a natural product <i>N</i>-heterocyclic amine 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (MTCCA) in source water. Interestingly, we discovered that chloramination of MTCCA-containing water could produce four nitrosamines: methylethylnitrosamine, <i>N</i>-nitrosopyrrolidine, <i>N</i>-nitrosoanatabine, and <i>N</i>-nitrosoanabasine. Computational modeling and experimental results helped explain potential pathways of nitrosamines generated from chloramination of MTCCA. Further investigations confirmed widespread occurrence of MTCCA in source water and wastewater. Its concentration ranged from high in upstream creeks (23.2-332.2 ng L<sup>-1</sup>) to low in the river (5.7-37.6 ng L<sup>-1</sup>) during the 2020 spring runoffs, indicating that sources of MTCCA came from creeks around farms. Analysis of wastewater before and after ultraviolet, as well as microfiltration with subsequent ozonation treatments, showed increased MTCCA after treatments, demonstrating a difficulty to degrade and remove MTCCA in water. This study discovered the extensive presence of MTCCA in source water and wastewater, suggesting that natural <i>N</i>-heterocyclic compounds may serve as a new source of nitrosamine precursors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Junlang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Craven", "ForeName": "Caley", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhongshan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2156-8167"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Institute of Environmental Health and Pollution Control, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Yanpeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1844-7700"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xing-Fang", "Initials": "XF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33284617", "10.1021/acs.est.0c06109"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
