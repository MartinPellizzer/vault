For this purpose, size distribution and structural (resin) fractionation tools have recently been proposed to categorize wastewater. There are several case studies available in the scientific literature being devoted to the application of these fractionation methods. This paper aimed to review the most relevant studies dealing with the evaluation of changes in wastewater characteristics using size distribution and structural (resin) fractionation tools. According to these studies, sequential filtration-ultrafiltration procedures, as well as XAD resins, are frequently employed for size and structural fractionations, respectively. This review focuses on the most relevant publications including biological treatment processes, as well as chemical treatment methods such as coagulation-flocculation, electrocoagulation, the Fenton's reagent and ozonation. This study aims at providing an insight into the possible treatment mechanisms and details the understanding what structural features of wastewater components enabled or prevented efficient treatment (removal) or targeted pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Political Science, Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Marmara University, 34820 Beykoz, Istanbul, Turkey E-mail: hande.gursoy@marmara.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Gursoy-Haksevenler", "ForeName": "B Hande", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering, Department of Environmental Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, 34469 Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Arslan-Alaton", "ForeName": "Idil", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33031062", "10.2166/wst.2020.403"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
