These subjects comprised the second cohort of fourth grade children participating in the Children's Health Study. Significant deficits in lung function growth rate were associated with exposure to acid vapor, NO(2), particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microm (PM(2.5)), and elemental carbon. For example, the average annual growth rates of maximal midexpiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were reduced by approximately 11% (p = 0.005) and 5% (p = 0.03), respectively, across the observed range of acid exposure. Exposure to acid vapor was also associated with reductions in the ratio of maximal midexpiratory flow to forced vital capacity (p = 0.02), whereas exposure to ozone was correlated with reduced growth in peak flow rate (p = 0.006). Larger deficits in lung function growth rate were observed in children who reported spending more time outdoors. These findings provide important replication of our previous findings of an effect of air pollution on lung function growth that were based on the first fourth-grade cohort from the Children's Health Study (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;162:1383-1390)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA. jimg@usc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gauderman", "ForeName": "W James", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilliland", "ForeName": "G Frank", "Initials": "GF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vora", "ForeName": "Hita", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avol", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stram", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McConnell", "ForeName": "Rob", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Duncan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lurmann", "ForeName": "Fred", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margolis", "ForeName": "Helene G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rappaport", "ForeName": "Edward B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berhane", "ForeName": "Kiros", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peters", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "SP30ES07048-06", "Acronym": "SP", "Agency": "CSAP SAMHSA HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12091175", "10.1164/rccm.2111021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
