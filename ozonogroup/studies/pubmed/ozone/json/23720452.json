The aim was to provide a better understanding of the workers' exposure to facilitate the evaluation of short-term effects on cardiovascular health endpoints. To quantify the workers' exposure, we monitored 18 subjects during 50 non-consecutive work shifts. Exposure assessment was based on personal and work site measurements and included fine particulate matter (PM2.5), particle number concentration (PNC), noise (Leq), and the gaseous co-pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Mean work shift PM2.5 concentrations (gravimetric measurements) ranged from 20.3 to 321 \u03bcg m(-3) (mean 62 \u03bcg m(-3)) and PNC were between 1.6\u00d710(4) and 4.1\u00d710(5) particles cm(-3) (8.9\u00d710(4) particles cm(-3)). Noise levels were generally high with Leq over work shifts from 73.3 to 96.0 dB(A); the averaged Leq over all work shifts was 87.2 dB(A). The highest exposure to fine and ultrafine particles was measured during grass mowing and lumbering when motorized brush cutters and chain saws were used. Highest noise levels, caused by pneumatic hammers, were measured during paving and guardrail repair. We found moderate Spearman correlations between PNC and PM2.5 (r = 0.56); PNC, PM2.5, and CO (r = 0.60 and r = 0.50) as well as PNC and noise (r = 0.50). Variability and correlation of parameters were influenced by work activities that included equipment causing combined air pollutant and noise emissions (e.g. brush cutters and chain saws). We conclude that highway maintenance workers are frequently exposed to elevated airborne particle and noise levels compared with the average population. This elevated exposure is a consequence of the permanent proximity to highway traffic with additional peak exposures caused by emissions of the work-related equipment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Work and Health [Institut universitaire romand de Sant\u00e9 au Travail], University of Lausanne and University of Geneva, Route de la Corniche 2, CH-1066 Epalinges - Lausanne, Switzerland;"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meier", "ForeName": "Reto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cascio", "ForeName": "Wayne E", "Initials": "WE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Danuser", "ForeName": "Brigitta", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riediker", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Occup Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "0203526", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4878"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Construction Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ear Protective Devices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maintenance"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Noise"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23720452", "10.1093/annhyg/met018", "met018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
