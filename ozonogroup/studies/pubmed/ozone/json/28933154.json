In particular, we have demonstrated that the cellulose filter paper treated with a binary hexane solution of short (methyltrichlorosilane) and long (octadecyltrichlorosilane) organosilanes exhibits remarkably high water contact angles (>150\u00b0) and low wetting hysteresis (\u223c10\u00b0). Beyond the optimized ratio between the two organosilanes, we have discovered that the thickness rather than the pore size dictates the resulting superhydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that silanization does not damage the cellulose microfibers; instead, they are coated with uniform, particulate nanostructures, which should contribute to the observed surface properties. The modified filter paper is chemically stable and mechanically durable; it can be readily patterned with UV/ozone treatment to create hydrophilic regions to prepare chemical assays for colorimetric pH and nitrite detections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University , Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lishen", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University , Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Kwok", "ForeName": "Honoria", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Transducers and Intelligent Control Systems (Ministry of Education and Shanxi Province), College of Physics and Optoelectronics, Taiyuan University of Technology , Taiyuan, Shanxi 030024, P.
