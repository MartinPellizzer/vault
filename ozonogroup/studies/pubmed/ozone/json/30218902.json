It could be found that FeOOH prepared from ferric sulfate performed higher activity. Subsequently, the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, scanning electron microscope and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption techniques. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer showed that the synthesized FeOOH consisted of \u03b1-FeOOH and \u03b2-FeOOH mainly. Scanning electron microscope showed that their appearance and morphology were significantly different, and the FeOOH prepared from ferric sulfate had a larger specific surface area, resulting in its better catalytic activity. Finally, the hydroxyl groups and pH<sub>zpc</sub> of the catalyst surface were measured. It was also found that the FeOOH prepared from ferric sulfate owned more hydroxyl groups and the pH<sub>zpc</sub> of the surface was closer to the pH of the degradation substrate, which illustrated the reasons for the increased catalytic activity. In addition, the degradation kinetics conformed to the pseudo first-order kinetic model and the hydroxyl radicals played an important role in the reaction process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
