By using therapeutic agents, early, noncavitated lesions and caries limited to the enamel can be stopped or even remineralized. For the remineralization of the initial carious lesion, many nonfluoridated remineralizing agents were investigated.", "An observational study to assess the remineralizing efficacy of tricalcium phosphate (TCP), nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) and ozone remineralizing agents on the artificial carious lesion.", "In this observational research, the artificial carious lesion was produced on extracted 40 premolar teeth. Later, remineralizing agents (Group A: nHAp, Group B: TCP, Group C: Ozone remineralizing agents, Group D: Control group (Deionized water) were used to remineralize demineralized teeth. Utilizing the Vickers Hardness Number, the level of demineralization and remineralization was assessed. Later these readings were statistically assessed using the Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) and ANOVA tests in SPSS version 21.0. The P value was set at 0.05 or less.", "After demineralization, there was a decrease in enamel microhardness values, with 32% in Group A, 26% in Group B, 22% in Group C, and 21% in Group D, respectively. From the baseline to demineralization, there was a statistically significant decrease in microhardness across all groups. After remineralization, Groups A, B, and C experienced an increase in microhardness while Group D experienced no changes. This showed that Group A had the highest remineralization percentage, followed by Group B and Group C.", "nHAp and TCP had the greater remineralizing ability, which can be used to manage initial carious lesions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Indian Journal of Dental Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, College of Dentistry, Ar Rass College of Applied Health Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Shahzad Ali", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Swami Devi Dyal Hospital and Dental College, Panchakula, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Mehak", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, College of Dentistry, Ar Rass College of Applied Health Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Prabu Mahin Syed", "Initials": "PMS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Sharavathi Dental College and Hospital, Shimogaa, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Babaji", "ForeName": "Prashant", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, Nitte (Deemed to be University), AB Shetty Memorial Institute of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Azhar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dentistry, Shri Guru Ram Rai Institute of Medical and Health Sciences, Dehradun, India."}], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Bhavna", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Kusum Devi Sunderlal Dugar Jain Dental College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Mandal", "ForeName": "Ananyo", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Dent Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9202990", "ISSNLinking": "0970-9290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K4C08XP666", "NameOfSubstance": "tricalcium phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91D9GV0Z28", "NameOfSubstance": "Durapatite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Remineralization"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Durapatite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicuspid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abou Neel EA, Aljabo A, Strange A, Ibrahim S, Coathup M, Young AM, et al.
