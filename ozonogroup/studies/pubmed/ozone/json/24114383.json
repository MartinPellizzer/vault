Maize (Zea mays L.), a C4 plant is the third most important staple crop at global level with a great deal of economic importance. The present study was conducted to evaluate the performance of two maize cultivars [HQPM1: quality protein maize (QPM)] and [DHM117: nonquality protein maize (NQPM)] to variable O3 doses. Experimental setup included filtered chambers, nonfiltered chambers (NFC), and two elevated doses of O3 viz. NFC+15 ppb O3 (NFC+15) and NFC+30 ppb O3 (NFC+30). During initial growth period, both QPM and NQPM plants showed hormetic effect that is beneficial due to exposure of low doses of a toxicant (NFC and NFC+15 ppb O3), but at later stages, growth attributes were negatively affected by O3. Growth indices showed the variable pattern of photosynthate translocation under O3 stress. Foliar injury in the form of interveinal chlorosis and reddening of leaves due to increased production of anthocyanin pigments was observed at higher concentrations of O3. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis of leaves taken from NFC+30 showed reductions of major photosynthetic proteins, and differential response was observed between the two test cultivars. Decline in the number of male flowers at elevated O3 doses suggested damaging effect of O3 on reproductive structures which might be a cause of productivity losses. Variable carbon allocation pattern particularly to husk leaves, foliar injury, and damage of photosynthetic proteins led to significant reductions in economic yield at higher O3 doses. PCA showed that both the cultivars responded more or less similarly to O3 stress in their respective groupings of growth and yield parameters, but magnitude of their response was variable. It is further supported by difference in the significance of correlations between variables of yield and AOT40. Cultivar response reflects that QPM performed better than NQPM against elevated O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India, abha2512.singh@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Aditya Abha", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shahi", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1999 Aug;120(4):1015-24", "ArticleIdList": ["10444084"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Biol (Stuttg). 2007 Jul;9(4):478-88", "ArticleIdList": ["17401809"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Biol (Stuttg). 2011 Jan;13(1):93-104", "ArticleIdList": ["21143730"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 May 7;72:248-54", "ArticleIdList": ["942051"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2000 Sep;109(3):517-24", "ArticleIdList": ["15092885"]}, {"Citation": "Biol Res. 2007;40(2):137-53", "ArticleIdList": ["18064351"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2009 Aug-Sep;157(8-9):2359-67", "ArticleIdList": ["19386404"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2008 Dec 15;407(1):679-91", "ArticleIdList": ["18962826"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1996;94(1):53-60", "ArticleIdList": ["15093517"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Monit. 2006 Jan;8(1):25-32", "ArticleIdList": ["16395456"]}, {"Citation": "Electrophoresis. 2007 Dec;28(23):4369-81", "ArticleIdList": ["17987633"]}, {"Citation": "J Proteome Res. 2008 Jul;7(7):2980-98", "ArticleIdList": ["18517257"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1995 Oct;109(2):421-432", "ArticleIdList": ["12228603"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2010 Feb;161(1-4):205-15", "ArticleIdList": ["19184480"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Manage. 2012 Mar;95 Suppl:S19-24", "ArticleIdList": ["21788100"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2005 Feb 1;202(3):289-301", "ArticleIdList": ["15667834"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2005 Apr;134(3):385-95", "ArticleIdList": ["15620584"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24114383", "10.1007/s11356-013-2188-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
