We studied healthy 6-month-old New Zealand rabbits weighing 3.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202fkg (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD, n\u202f=\u202f8). Pulmonary hypertension was induced by chemically increasing right ventricular systolic pressure to 28-30\u202fmmHg. The mini-NO generator was placed near the endotracheal tube. Production of NO was triggered by a pediatric airway flowmeter during the first 0.5\u202fs of inspiration.", "In rabbits with acute pulmonary hypertension, the mini-NO generator produced sufficient NO to induce pulmonary vasodilation. Potentially toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were removed by the Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> scavenger. Metallic particles, released from the electrodes by the electric plasma, were removed by a 0.22\u202f\u03bcm filter. While producing 40\u202fppm NO, the mini-NO generator was cooled by a flow of air (70\u202fml/min) and the external temperature of the housing did not exceed 31\u202f\u00b0C.", "The mini-NO generator safely produced therapeutic levels of NO from air. The mini-NO generator is an effective and economical approach to producing NO for treating neonatal pulmonary hypertension and will increase the accessibility and therapeutic uses of life-saving NO therapy worldwide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
