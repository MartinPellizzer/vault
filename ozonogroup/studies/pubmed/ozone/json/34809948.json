Granny Smith apples were inoculated with or without Listeria innocua, treated with or without 1.0\u00a0mg/L 1-MCP for 24\u00a0h, then subjected to commercial cold storage conditions including refrigerated air (RA, 0.6\u00a0\u00b0C, control), controlled atmosphere (CA, 2% O<sub>2</sub>, 1% CO<sub>2,</sub> 0.6\u00a0\u00b0C), and CA with 51-87\u00a0\u03bcg/L ozone gas for up to 36 weeks. RA storage reduced L. innocua on apples by up to 3.6 log<sub>10</sub>\u00a0CFU/apple. CA had no advantage over RA in controlling Listeria. Continuous ozone gas application resulted in an additional \u223c2.0 log<sub>10</sub>\u00a0CFU/apple reduction of L. innocua (total reduction up to 5.7 log<sub>10</sub>\u00a0CFU/apple) and suppressed native bacteria and fungi. Treatment with 1-MCP had a minor impact on survival of L. innocua or background microbiota on apples, while it significantly delayed fruit ripening and reduced the incidence of superficial scald and internal browning. In summary, 1-MCP treatment followed by CA storage with low-dose continuous ozone gas can effectively control Listeria on fresh apples and delay fruit ripening."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
