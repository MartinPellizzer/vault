Batch experiments, in which ozone-containing gas was continuously recycled through a soil bed, were conducted to quantify the rate of ozone self-decomposition and the rates of ozone interaction with soil organic and inorganic matter. Column experiments were conducted to measure ozone breakthrough from a soil column. Parameters such as ozone flow rate, soil mass, and ozonation time were varied in these experiments. After ozone concentration had reached steady state, the total organic carbon concentration was measured for all soil samples. The ozonation efficiency, represented by the ratio of soil organic matter consumed to the total ozone input, was quantified for each experiment. Numerical simulations were conducted to simulate experimentally obtained column breakthrough curves. Experimentally obtained kinetic rate constants were used in these simulations, and the results were in good agreement with experimental data. In contrast to previous studies in which soil inorganic matter was completely ignored, our experiments indicate that soil inorganic matter may also promote depletion of ozone, thus reducing the overall ozonation efficiency. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to predict the efficacy of ozonation for soil remediation in the field. These simulations indicate that such ozonation can be very effective, provided that effective circulation of ozone is achieved through appropriately placed wells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, Georgia Institute of Technology, 200 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332-0512, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Won-Tae", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garanzuay", "ForeName": "Xandra", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yiacoumi", "ForeName": "Sotira", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsouris", "ForeName": "Costas", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Baohua", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mahinthakumar", "ForeName": "G Kumar", "Initials": "GK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Contam Hydrol", "NlmUniqueID": "8805644", "ISSNLinking": "0169-7722"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inorganic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inorganic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15240174", "10.1016/j.jconhyd.2003.11.003", "S0169-7722(03)00237-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
