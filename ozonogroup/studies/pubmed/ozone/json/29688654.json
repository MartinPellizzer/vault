The effects of the vacuum annealing and ultraviolet (UV) ozone (O\u2083) exposure of the bare graphene films prior to the thermal evaporation on the SnO(x) -Sn films\u2019 sensitivities, bonding states, and surface morphologies were investigated. With increasing annealing time, the coverage of the SnO(x) -Sn nanoparticles on the graphene increased and the p to n sensitivity transition occurred when n-type SnO(x) -Sn nanoparticles became dominant instead of the p-type graphene films for sensors without O\u2083 exposure. Meanwhile, the opposite p-type sensitivity response was dominant with increasing annealing time for the O\u2083-treated sensors. The chemisorbed Sn on the graphene generated by O\u2083 exposure was oxidized by highly reactive NO\u2082, resulting in a p-type doping effect, which would lead to n- to p-type sensitivity transition when the hole concentration exceeded the initial electron concentration of the n-type SnO(x) -Sn compound films. Vacuum annealing and O\u2083 exposure also exhibited a tremendous influence on the SnO(x) -Sn films\u2019 surface morphologies, which could be responsible for the subsequent sensitivity dependence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Haichuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Keke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Haifen", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29688654", "10.1166/jnn.2017.12618"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
