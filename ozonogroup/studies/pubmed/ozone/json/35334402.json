This paper investigates whether the government's call for night refueling, which can be regarded as a green nudge, can guide changes in consumer behavior and consequently improve environmental quality. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation and weekly monitoring site air quality panel data, we analyze the effect of the Night Refueling Preferential Policy on O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. We find that the policy can reduce O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 10% by encouraging consumers to refuel at night. The reduction in O<sub>3</sub> has brought great benefits to human health, leading to a 4-5\u2030 reduction in non-accidental mortality and a 6-8\u2030 reduction in cardiovascular mortality in Jiangsu province. The economic benefits of this policy would be approximately 62-189 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY) if it were implemented nationwide. The findings of this study suggest that the government can influence consumer behavior to promote environmental quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
