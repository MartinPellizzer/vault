Our hypothesis was that, as part of a defense mechanism against oxygen toxicity, such cells would have increased levels of glutathione (GSH) in response to an oxidant stress. Female F344/N rats were exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone, 6 hr/day, for 1, 3, or 7 days, after which cells were collected by lung lavage. The GSH and GSH-peroxidase activity per milligram of protein in the cellular fraction, both necessary for reducing cellular peroxides, were elevated after 3 days of ozone exposure. After 7 days of exposure, cellular GSH had returned to control values, but the activity of glutathione reductase, the enzyme that reduces oxidized glutathione to GSH, was increased. Extracellular GSH concentration and glutathione reductase activity in BALF were also increased after 7 days of exposure. The total glutathione equivalents (GSH and GSSG, both cellular and extracellular) in BALF increased throughout the 7-day exposure, with GSH increasing first in the cells, and then in the extracellular fluid. This study demonstrated that the glutathione anti-oxidant system of BALF cells is stimulated by exposure to ozone. This response may serve to protect cells from the toxic effects of oxidant stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boehme", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hotchkiss", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES04282", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Exp Mol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370711", "ISSNLinking": "0014-4800"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ULW86O013H", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Disulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Disulfide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1547867", "10.1016/0014-4800(92)90021-3", "0014-4800(92)90021-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
