We have recently discovered that the \"Hard Coat\" film of Verbatim BDs is in fact a unique type of polymeric substrates that can be readily activated and adapted for biochip fabrications. Particularly, the Hard Coat film peeled from BDs is optically transparent without any fluorescence background, which can be activated by treating with a common base (1.0 M NaOH) at a slightly elevated temperature (55 \u00b0C). The surface density of reactive carboxylic acid groups generated, 6.6 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10<sup>-9</sup> mol/cm<sup>2</sup>, is much higher than that on polycarbonate upon UV/ozone irradiation (4.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10<sup>-10</sup> mol/cm<sup>2</sup>). There are no significant physical damages to the substrate morphology, and the aging effect is minimal. More importantly, the BD substrate can be patterned using either cut-out filter paper masks or microfluidic channel plates; both are lithography-free, bench-top methods that facilitate the device fabrication in a common laboratory setting. With classical biotin-streptavidin binding and DNA hybridization arrays as trial systems, we have also demonstrated this new type of biochip substrates for quantitative assay applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , British Columbia V5A 1S6 , Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering , Southeast University , Nanjing , Jiangsu 210096 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Light Industry and Food Engineering , Nanjing Forestry University , Nanjing , Jiangsu 210037 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Lanling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , British Columbia V5A 1S6 , Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering , Taiyuan University of Technology , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030024 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lingling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering , Southeast University , Nanjing , Jiangsu 210096 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8926-7710"], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Zhong-Ze", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering , Taiyuan University of Technology , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030024 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaochun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering , Southeast University , Nanjing , Jiangsu 210096 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Xuejun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , British Columbia V5A 1S6 , Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biomedical Engineering , Taiyuan University of Technology , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030024 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1411-3156"], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hua-Zhong", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "6SO6U10H04", "NameOfSubstance": "Biotin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9013-20-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptavidin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biotin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microchip Analytical Procedures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Printing"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Streptavidin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31525871", "10.1021/acsami.9b13268"]}}]}
