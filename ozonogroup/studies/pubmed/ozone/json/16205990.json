The effluents were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and were fractionated into three fractions based on polarities. The battery of bioassays was performed for each fraction. In the battery, the toxicities of the effluents were described according to their modes of actions (MOA) or biomarkers and the properties of the toxic chemicals were categorized by their polarities and MOAs. The proposed procedure could be used as a tool to diagnose the toxic characteristics of the complicate mixture. The results showed that cytotoxic, dioxin-like and estrogenic chemicals could be detected in all samples. In the influent, cytotoxic and dioxin-like chemicals were mainly in polar fraction and estrogenic chemicals were in non-polar and moderate-polar fractions. The secondary treatment (active sludge) could remove a small amount of these toxicants. Among different types of advanced treatments, flocculation was good enough to remove most of the cytotoxic chemicals and a combination of flocculation, ozone oxidation, and post-biological treatment could eliminate most of the dioxin-like and estrogenic chemicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.
