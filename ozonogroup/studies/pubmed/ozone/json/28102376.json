The most efficient catalysts employed for this reaction at room temperature are SnO<sub>2</sub>-based, in particular the Ni/Sb-SnO<sub>2</sub> catalyst. In order to investigate the H<sub>2</sub>O splitting mechanism density functional theory (DFT) was performed on a Ni/Sb-SnO<sub>2</sub> surface with oxygen vacancies. By calculating different SnO<sub>2</sub> facets, the (110) facet was deemed most stable, and further doped with Sb and Ni. On this surface, the H<sub>2</sub>O splitting mechanism was modelled paying particular attention to the final two steps, the formation of O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Previous studies on \u03b2-PbO<sub>2</sub> have shown that the final step in the reaction (the formation of O<sub>3</sub>) occurs via an Eley-Rideal style interaction where surface O<sub>2</sub> desorbs before attacking surface O to form O<sub>3</sub>. It is revealed that for Ni/Sb-SnO<sub>2</sub>, although the overall reaction is the same the surface mechanism is different. The formation of O<sub>3</sub> is found to occur through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism as opposed to the Eley-Rideal mechanism. In addition to this the relevant adsorption energies (E<sub>ads</sub>), Gibb's free energy (\u0394G<sub>rxn</sub>) and activation barriers (E<sub>act</sub>) for the final two steps modelled in the gas phase have been shown, providing the basis for a tool to develop new materials with higher current efficiencies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, LE11 3TU, UK. w.lin@lboro.ac.uk and School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, BT9 5AG, UK."}], "LastName": "Gibson", "ForeName": "Gregory", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2817-8367"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ziyun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7256-6765"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK."}], "LastName": "Hardacre", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4256-2058"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, LE11 3TU, UK. w.lin@lboro.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wen-Feng", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28102376", "10.1039/c6cp06906a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
