Pre-chlorination considerably decreased the autofluorescence of algae cells but barely influenced cell granularity. In comparison, after pre-ozonation more algae cells were associated with decreased cell size; yet less reduction in the autofluorescence was observed. In MA case, pre-chlorination increased the residual algae density after coagulation-filtration by 132%-146% while pre-ozonation enhanced the algae removal by 26%-28%. In CS case, algae removal was improved by pre-chlorination (32%-45%) and pre-ozonation (7%-45%). Pre-chlorination enhanced the removal of algogenic organic matters (AOM) by coagulation-filtration, especially for tryptophan-like and soluble microbial products. Effect of pre-ozonation on the fluorescence intensity of AOM after coauglation-filtration depended on AOM species and the ratio of [ozone dose]:[algae density]. In both MA and CS cases, chlorine increased the yields of trihalomethane (THM, 25%-78% and 51%-103%), haloacetic acid (HAA, 140%-360% and 167%-233%) and chloral (50%-161% and 68%-108%), respectively. Pre-ozonation decreased the total DBPs yields. For MA-added suspensions, ozone decreased the production of THM, HAA and chloral by 15%-37%, 28%-39% and 60%, respectively. In CS case, chloral yield was decreased by 12%-31% while THM formation was largely unchanged. HAA production varied by\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009\u03bcg/L."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
