The observed daily maximum hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroperoxy radical (HO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations were up to 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>7</sup>\u202fcm<sup>-3</sup> and 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>8</sup>\u202fcm<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, indicating the active photochemistry in autumn Beijing. Photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) and O<sub>3</sub> contributed 1-2 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup> to OH primary production during daytime. OH termination were dominated by the reaction with nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), which were in general larger than primary production rates, indicating other primary radical sources maybe important. The measurement of radicals facilitates the direct determination of local ozone production rate P (O<sub>x</sub>) (O<sub>x</sub>\u202f=\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fNO<sub>2</sub>). The integrated P(O<sub>x</sub>) reached 75 ppbv in afternoon (for 4\u202fh) when planetary boundary layer was well developed. At the same time period, the observed total oxidant concentrations O<sub>x</sub>, increased significantly by 70 ppbv. In addition, the O<sub>x</sub> measurement showed compact increase in 12 stations both temporally and spatially in Beijing, indicating that active photochemical production happened homogenously throughout the city. The back-trajectory analysis showed that Beijing was isolated from the other cities during the episode, which further proved that the fast ozone pollution was contributed by local photochemical production rather than regional advection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
