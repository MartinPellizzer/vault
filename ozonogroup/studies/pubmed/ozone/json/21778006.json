Correlation between ozone and PM(10) values was low, but statistically significant (P < 0.001). There were deaths from CHD (n = 267) and natural causes (n = 2,076) during the 7-year study period. For each 10-ppb increase in ozone, the risk of fatal CHD increased by 35% (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-1.77) in the single-pollutant model and 34% (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.76) in the 2-pollutant model.
