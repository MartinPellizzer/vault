Nanotechnology offers promising solutions to stem such yield losses against abiotic stresses. Silver nanoparticles are major nanomaterials used in consumer products however, their impact on crops under abiotic stress is limited. In this study, we evaluated the anti-ozonant efficacy of biogenic silver nanoparticles (B-AgNPs) and compared them with a model anti-ozonant ethylenediurea (EDU) against ozone phyto-toxicity. Growth, physiology, antioxidant defense, and yield parameters in two wheat cultivars (HD-2967 & DBW-17), treated with B-AgNPs (25\u00a0mg/L and 50\u00a0mg/L) and EDU (150\u00a0mg/L and 300\u00a0mg/L), were studied at both vegetative and reproductive stages. During the experimental period, the average ambient ozone concentration and accumulated dose of ozone over a threshold of 40\u00a0ppb (AOT40) (8\u00a0h day<sup>-1</sup>) were found to be 60\u00a0ppb and 6\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, respectively, which were sufficient to cause ozone-induced phyto-toxicity in wheat. Growth and yield for B-AgNPs as well as EDU-treated plants were significantly higher in both the tested cultivars over control ones. However, 25\u00a0mg/L B-AgNPs treatment showed a more pronounced effect in terms of yield attributes and its lower accumulation in grains for both cultivars. DBW-17 cultivar responded better with B-AgNPs and EDU treatments as compared to HD-2967. Meanwhile, foliar exposure of B-AgNPs (dose; 25\u00a0mg/L) significantly enhanced grain weight plant<sup>-1</sup>, thousand-grain weight, and harvest index by 54.22\u00a0%, 29.46\u00a0%, and 14.21\u00a0%, respectively in DBW-17, when compared to control. B-AgNPs could enhance ozone tolerance in wheat by increasing biochemical and physiological responses. It is concluded that B-AgNPs at optimum concentrations were as effective as EDU, hence could be a promising ozone protectant for wheat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
