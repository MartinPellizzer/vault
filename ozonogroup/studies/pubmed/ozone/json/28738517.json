Tree C sequestration was assessed by using empirical response functions, while soil C sequestration was simulated with the process-based model VSD, combined with the RothC model. We evaluated two empirical growth responses to N deposition (linear and non-linear) and two O<sub>3</sub> exposure relationships (linear function with total biomass or net annual increment). We further investigated an 'interactive model' with interactions between drivers and a 'multiplicative model', in which the combined effect is the product of individual drivers. A single deposition and climate scenario was used for the period 1900-2050. Contrary to expectations, growth observations at European level for the period 1950-2010 compared better with predictions by the multiplicative model than with the interactive model. This coincides with the fact that carbon responses in kgCha<sup>-1</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup> per unit change in drivers, i.e. per \u00b0C, ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, kgNha<sup>-1</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup> and mmolm<sup>-2</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup> POD, are more in line with literature data when using the multiplicative model. Compared to 1900, the estimated European average total C sequestration in both forests and forest soils between 1950 and 2000 increased by 21% in the interactive model and by 41% in the multiplicative model, but observed changes were even higher. This growth increase is expected to decline between 2000 and 2050. The simulated changes between 1950 and 2000 were mainly due to the increase in both N deposition and CO<sub>2</sub>, while the predicted increases between 2000 and 2050 were mainly caused by the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature, and to lesser extent a decrease in POD, counteracted by reduced N deposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
