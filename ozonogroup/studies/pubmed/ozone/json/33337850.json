Yet, quantification of FAP emissions from human beings remains limited, along with a poor understanding of the underlying emission mechanisms. To reduce the knowledge gap, we characterized human emissions of size-segregated FAPs (1-10 \u03bcm) and total particles in a climate chamber with low-background particle levels. We probed the influence of several personal factors (clothing coverage and age) and environmental parameters (level of ozone, air temperature, and relative humidity) on particle emissions from human volunteers. A material-balance model showed that the mean emission rate ranged 5.3-16 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> fluorescent particles per person-h (0.30-1.2 mg per person-h), with a dominant size mode within 3-5 \u03bcm. Volunteers wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants produced 40% more FAPs relative to those wearing t-shirts and shorts. Particle emissions varied across the age groups: seniors (average age 70.5 years) generated 50% fewer FAPs compared to young adults (25.0 years) and teenagers (13.8 years). While we did not observe a measurable influence of ozone (0 vs 40 ppb) on human FAP emissions, there was a strong influence of relative humidity (34 vs 62%), with FAP emissions decreasing by 30-60% at higher humidity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human-Oriented Built Environment Lab, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6107-8336"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Department of Civil Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Lyngby, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Bek\u00f6", "ForeName": "Gabriel", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Centre for Indoor Environment and Energy, Department of Civil Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Lyngby, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Wargocki", "ForeName": "Pawel", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9421-1703"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Hahn-Meitner Weg 1, 55128 Mainz, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy, Environment and Water Research Center, The Cyprus Institute, 2121 Nicosia, Cyprus."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5945-0872"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human-Oriented Built Environment Lab, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Licina", "ForeName": "Dusan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "9"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33337850", "10.1021/acs.est.0c06304"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
