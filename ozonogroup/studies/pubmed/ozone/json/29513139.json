Effluent dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is considered to be the precursor to nitrogen disinfection by-products (N-DBPs). Here, we investigated DON removal by pre-ozonation-enhanced coagulation and found that (1) pre-ozonation significantly enhanced the removal of DON, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and UV<sub>254</sub> by coagulation. (2) pH had an important impact on the pre-ozonation-enhanced coagulation. At lower pH, the removal of DON, DOC, and UV<sub>254</sub> is higher. (3) As ozone dosage increased, zeta potential gradually increased, while dissolved calcium concentrations declined and there was a strong correlation between zeta potential and dissolved calcium concentrations. (4) Small (<6\u2005kDa) molecular weight DON was dominant in the effluent. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic DON accounted for 58.5% and 30.8% of the total, respectively. (5) Coagulation reduced overall DBP formation potentials to less than 20%. In contrast, overall DBP formation potentials increased after ozonation. However, pre-ozonation-enhanced coagulation not only removed 71% DON, but also reduced overall DBP formation potentials by more than 40%. (6) 3-DEEM spectra indicated that DBP formation potentials and DON concentrations were related to three main peaks, which corresponded to tryptophan-based proteins, aromatic proteins, and fulvic acids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University , Xinyang , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution , Xinyang , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Key laboratory of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region's Eco-Environment, Ministry of Education, Chongqing University , Chongqing , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University , Xinyang , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qingfei", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University , Xinyang , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guozhong", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University , Xinyang , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chengmei", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University , Xinyang , People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Huimin", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29513139", "10.1080/09593330.2018.1449897"]}}]}
