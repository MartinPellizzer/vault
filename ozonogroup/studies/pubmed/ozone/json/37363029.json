However, the cleaning and maintenance of high-speed rail is a comprehensive task, which may easily cause environmental pollution. This study aims to analyze and improve the sustainability of the formulation and production process of a concentrated complex enzyme detergent used as the maintenance agent for high-speed trains via the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The eFootprint software system with built-in China, European and Swiss Ecoinvent databases was used to establish the LCA model with the system boundary being from cradle to gate. The LCA model showed that the production of 1\u00a0kg of concentrated detergent generates the global warming potential of 2.53\u00a0kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq, and other environmental emissions including acidification potential of 0.01\u00a0kg SO<sub>2</sub> eq, eutrophication potential of 3.76E-03\u00a0kg PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>eq, inhalable inorganic matter of 3.17E-03\u00a0kg PM2.5\u00a0eq, ozone depletion potential of 5.3E-06\u00a0kg CFC-11\u00a0eq, photochemical ozone formation potential of 3.44E-03\u00a0kg NMVOC eq, primary energy demand of 3.17\u00a0MJ, abiotic depletion potential of 4.97E-6\u00a0kg antimony eq, and water use of 0.84\u00a0kg. LCA results are not strongly dependent to the assumptions of the research, and the uncertainties of LCA results are between 8 and 16%, which is mainly due to the regional differences in technology sources, the year of technical data collection, and the representativeness of technology collection companies. Carbon footprint analysis showed that the production processes of enzyme stabilizer (glycerol) and surfactants contributed the most, while changes in power consumption during production and transportation distance of raw materials had limited effect on total carbon emissions. Therefore, the formulation of the concentrated complex enzymatic detergent was improved based on the LCA results. The new formulations with less enzyme stabilizer showed similar detergency to the original formulation. The new formulations could reduce carbon emissions by 5,500-9,200 tons per year and save between $4.4 and $7.4 million in annual production of 10,000 tons.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10668-023-03122-2."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s);
