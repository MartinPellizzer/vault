This study evaluated the effects of ozone on the detoxification of AFs in corn flour (CF) and the moisture content (MC) thereof.", "The detoxifying effects of ozone on CF became more obvious as the ozone concentration and exposure time increased. After CF was treated with 75 mg L(-1) ozone for 60 min, the contents of AFB1 , AFG1 and AFB2 decreased from 53.60, 12.08 and 2.42 \u00b5g kg(-1) to 11.38, 3.37 and 0.71 \u00b5g kg(-1) , respectively, which are lower than the maximum limits of AFB1 , AFG1 , AFB2 and total AFs (20 \u00b5g kg(-1) ) for CF regulated by the Chinese government. Ozonation significantly affected the MC of CF, and ozone at a higher concentration decreased the MC more drastically. After CF was exposed to 15, 30, 45 and 75 mg L(-1) ozone for 60 min, the MC of CF decreased from 17.4% to below 15%, fulfilling the long-period storage requirements for CF.", "Ozone is potentially applicable in effectively degrading the AFs in CF and in greatly decreasing the MC of CF."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, National Engineering Laboratory for Cereal Fermentation Technology, School of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, 214122, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xiaohu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ren", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongfu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhengxing", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24374809", "10.1002/jsfa.6550"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
