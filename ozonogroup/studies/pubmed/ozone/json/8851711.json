Estimated values were obtained for various regional points in Japan. There was a very high correlation (r = 0.98) between estimated and observed values at four weather stations during 1991-93. Ranks of the UV-B level for the 1990 year mean and decennial period means during 1961-1989 approximately equated ranks of latitude. However, > or = 10% variation in period means or > or = 10 difference in rank was observed at several regional points. Estimated UV-B level is affected by meteorological conditions including solar radiation and total ozone, and may serve as a refined and improved exposure index compared to conventional indices used in prior studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Epidemiology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawana", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okubo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utsunomiya", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J UOEH", "NlmUniqueID": "7909645", "ISSNLinking": "0387-821X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8851711", "10.7888/juoeh.18.51"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
