Among the innovative strategies proposed to contrast biofilms in food environments, ozone is recognised as an environmentally friendly technology but there are few studies about its effect against bacterial biofilms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of gaseous ozone (50 ppm for 6 h) in inhibition and eradication of biofilm formed by twenty-one dairyisolated <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. strains. Before ozone treatments, all isolates were screened for biofilm formation according to a previously described method. Strains were then divided in four groups: weak, weak/moderate, moderate/strong, and strong biofilm producers based on the biofilm biomass value of each isolate determined using the optical density (OD - 595 nm). Inhibition treatment was effective on the strain (C1) belonging to the weak producers' group, on all strains classified as weak/moderate producers, on two strains (C8 and C12) belonging to the group of moderate/strong producers and on one strain (C13) classified as strong producer. Conversely, eradication treatments were ineffective on all strains tested, except for the strain C4 which reduced its biofilm-forming abilities after exposure to ozone gas. In conclusion, gaseous ozone may be used to enhance existing sanitation protocols in food processing environments, but its application alone not seems sufficient to contrast <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. established biofilms."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9Copyright: the Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Turin, Italy."}], "LastName": "Panebianco", "ForeName": "Felice", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Turin, Italy."}], "LastName": "Rubiola", "ForeName": "Selene", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Turin, Italy."}], "LastName": "Chiesa", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Turin, Italy."}], "LastName": "Civera", "ForeName": "Tiziana", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Turin, Italy."}], "LastName": "Di Ciccio", "ForeName": "Pierluigi Aldo", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Ital J Food Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "101684120", "ISSNLinking": "2239-7132"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interest: The authors declare no potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aponte M, Anastasio A, Marrone R, Mercogliano R, Peruzy MF, Murru N, 2018.
