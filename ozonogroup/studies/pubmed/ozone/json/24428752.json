Though the onset of corona, as detected by the appearance of light, was always accompanied by a break in the current-voltage slope, such breaks also happened before the onset of corona, so they cannot be used as an adequate indicator of corona ignition. Of four ROS studied (hydrogen peroxide, ozone, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide anions), only H2O2 and ozone were found to be generated at a current of 150-200 nA in detectable quantities: with a yield of 0.5-1 H2O2 molecules per electron at positive potential and 1.5-3 at negative potential. Despite the low yield of the ROS, jack bean urease was shown to be inactivated when the enzyme solution with a concentration below 20 \u03bcg/mL was electrosprayed at a current of 200 nA. Addition of 0.1 mM EDTA totally protected the activity of the electrosprayed urease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Pushchino, Moscow region 142290, Russia."}], "LastName": "Kanev", "ForeName": "Igor L", "Initials": "IL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mikheev", "ForeName": "Andrei Y", "Initials": "AY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shlyapnikov", "ForeName": "Yuri M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shlyapnikova", "ForeName": "Elena A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morozova", "ForeName": "Tamara Y", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morozov", "ForeName": "Victor N", "Initials": "VN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24428752", "10.1021/ac403129f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
