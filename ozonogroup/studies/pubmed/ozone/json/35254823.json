The germination process involves multiple secondary metabolites, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are altered under ozone treatment. Here, an optimized solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was implemented to explore changes in VOCs from barley seeds under ozone treatment. The data demonstrated that barley released both a greater variety and quantity of VOCs under oxidative stress. The number of alcohols and hydrocarbons gradually decreased, whereas aldehydes and organic acids markedly increased with increasing ozone treatment time. Acetic acid was identified as a potential ozone stress-specific marker. Furthermore, the dosage-dependent function of acetic acid on the germination of barley was verified, namely, a low dosage of acetic acid increased the germination and vice versa. This study provided new insights into how barley responds to ozone treatment and highlighted the role of acetic acid in seed germination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 50 Zhongling Street, Nanjing 210014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical, Molecular and Forensic Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tea Research Institute, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical, Molecular and Forensic Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Litao", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical, Molecular and Forensic Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}], "LastName": "Maker", "ForeName": "Garth", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical, Molecular and Forensic Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Yonglin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2831-172X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 50 Zhongling Street, Nanjing 210014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical, Molecular and Forensic Sciences, Murdoch University, Perth 6150, Australia."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xiangyang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Microextraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35254823", "10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
