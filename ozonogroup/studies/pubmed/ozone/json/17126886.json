For comparative purposes, single ozonation and adsorption on activated carbon were carried out in the same experimental set-up. In order to evaluate the role of the activated carbon surface chemistry during ozonation, a commercial activated carbon, Norit GAC 1240 PLUS, was submitted to oxidation in the liquid phase with HNO(3). The texture and surface chemistry of the activated carbon samples were characterized. During ozonation, complete conversion of aniline was achieved after approximately 20 min, regardless of the presence of activated carbon. In all cases, several by-products were formed during ozonation. Nitrobenzene, o- and p-aminophenol were the primary aromatic oxidation by-products identified. In terms of TOC removal, best results were achieved by the simultaneous use of ozone and activated carbon. Though there is a strong contribution of adsorption, a considerable synergetic effect between ozone and activated carbon is observed. In general, activated carbon promotes the reaction of ozonation enhancing the efficiency of this treatment process. The basic activated carbon presented greater activity in this process leading to higher mineralization rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Cat\u00e1lise e Materiais, Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Faria", "ForeName": "P C C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orf\u00e3o", "ForeName": "J J M", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "M F R", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "23RH73DZ65", "NameOfSubstance": "2-aminophenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "411VRN1TV4", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R7P8FRP05V", "NameOfSubstance": "4-aminophenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SIR7XX2F1K", "NameOfSubstance": "aniline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aminophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17126886", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.10.020", "S0045-6535(06)01353-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
