The effects of O(3) on pulmonary immune cells have been studied in various in vivo and in vitro systems. We have shown previously that O(3) exposure of surfactant protein (SP)-A decreases its ability to modulate proinflammatory cytokine production by cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage (THP-1 cells). In this report, we exposed THP-1 cells and/or native SP-A obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with alveolar proteinosis to O(3) and studied cytokine production and NF-kappaB signaling. The results showed 1) exposure of THP-1 cells to O(3) significantly decreased their ability to express TNF-alpha in response to SP-A; TNF-alpha production, under these conditions, was still significantly higher than basal (unstimulated) levels in filtered air-exposed THP-1 cells; 2) exposure of both THP-1 cells and SP-A to O(3) did not result in any significant differences in TNF-alpha expression compared with basal levels; 3) O(3) exposure of SP-A resulted in a decreased ability of SP-A to activate the NF-kappaB pathway, as assessed by the lack of significant increase and decrease of the nuclear p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha, respectively; and 4) O(3) exposure of THP-1 cells resulted in a decrease in SP-A-mediated THP-1 cell responsiveness, which did not seem to be mediated via the classic NF-kappaB pathway. These findings indicate that O(3) exposure may mediate its effect on macrophage function both directly and indirectly (via SP-A oxidation) and by involving different mechanisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janic", "ForeName": "Branislava", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Umstead", "ForeName": "Todd M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phelps", "ForeName": "David S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Floros", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1R01 ES-09882-01", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100901229", "ISSNLinking": "1040-0605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15466251", "10.1152/ajplung.00125.2004", "00125.2004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
