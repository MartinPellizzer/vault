Within this framework, this paper aims to liberate CF and UPR from WTB using a pyrolysis process. The treatment was performed on commercial WTB (CF/UPR) up to 600\u00a0\u00b0C using a 250\u00a0g reactor. The UPR fraction was decomposed into liquid and gaseous phases, while CF remained as a residue. The composition of gaseous phase was monitored during the entire treatment using a digital gas analyser, while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to characterize the collected liquid phase. CF fraction was collected and exposed to additional oxidation process after treatment at 450\u00a0\u00b0C for purification propose, then it was analysed using FTIR and SEM-EDX. Finally, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the CF/UPR pyrolysis was studied using SimaPro software and the results were compared with landfill disposal practices. The pyrolysis results manifested that 500\u00a0\u00b0C was sufficient for UPR decomposition into styrene-rich oil and gaseous products with yields of 15.23\u00a0wt% and 6.83\u00a0wt%, respectively, accompanied by 77.93\u00a0wt% solid residue including CF. The LCA results showed that pyrolysis with oxidation process has high environmental potential in WTB recycling with significant reduction in several impact categories compared to landfill. However, the pyrolysis scenario revealed several additional environmental burdens related to ecosystems, acidification, Ozone formation, and fine particulate matter formation that must be overcome before upscaling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
