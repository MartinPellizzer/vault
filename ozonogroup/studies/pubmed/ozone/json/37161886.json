Here, we present an industrially practicable technology to significantly enhance the SCR activity at low temperatures (<250 \u00b0C). By introducing an appropriate amount of O<sub>3</sub> into the simulated stack gas, we find that O<sub>3</sub> can stoichiometrically oxidize NO to generate NO<sub>2</sub>, which enables NO reduction to follow the fast SCR mechanism so as to accelerate SCR at low temperatures, and, in particular, an increase in SCR rate by more than four times is observed over atom-pair V<sub>1</sub>-W<sub>1</sub> active sites supported on TiO<sub>2</sub>(001) at 200 \u00b0C. Using operando SCR tests and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra, we reveal that the introduction of O<sub>3</sub> allows SCR to proceed along a NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>-mediated Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, in which the adsorbed nitrate species speed up the re-oxidation of the catalytic sites that is the rate-limiting step of SCR, thus leading to the enhancement of activity at low temperatures. This technology could be applicable in the real stack gas conditions because O<sub>3</sub> exclusively oxidizes NO even in the co-presence of SO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, which provides a general strategy to improve low-temperature SCR efficacy from another perspective beyond designing catalysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Weiye", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, In-situ Center for Physical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Zhouhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Junxiao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8654-0774"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, In-situ Center for Physical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2391-4943"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0746-1294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment & Equipment Technology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xingfu", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalytic Domain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37161886", "10.1021/acs.est.3c00461"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
