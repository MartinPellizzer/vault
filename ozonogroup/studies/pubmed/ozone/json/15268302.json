In the CR-EOMCCSD(T) methods, which are based on the formalism of the method of moments of coupled-cluster equations, the suitably designed corrections due to triple excitations are added, in a state-selective manner, to the excited-state energies obtained in the standard equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations with singles and doubles (EOMCCSD). It is demonstrated that the CR-EOMCCSD(T) approaches, which can be regarded as the excited-state analogs of the ground-state CR-CCSD(T) theory, provide a highly accurate description of excited states dominated by double excitations, excited states displaying a manifestly multireference character, and PESs of excited states along bond breaking coordinates with the ease of the ground-state CCSD(T) or CR-CCSD(T) calculations. The performance of the CR-EOMCCSD(T) methods is illustrated by the results of calculations for the excited states of CH+, HF, N2, C2, and ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kowalski", "ForeName": "Karol", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Piecuch", "ForeName": "Piotr", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15268302", "10.1063/1.1632474"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
