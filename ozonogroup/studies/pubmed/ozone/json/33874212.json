(potato) was investigated. Ozone-tolerant cultivars 'Superior' (SP) and 'Norgold Russet' (NR), and O<sub>3</sub> -sensitive cultivars 'Cherokee' (CK) and 'Norland' (NL) were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> for five consecutive days in controlled-environment chambers. Leaf samples were obtained during the O<sub>3</sub> -exposure period and at 1, 5, and 10 d post-exposure. For both charcoal-filtered air (control) and O<sub>3</sub> -treated foliage, total activity of Rubisco declined with increasing leaf age. Ozone induced an accelerated decline in the carboxylation activity of Rubisco in leaves obtained from CK and NL by the third day of O<sub>3</sub> exposure. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> had no impact on the Rubisco activity from leaves of SP and NR as compared to non-treated foliage. Differential foliar conductance could not account for the response of the sensitive and tolerant cultivars. Rubisco was purified from cultivars SP and CK to determine whether protein sulphydryl content correlated with foliar O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity. The number of SH groups did not differ between the two cultivars, either in chemically denatured or non-denatured Rubisco. Consequently, neither number nor availability of SH groups appear to be factors controlling sensitivity of Rubisco to oxidative damage by O<sub>3</sub> ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Agricultural Molecular Biology, Cook College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903-0231."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enyedi", "ForeName": "Alexander J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, 211 Buckhout Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eckardt", "ForeName": "Nancy A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, 211 Buckhout Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "Eva J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Berhow M.
