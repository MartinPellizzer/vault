Lipidomics is the large-scale profiling and quantification of biogenic lipid molecules, the comprehensive study of their pathways and the interpretation of their physiological significance based on analytical chemistry and statistical analysis. Lipidomics will not only provide insight into the physiological functions of lipid molecules but will also provide an approach to discovering important biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment of human diseases. Mass-spectrometry-based analytical techniques are currently the most widely used and most effective tools for lipid profiling and quantification. In this review, the field of mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics was discussed. Recent progress in all essential steps in lipidomics was carefully discussed in this review, including lipid extraction strategies, separation techniques and mass-spectrometry-based analytical and quantitative methods in lipidomics. We also focused on novel resolution strategies for difficult problems in determining C=C bond positions in lipidomics. Finally, new technologies that were developed in recent years including single-cell lipidomics, flux-based lipidomics and multiomics technologies were also reviewed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
