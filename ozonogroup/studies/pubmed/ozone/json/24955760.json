The reaction rate constant exhibits a noticeable curvature of the temperature dependence in the Arrhenius plot, which can be represented by the following expression: kt-CFP (220-370 K) = 1.025 \u00d7 10(-13) \u00d7 (T/298)(2.29)\u2009exp(+384/T) cm(3\u00a0)molecule(-1)\u2009s(-1). The room-temperature rate constant was determined to be kt-CFP (298 K) = (3.29 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10(-13) cm(3)\u2009molecule(-1)\u2009s(-1), where the uncertainty includes both two standard errors (statistical) and the estimated systematic error. For atmospheric modeling purposes, the rate constant below room temperature can be represented by the following expression: kt-CFP (220-298 K) = (7.20 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7 10(-13)\u2009exp[-(237 \u00b1 16)/T]\u2009cm(3)\u2009molecule(-1)\u2009s(-1). There was no difference observed between the rate constants determined at 4 kPa (30 Torr) and 40 kPa (300 Torr) at both 298 and 370 K. The UV and IR absorption cross sections of this compound were measured at room temperature. The atmospheric lifetime, global warming potential, and ozone depletion potential of trans-CHCl\u2550CHCF3 were estimated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, United States."}], "LastName": "Orkin", "ForeName": "Vladimir L", "Initials": "VL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martynova", "ForeName": "Larissa E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kurylo", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24955760", "10.1021/jp5018949"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
