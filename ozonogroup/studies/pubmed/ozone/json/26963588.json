Here we report that atomically thin films of under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides (WOx with x < 3) grown on tungsten diselenide (WSe2) can be used as both controlled charge transfer dopants and low-barrier contacts for p-type WSe2 transistors. Exposure of atomically thin WSe2 transistors to ozone (O3) at 100 \u00b0C results in self-limiting oxidation of the WSe2 surfaces to conducting WOx films. WOx-covered WSe2 is highly hole-doped due to surface electron transfer from the underlying WSe2 to the high electron affinity WOx. The dopant concentration can be reduced by suppressing the electron affinity of WOx by air exposure, but exposure to O3 at room temperature leads to the recovery of the electron affinity. Hence, surface transfer doping with WOx is virtually controllable. Transistors based on WSe2 covered with WOx show only p-type conductions with orders of magnitude better on-current, on/off current ratio, and carrier mobility than without WOx, suggesting that the surface WOx serves as a p-type contact with a low hole Schottky barrier. Our findings point to a simple and effective strategy for creating p-type devices based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides with controlled dopant concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "WPI Center for Materials Nanoarchitechtonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science , Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "Mahito", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "WPI Center for Materials Nanoarchitechtonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science , Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakaharai", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University , Saitama 338-8570, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ueno", "ForeName": "Keiji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "WPI Center for Materials Nanoarchitechtonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science , Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tsukagoshi", "ForeName": "Kazuhito", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nano Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101088070", "ISSNLinking": "1530-6984"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26963588", "10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
