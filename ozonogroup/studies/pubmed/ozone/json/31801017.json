Facile preparation of 3D shape-changing structures with an extremely simple approach based on the elastomeric polymer still remains a challenging topic. Here, we report a fast digital patterning of surface topography of a single-layer elastomeric polymer toward 3D shape-changing structures. The surface topography features digitally engraved grooves by a laser engraver on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sheet, which is surface oxidized by the UV-ozone treatment. The resulting engraved PDMS sheets exhibit programmable shape-changing behaviors to form various 3D structures under the action of organic solvent. Experimental and numerical studies reveal the fundamental aspects of surface topography-guided 3D shape-changing structures. Demonstrations of this concept in developing various complex 3D shape-changing structures illustrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, thereby creating engineering opportunities in a wide range of applications such as actuators and soft robots."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0516-8817"], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1659-8073"], "LastName": "Linghu", "ForeName": "Changhong", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Kaixin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jinye", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Hongyu", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Chenghao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yipu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shun", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Soft Matter Research Center, and Key Laboratory of Soft Machines and Smart Devices of Zhejiang Province , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou 310027 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2821-9429"], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jizhou", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31801017", "10.1021/acsami.9b17343"]}}]}
