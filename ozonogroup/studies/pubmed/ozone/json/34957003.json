Unlike uncontrolled ionization and oxidation devices ACTIVE Particle Control\u2122 conditions particles in a highly controlled fashion which provides effective air purification without the generation of ozone or other toxic by-products. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ACTIVE Particle Control\u2122 on elevator cabin particle load compared to standard ventilation. The intervention trial utilized particle mass tools to determine the difference in particle clearance between standard elevator cabin ventilation and ACTIVE Particle Control\u2122 technology. Cabin particulate contaminants were significantly reduced using ACTIVE Particle Control\u2122 technology in an operating elevator."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Ereth, Wagoner, Blevins and Hess."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}], "LastName": "Ereth", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henderson Building Solutions, LLC, Lenexa, KS, United States."}], "LastName": "Wagoner", "ForeName": "Tracy", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henderson Building Solutions, LLC, Lenexa, KS, United States."}], "LastName": "Blevins", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SecureAire, Inc., Dunedin, FL, United States."}], "LastName": "Hess", "ForeName": "Donald", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101616579", "ISSNLinking": "2296-2565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decontamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Elevators and Escalators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}], "CoiStatement": "ME is the Chief Medical Officer and an investor in SecureAire, Inc., TW and MB are Mechanical Engineers at Henderson Building Solutions, LLC.
