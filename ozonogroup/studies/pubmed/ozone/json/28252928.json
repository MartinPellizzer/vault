Since it was first demonstrated [ Thomas et al. Anal. Chem. 2008 , 80 , 303 ], the method has been widely deployed for targeted lipid structure elucidation but its application to high throughput and liquid chromatography-based workflows has been limited due to the relatively slow nature of the requisite ion-molecule reactions that result in long ion-trapping times and consequently low instrument duty cycle. Here, the implementation of OzID in a high-pressure region, the ion-mobility spectrometry cell, of a contemporary quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer is described. In this configuration, a high number density of ozone was achieved and thus abundant and diagnostic OzID product ions could be observed even on the timescale of transmission through the reaction region (ca. 20-200 ms), representing a 50-1000-fold improvement in performance over prior OzID implementations. Collisional activation applied prereaction was found to yield complementary and structurally informative product ions arising from ozone- and collision-induced dissociation. Ultimately, the compatibility of this implementation with contemporary ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography is demonstrated with the resulting hyphenated approach showing the ability to separate and uniquely identify isomeric phosphatidylcholines that differ only in their position(s) of unsaturation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0420-6116"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology , Brisbane, Queensland 4001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Poad", "ForeName": "Berwyck L J", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waters Corporation , Altrincham Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 4AX, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Martin R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waters Corporation , Altrincham Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 4AX, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Kirk", "ForeName": "Jayne M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Waters Corporation , Altrincham Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 4AX, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Tomczyk", "ForeName": "Nick", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of Wollongong , Wollongong, New South Wales 2522, Australia."}], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "Todd W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Institute for Future Environments, Queensland University of Technology , Brisbane, Queensland 4001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Blanksby", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28252928", "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00268"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
