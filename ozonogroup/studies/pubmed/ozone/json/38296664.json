The chitosan/OKGM film was fortified with ZEO to assess the physical properties, structure, antioxidant and antibacterial abilities, and pork preservation systematically. Compared to the control group, the addition of 1\u00a0% ZEO increased tensile strength by 18.92\u00a0% and decreased water solubility, water vapor permeability, and moisture content by 10.05\u00a0%, 6.60\u00a0%, and 1.03\u00a0%, respectively. However, the treatment with ZEO (1.5\u00a0% and 2\u00a0%) decreased mechanical properties and increased the water vapor permeability. The ultraviolet barrier, antioxidant, and antibacterial abilities of composite films were enhanced by increasing the ZEO addition. Moreover, the COZ-1 film was used to protect the freshness of pork with slow-release behavior of ZEO. The results showed that addition of ZEO significantly decreased the pH value, total viable count, redness, total volatile basic nitrogen, and thiobarbituric acid and increased the hardness of pork after preservation for 10\u00a0days. Therefore, the chitosan/OKGM loaded with ZEO film can potentially be used as food packaging, providing new ideas for the research on active packaging materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
