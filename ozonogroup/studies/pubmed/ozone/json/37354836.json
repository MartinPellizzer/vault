The properties of EfOM have been considered a major concern in this process because EfOM fractions act differently as initiator, promoter or inhibitor of ozone decomposition and \u00b7OH scavenging, which further impacts the degradation effectiveness of TrOCs. This study isolated EfOM from three wastewater treatment plants into six fractions (HoA, HoB, HoN, HiA, HiB and HiN) to understand the reaction kinetics as a function of EfOM and its isolated fractions. Their reaction rate constants with \u00b7OH (k<sub>EfOM-\u00b7OH</sub>), and their roles as the initiator, promoter and inhibitor in the \u00b7OH chain reactions in ozone decomposition were further quantified. The results showed that k<sub>EfOM-\u00b7OH</sub> of hydrophilic fractions (HiF) (accounting for 17%) reached up to 10 times as high as that for hydrophobic fractions (HoF) (accounting for 83%) (7.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> versus 0.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting the dominating role of HiF in \u00b7OH scavenging. Hydrophilic base (HiB) was the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and reaction with \u00b7OH due to its highest rate constants of initiation and promotion. This study quantifies the kinetics and contribution of EfOM fractions in \u00b7OH scavenging, which will guide the optimization implementation of ozonation and other \u00b7OH-mediated AOPs toward wastewater effluents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
