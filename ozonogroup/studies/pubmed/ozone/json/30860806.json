Herein, we demonstrate rod-like nanosulfur (nS) deposited onto radially oriented open-porous microspherical reduced graphene oxide (rGO) architectures for improved rate and cyclic capabilities of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The combined chemistry of a spray-frozen assembly and ozonation drives the formation of a radially oriented open-porous structure and an overall microspherical morphology as well as uniform distribution and high loading of rod-like nS. Moreover, an optimum composition and strong bonding of the rGO/nS hybrid enables the optimization of redox kinetics for high sulfur utilization and high-rate capacities. The resulting rGO/nS hybrid provides a specific capacity and first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 1269.1 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and 98.5%, respectively, which are much greater than those of ice-templated and physically mixed rGO/nS hybrids and radially oriented open-porous rGO/bulk sulfur with the same hybrid composition. A 4C capacity of 510.3 mAhg<sup>-1</sup> and capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles (70.9% of the initial capacity over 300 cycles) also support the synergistic effect of the rod-like nS strongly interacting with the radially oriented open-porous rGO microspheres."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeon", "ForeName": "Jeong Seok", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Sol", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jae Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4424-4037"], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Ho Seok", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Nano", "NlmUniqueID": "101313589", "ISSNLinking": "1936-0851"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30860806", "10.1021/acsnano.8b08822"]}}]}
