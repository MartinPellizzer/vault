However, little is known about the effectiveness and accuracy of synergistic control region delineation. This study aimed to construct a network model and apply it to a case study of regional delineation in China at different scales to quantify the interactions between regions. Firstly, the Cumulative Risk Index (CRI) was proposed and quantified from a health risk perspective based on the daily mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> and daily maximum 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations from 2015 to 2020 in China. Then, the complex network topology parameters were introduced to determine the optimal threshold for different network constructions, and the Girvan-Newman (GN) algorithm was used to divide the network into independent regions. Results showed that the correlation between cities is more robust than that between provinces. There are four-seven major provincial-scale regions with strong synchronicity in CRI, suggesting that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> synergistic control policies shall be implemented jointly within these demarcated regions. Moreover, urban-scale CRI network analysis indicated that the existing key control areas (2 + 26 cities) need to be expanded to 40-50 cities and refined into seven independent urban regions. Meanwhile, the Fen-Wei Plain can be focused on six cities: Xi'an, Baoji, Xianyang, Weinan, Yuncheng, and Tongchuan. This study could improve our understanding of the synergistic control regions for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and the results could be used to develop joint control policies for both pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
