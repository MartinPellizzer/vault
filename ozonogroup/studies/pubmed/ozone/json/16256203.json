The wavelength dependency of such effects is of interest from mechanistic, physiological or economic points of view. Here, we describe an apparatus for determining the wavelength dependency of UV-B effects in biological and chemical systems. The apparatus consists of a high intensity UV radiation source and narrow bandpass filters to produce UV radiation in even intervals (between 280 and 360 nm). The usefulness of the equipment is demonstrated in two different systems: 1) Chalcone synthase (CHS) gene is up-regulated by UV-B radiation. Therefore quantitative analysis of the CHS gene expression was chosen in the present investigation for studies of the wavelength dependency of gene expression regulation in plants. Maximum induction of CHS expression was found at 300 nm with a 12-fold induction compared with the control; 2) The wavelength dependency of formation of dioxin-like photoproducts from the brominated flame retardant decabrominated diphenyl ether (DeBDE) is described. This is an example of UV-B-induced conversion of non-toxic species into a number of products of which some may be toxic in the environment. In the UV interval studied, the highest dioxin-like activity was found in the sample irradiated at 330 nm and therefore this wavelength is most important for the mechanism involved in photoconversion of DeBDE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Sciences and Orebro Life Science Center, Orebro University, S-701 82 Orebro, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalbin", "ForeName": "Georgi", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shaoshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olsman", "ForeName": "Helena", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pettersson", "ForeName": "Mikael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Engwall", "ForeName": "Magnus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strid", "ForeName": "Ake", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem Biophys Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "7907378", "ISSNLinking": "0165-022X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dioxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Failure Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Radiometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16256203", "10.1016/j.jbbm.2005.09.001", "S0165-022X(05)00142-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
