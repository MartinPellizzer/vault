Herein, a light-weight and high-porosity MnO<sub>2</sub>-based hybrid aerogel was synthesized with cellulose nanofibers using a facile ice-template approach, followed by freeze-drying. In the three-dimensional framework, the cellulose nanofibers serve as the skeletons to disperse MnO<sub>2</sub> particles, improving the exposure of active sites on MnO<sub>2</sub>. XPS, <sup>1</sup>H NMR and ATR-FTIR demonstrate that MnO<sub>2</sub> particles are effectively combined with cellulose nanofibers through hydrogen bonds, which originate from the abundant surface hydroxyl groups of both components. These consumed surface hydroxyl groups of MnO<sub>2</sub> not only reduce the water adsorption but also avoid the generation of surface-adsorbed H<sub>2</sub>O via the reaction with ozone, thus alleviating the catalyst deactivation. In addition, the interconnected macroporous structure enables the rapid diffusion of ozone molecules and facilitates the passage of water molecules, which is conducive to the adsorption and decomposition of ozone on the active sites, i.e. surface oxygen vacancies. Thus, the high and stable ozone conversion was achieved for 150\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub> under the relative humidity of 50% and the space velocity of 600\u00a0L\u00b7g<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup> within 10 days at room temperature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
