A heatable high-pressure flow reactor was employed. Hydroxyl radicals were prepared using reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms, O((1)D), produced in photolysis of N(2)O at 193 nm, with H(2)O. The temporal behavior of OH radicals was monitored via transient absorption of light from a dc discharge in H(2)O/Ar low-pressure resonance lamp at ca. 308 nm. The absolute intensity of the photolysis light was determined by accurate in situ actinometry based on the ozone formation in the presence of molecular oxygen. The results of this study combined with the literature data indicate that the rate constant of reaction 1a, associated with the pressure independent component, decreases with temperature within the temperature range 298-414 K and increases above 555 K. The pressure dependent rate constant for (1b) was parametrized using the Troe expression as k(1b,inf) = (2.4 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10(-11)(T/300)(-0.5) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), k(1b,0) = [He] (9.0 \u00b1 2.2) \u00d7 10(-31)(T/300)(-3.5\u00b10.5) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), F(c) = 0.37."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Environmental Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, New Jersey 07102, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Manuvesh", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chesnokov", "ForeName": "Evgeni N", "Initials": "EN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krasnoperov", "ForeName": "Lev N", "Initials": "LN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22397582", "10.1021/jp211805v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
