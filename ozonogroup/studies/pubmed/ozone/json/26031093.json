N2O emission fluxes were measured by static dark chamber-gas chromatograph method. The results showed that the accumulative amount of N2O (AAN) were decreased by 37.8% (P = 0.000 ) and 8.8% (P = 0.903 ) under T1 and T2 treatments, respectively, in the turning-green stage of winter wheat. In the elongation-booting stage, ANN were decreased by 15.0% (P = 0.217) and 39.1% (P = 0.000) under T1 and T2 treatments, respectively. ANN were decreased by 18.9% (P = 0.138) and 25.6% (P = 0.000) under T1 and T2 treatments, respectively, during the whole winter-wheat growing season. No significant impact of elevated O3 concentration on N2O emission from soil-soybean system was found due to the less rainfall during the soybean growing season, drought had a stronger stress on soybean than O3 concentration. The results of this study suggested that elevated O3 concentration could reduce N2O emission from arid farmland."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yang-Zhou", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zheng-Hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cen-Zi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shu-Tao", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Qi-Tao", "Initials": "QT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26031093"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
