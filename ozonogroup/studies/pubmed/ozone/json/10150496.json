The survey was conducted in Spain, Germany and the UK. There were high levels of awareness of environmental issues, with ozone layer damage and global warming being of particular concern. Most respondents were aware of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) use in aerosols and in refrigerators. However, their presence in asthma metered dose inhalers (MDIs) was much less widely known. German physicians had the highest awareness (78%) while only 1 in 10 of UK patients was aware. Patients expressed concern on learning that they inhale CFCs. Reaction to the concept of a non-CFC propellant was universally favourable, though sometimes qualified with the need for adequate safety and efficacy data. Patients expected to be informed of the change by doctors, pharmacists or patient information leaflets. Physicians expected to receive information as soon as possible but did not want patients informed until launch. Manufacturers and representatives would be the primary information sources for physicians. Pack changes should be minimised. Communicating the change to non-CFC propellants to physicians, pharmacists and patients is all important."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Glaxo Research and Development Ltd, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlaeppi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Aerosol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8809251", "ISSNLinking": "0894-2684"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Product Surveillance, Postmarketing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10150496", "10.1089/jam.1995.8.suppl_1.s-49"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
