In a new variation of the FIDI method, 1-2-mm-diameter droplets hang from a capillary and undergo heterogeneous reactions between solution-phase analytes and gas-phase species. Following a specified reaction time, the application of a high electric field induces FIDI in the droplet, generating fine jets of highly charged progeny droplets that are characterized by mass spectrometry. Sampling over a range of delay times following exposure of the droplet to gas-phase reactants, the spectra yield the temporal variation of reactant and product concentrations. We illustrate the technique with three examples: the adsorption of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon naphthalene into a water-methanol droplet, the ozonolysis of oleic acid, and localization of the carbon-carbon double bond within a lysophosphatidic acid. Gas-phase naphthalene reacts with 80% methanol-20% water droplets containing 100 microM silver nitrate. Positive ion mass spectra show increasing concentrations of silver ion-naphthalene adducts as exposure times increase. To examine the ozonolysis of organic molecules, gas-phase ozone generated by a mercury pencil-style lamp reacts with either 10 microM oleic acid or 100 microM oleoyl-L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; 18:1). Negative ion spectra from the ozonolysis of oleic acid show azelaic acid and 9-oxononanoic acid as the principle reaction products. Ozonolysis products from LPA (18:1) unambiguously demonstrate the double bond position in the original phospholipid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and the Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grimm", "ForeName": "Ronald L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hodyss", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beauchamp", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16737240", "10.1021/ac0601922"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
