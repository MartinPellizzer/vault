Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.", "Experimental study.", "Study IOLs were implanted in the right eyes and control IOLs in the left eyes of 10 New Zealand rabbits. Slitlamp examinations were performed 1 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) posterior capsulotomy was performed in both eyes of 5 rabbits after the 4-week slitlamp examination. At 6 weeks, the rabbits were killed humanely and their globes were enucleated. Capsular bag opacification was scored from the posterior aspect (Miyake-Apple view), and the eyes were processed for histopathology.", "At 4 weeks, the mean posterior capsule opacification (PCO) scores were 0.88 \u00b1 0.33 (SD) in the study eyes and 2.55 \u00b1 1.13 in the control eyes (P=.003, 2-tailed paired t test). Performance of Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy was similar in both groups. Gross postmortem examination also showed statistically less peripheral PCO in eyes with the study IOLs than in control eyes. There was no difference in histopathologic findings between study eyes and control eyes and no signs of untoward inflammation or toxicity in any eye evaluated.", "Treatment of the posterior surface of a single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL with UV-O3 appears to prevent PCO, likely by increasing adhesion between the posterior capsule and the IOL while retaining uveal biocompatibility. Performance of Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy was similar between treated IOLs and untreated IOLs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 ASCRS and ESCRS. Published by Elsevier Inc.
