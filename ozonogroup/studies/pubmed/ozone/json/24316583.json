These hydroperoxide-conjugated groups were then used as initiators at room temperature for redox graft polymerization of the fluoro vinylic monomer 1H,1H-heptaflourobutyl methacrylate (HFBM). The ozonolysis process allows, on one hand, for the formation of the desired hydroperoxide-conjugated groups while, on the other hand, leads to an undesired degradation of the PP. The ozone treatment time was therefore optimized to obtain sufficient hydroperoxide groups for graft polymerization, while maintaining the mechanical strength of the films, which was barely affected. The resulting PP-PolyHFBM (PP-PHFBM) films were characterized by methods such as AFM, ATR, TGA, contact angle goniometry and XPS. The antibiofilm properties of the PP-PHFBM films were evaluated, using two bacterial strains. An 86% inhibition was observed for the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and a 37% inhibition was observed for the Gram-positive Listeria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.
