Simultaneous field measurements of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, including NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, HONO, and 106 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were conducted at an urban site (the municipal environmental monitoring station, MEM) in Zhengzhou in July 2019. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which incorporates the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCMv3.3.1), was modified to work as a 0-D observation-based photochemical box model to assess the sources and sinks of HO<sub>x</sub> radicals and O<sub>3</sub>, and the OH reactivity (K<sub>OH</sub>) and ozone formation potential (OFP) of major VOC groups. In addition, the O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub>x</sub>-VOC sensitivity was evaluated using the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) and O<sub>3</sub> formation isopleth techniques. The OH radicals were mainly generated from the propagation reaction of HO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO (91-95%). The daily average mixing ratios of OH and HO<sub>2</sub> radicals were significantly higher during high O<sub>3</sub> days, reaching as high as 4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> and 7.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Photochemical O<sub>3</sub> formation was mostly due to the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> by HO<sub>2</sub> radicals (52-54%), while the NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0OH reaction was the main contributor to O<sub>3</sub> destruction (70-\u00a076%). Alkenes and aromatics were the main anthropogenic VOC contributors to K<sub>OH</sub> and OFP. Contributions of biogenic VOCs became much more important on high O<sub>3</sub> days, correlating with the increase in temperature and solar radiation. RIR analysis showed that the O<sub>3</sub> formation was under the VOC-limited on low O<sub>3</sub> days but was in the transition regime during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution buildup and persisting days. These results are generally consistent with those based on the O<sub>3</sub> formation isopleth. This paper provides important corroborative scientific evidence urgently needed by local governments to formulate O<sub>3</sub> pollution control strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
