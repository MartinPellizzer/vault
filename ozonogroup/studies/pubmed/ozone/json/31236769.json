In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanism of bromate formation, microbial communities and bioreactors that are responsible for bromate reduction. Bromate can be formed through two pathways of bromide oxidation by ozone or by <sup>\u00b7</sup>OH, and it can be removed by biological approaches. Members belonging to phyla of Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Clostridium, Deinococcus-Thermus and Bacteroidetes have been identified as capable of reducing bromate to bromide. Multiple configurations of biofilm bioreactors have been employed to cultivate microbial communities to perform bromate removal. The rapid development of multiomics has and will continue to accelerate the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in bromate and other DBP conversions, as well as the interaction patterns among different bacterial subdivisions in the bioremoval of DBPs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Xinyue", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Waheed", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China. maoy@szu.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7466-629X"], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Yanping", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biodegradation", "NlmUniqueID": "9100834", "ISSNLinking": "0923-9820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31236769", "10.1007/s10532-019-09882-x", "10.1007/s10532-019-09882-x"]}}]}
