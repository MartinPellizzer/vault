In this work, a combination method of steam and nitric acid was used to control the dealuminization of Y zeolite, and then manganese oxide was loaded on the Y zeolite by impregnation method. It was found that MnO<sub>x</sub> was highly dispersed in the dealumination zeolite, and the adsorbed oxygens were more easily activated in the active oxygen vacancies. The MnO<sub>x</sub> supported on dealumination Y zeolite showed better catalytic effect than that supported on the parent Y. At low humidity (0.8%) in 30\u00a0\u00b0C, the degradation efficiency of toluene reached above 94% by using the catalyst with mild dealumination. When more water vapor was introduced, the degradation of toluene was inhibited. However, the catalytic performance of the catalyst with deep dealumination was not affected. With the help of in-situ DRIFTS, it was observed that the intermediates and reaction by-products had changed under different humidity conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
