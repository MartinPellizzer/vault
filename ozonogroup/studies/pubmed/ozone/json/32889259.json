This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap based on a routine health examination cohort in Shijiazhuang, China.", "We included 7063 participants who took the routine health examination for 2-3 times at Hebei General Hospital from January 2016 to December 2018. Individual serum levels of cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured. Their three-month average exposure to air pollution prior to the routine health examinations was estimated using inverse distance weighted method. We used linear mixed-effects regression models to examine the associations between air pollution and levels of blood lipids while controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol drinking, temperature, humidity, with a random effect for each individual.", "Particles with diameters \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm and \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were all positively associated with TC, TG, and LDL-C and negatively associated with HDL-C, in single pollutant models. Each 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment of 3-month average PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with 0.65% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03%-1.28%], 0.56% (95%CI: 0.33%-0.79%) and 0.63% (95%CI: 0.35%-0.91%) increment in TG, TC, and LDL-C, and 0.91% (95%CI: 0.68%-1.13%) decrease in HDL-C. In two-pollutant models, the effects of gaseous pollutants on blood lipids were weakened, while those of PMs were strengthened. Stronger associations were presented in the elderly (\u226560\u00a0years) and overweight/obese (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a024) participants.", "Ambient air pollution had significantly adverse effects on blood lipid levels, especially in overweight/obese and elderly individuals.", "Significant associations between increased air pollution and worse blood lipid levels were found, especially in overweight/obese and elderly individuals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
