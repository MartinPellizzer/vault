Therefore, in the present study, the characteristics of tree-ring width formation of the prevailing Lithuanian tree species, Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver and downy birch, and key factors resulting in their differences during the last 36-year period were investigated at forest sites located on poor mineral oligotrophic and on nutrient-rich organic mesoeutrophic soils. The aim of the study was as follows: first, to separately detect the maximum possible seasonal effect of three groups of variables - meteorology, acidifying pollutants and surface ozone on the stem basal area increment (BAI) of the evaluated tree species; second, to assess the significance of each group of variables affecting the BAI of these tree species integrally with the remaining groups of variables. Norway spruce was found to be well adapted to recent environmental changes, which makes it one of the most favourable tree species for silviculture in the northeastern part of Europe. The rapid increases recorded in growth intensity since 1980 were attributed to the increase in air temperature, precipitation amount, nitrogen deposition during the vegetative stage and reductions in SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and S deposition. Scots pine demonstrated the highest level of resilience and capacity to adapt to recent global changes because its reaction to both negative and favourable environmental factors was best expressed. Silver and downy birch tree reactions to the effects of air concentrations of acidifying compounds, their deposition and surface ozone concentrations were the least expressed; however, a significant decline in growth intensity indicated that these tree species experienced a reduced resistance to recent changes in environmental conditions in the mature and over-mature age groups."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
