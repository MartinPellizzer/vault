Eight welding companies participated in this study. Health concerns raised by welders were welders' flash, sore/red/teary eyes, headaches, nosebleeds, and a black mucous discharge from their nasal membrane. Most welders expressed concern regarding excessive smoke levels in the workplace and inadequate ventilation. Types of welding identified were MIG mild steel, MIG stainless steel, and TIG aluminum. Monitoring involved an assessment of noise levels, fume composition, and carbon monoxide and ozone concentrations. Metal analyses were according to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7300. Noise dosimeters used were the Quest model 100 and Micro 14 & 15. Carbon monoxide was monitored using the Gastech Model 4700 and ozone using the AID Portable Ozone Meter Model 560. In Manitoba, a hearing conservation program is required when the equivalent sound exposure level (normalized Lex 8-hr) exceeds 80 dBA-weighted. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' threshold limit value-time weighted average (ACGIH TLV-TWA) for iron is 5.0 mg/m3, manganese is 0.2 mg/m3, carbon monoxide is 25 ppm, and ozone is 0.05 ppm (heavy work), 0.08 ppm (moderate work), and 0.1 ppm (light work). Welders' personal exposures to manganese ranged from 0.01-4.93 mg/m3 (N = 42; AM = 0.5; GM = 0.2; SD +/- 0.9; GSD +/- 3.2) and to iron ranged from 0.04-16.29 mg/m3 (N = 42; AM = 3.0; GM = 1.4; SD +/- 3.5; GSD +/- 2.5). Noise exposures ranged from 79-98 dBA (N = 44; AM = 88.9; GM = 88.8; SD +/- 4.2; GSD +/- 1.0). Carbon monoxide levels were less than 5.0 ppm (at source) and ozone levels varied from 0.4-0.6 ppm (at source). Ventilation upgrades in the workplace were required in most welding shops. Only 7 percent of the welders wore respiratory protection. A hearing conservation program and hearing protection were required at all monitored workplaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Workplace Safety & Health Branch, Manitoba Labour, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korczynski", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Appl Occup Environ Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "9103256", "ISSNLinking": "1047-322X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Noise, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protective Clothing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workplace"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11141606", "10.1080/104732200750051175"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
