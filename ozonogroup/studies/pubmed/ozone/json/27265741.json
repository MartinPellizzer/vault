Rice production in the domain accounted for 13% of the national total with three crop cycles per year. We assessed ozone (O3) induced rice production loss in the domain for 2010 using simulated hourly surface O3 concentrations (WRF/CAMx; 4km resolution). Simulated O3 was higher in January-February (largely overlaps the first crop) and September-December (third crop), and lower in March-June (second crop). Spatially, O3 was higher in downwind locations of HCMC and were comparable with observed data. Relative yield loss (RYL) was assessed for each crop over the respective growing period (105days) using three metrics: AOT40, M7 and flux-based O3 dose of POD10. Higher RYL was estimated for the downwind of HCMC. Overall, the rice production loss due to O3 exposure in the study domain in 2010 was the highest for the first crop (up to 25,800metrictons), the second highest for the third crop (up to 21,500tons) and the least for the second crop (up to 6800tons). The low RYL obtained for the second crop by POD10 may be due to the use of a high threshold value (Y=10nmolm(-2)s(-1)). Linear regression between non-null radiation POD0 and POD10 had similar slopes for the first and third crop when POD0 was higher and very low slope for the second crop when POD0 was low. The results of this study can be used for the rice crop planning to avoid the period of potential high RYL due to O3 exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
