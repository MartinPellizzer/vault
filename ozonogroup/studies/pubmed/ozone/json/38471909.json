Combined with meteorological conditions\uff0c the pollution characteristics\uff0c source contributions\uff0c and reactivity of VOCs in winter and summer were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the volume fraction of atmospheric VOCs in two episodes were \uff0827.92\u00b112.68\uff09\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and \uff0824.30\u00b15.93\uff09\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\uff0c respectively. The volume fraction of atmospheric VOCs in the haze pollution process in winter was larger than that in the ozone pollution process in summer. The analysis results of winter sources were as follows\uff1a industrial source \uff0827.0%\uff09\uff0c motor vehicle source \uff0822.5%\uff09\uff0c combustion source \uff0820.1%\uff09\uff0c solvent use source \uff0816.3%\uff09\uff0c and oil and gas volatilization source \uff0814.1%\uff09. The analysis results of summer sources were as follows\uff1a motor vehicle source \uff0824.8%\uff09\uff0c industrial source \uff0824.1%\uff09\uff0c solvent source \uff0817.4%\uff09\uff0c oil and gas volatilization source \uff0814.2%\uff09\uff0c combustion source \uff0811.2%\uff09\uff0c and plant source \uff088.4%\uff09. The results of the smog production model showed that the proportion of days in the synergistic control zone of VOCs during the two pollution processes in summer \uff0866.7%\uff09 was smaller than that in winter \uff08100.0%\uff09. The secondary reaction activity results showed that the average \u00b7OH loss rate \uff08<i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>\uff09 values in winter and summer were 4.12 s<sup>-1</sup> and 4.75 s<sup>-1</sup>\uff0c respectively. The average ozone formation potential \uff08OFP\uff09 values in summer were 108.36 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The olefins were dominant in the top ten species due to <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> and OFP contributions in summer. The total SOAFP values in winter in Zhengzhou were 54.38 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Among the top ten species contributing to SOAFP in winter\uff0c nine were aromatic hydrocarbons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Meng-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Xin-Shuai", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471909", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202301125"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
