Recent studies have linked long- and short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure to several public health risks. In this study, we (1) characterize the long-term and short-term O<sub>3</sub>-attributed health metric in China from 2015 to 2019; (2) estimate the surface O<sub>3</sub> trends; and (3) quantify the long-term and short-term health impacts (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality) in 350 urban Chinese cities. In these 5-years, the national annual average of daily maximum 8\u00a0h average (AVGDMA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and warm-season (April-September) 4th highest daily maximum 8\u00a0h average (4DMA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased from 74.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) to 82.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 167\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> to 174\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> respectively. During this period, the DMA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased by 1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>/yr across China, with over 70% of the monitoring sites showing a positive upward trend and 19.4% with trends >5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>/yr. The estimated long-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities attributable to AVGDMA8 O<sub>3</sub> exposure in 350 Chinese cities were 181,000 (95% CI: 91,500-352,000), 112,000 (95% CI: 38,100-214,000) and 33,800 (95% CI: 0-71,400) in 2019, showing increases of 52.5%, 52.9% and 54.6% respectively compared to 2015 levels. Similarly, short-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities attributed to ambient 4DMA8 O<sub>3</sub> exposure were 156,000 (95% CI: 85,300-227,000), 73,500 (95% CI: 27,500-119,000) and 28,600 (95% CI: 14,500-42,800) in 2019, increases of 19.6%, 19.8% and 21.2% respectively compared to 2015. The results of this study are important in ascertaining the e\ufb00ectiveness of recent emission control measures and to identify the areas that require urgent attention."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
