In this study, we evaluated the associations between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in large cohort of adults aged 18-90 years. The study cohort included 29,091 Lumosity users in the contiguous US who completed 20 repetitions of the Lost in Migration game between 2017 and 2018. Game scores reflect the ability to filter information and avoid distracting information. Long-term air pollution data included ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> averaged for the 365-day period before each gameplay date. Generalized linear models were used to examine the associations between long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and game score percentile. Co-pollutant models were adjusted for meteorology, time trend, age, gender, device, education, local socioeconomic factors, and urbanicity. Results represent the change in attention game score percentile per 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> or 0.01\u00a0ppm increase in O<sub>3</sub>. In the entire cohort, a -0.10 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.04) change in score percentile was associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while no significant association was observed with O<sub>3</sub>. Modification of these associations by age was observed for both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, with stronger associations observed in younger users. In users aged 18-29, a -0.25 (-0.45, -0.05) change in score percentile was associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while no associations were observed in other age groups. With O<sub>3</sub>, there was a -2.92 (-4.63, -1.19) and -2.81 (-4.29, -1.25) change in score percentile for users aged 18-29 and 30-39, respectively. We observed that elevated long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were associated with decreased focus scores in young adults, but follow-up research is necessary to further illuminate these associations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Wyatt", "ForeName": "Lauren H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education at the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA; Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Cleland", "ForeName": "Stephanie E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Naman", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Amrita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Ward-Caviness", "ForeName": "Cavin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Henderson", "ForeName": "Sarah B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.
