To optimize a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method, the recoveries at each step were evaluated. The steps improved the recoveries of chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxon, diazinon, diazoxon, and 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol up to 80% or more by removing interferents, but diethyl phosphate was almost lost during the partition procedure, and the 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol recovery was below 65%. Therefore, the compounds were evaluated using different solvent compositions based on a quick polar pesticides method; note that 100% methanol showed acceptable extraction results. The optimized method provided method detection limits ranging from 0.03 to 1.22\u00a0ng/g and good linearities (R<sup>2\u00a0</sup> >\u00a00.996). The recovery values were between 82.1 and 113.3%. The intra- and interday reproducibility was evaluated to be within 8.6 and 9.9%, respectively. The method was applied to determine the degradation efficiency of chlorpyrifos and diazinon and their by-products formed during plasma treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Western Seoul Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Juri", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Consumer Safety Research Division, Korea Food Research Institute, Jeollabuk-Do, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yun-Ji", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8045-3784"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Western Seoul Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Na", "ForeName": "Yun-Cheol", "Initials": "YC"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "C140370", "Agency": "Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI)", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "E0192103-01", "Agency": "Korea Food Research Institute (KFRI)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JCS58I644W", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorpyrifos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YUS1M1Q929", "NameOfSubstance": "Diazinon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorpyrifos"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diazinon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perilla"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kim K-H, Kabir E, Jahan SA.
