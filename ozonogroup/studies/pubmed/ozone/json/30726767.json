The impacts of elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen (N) deposition are raising concerns. However, knowledge of the combined effects of elevated O<sub>3</sub> and N loading are still limited. We investigated whether nitrogen loading mitigates the negative impacts of ozone on two larch species: the Japanese larch (L. kaempferi) and its hybrid larch F<sub>1</sub> (L. gmelinii var. japonica\u202f\u00d7\u202fL. kaempferi) or not. We used open-top cambers and compared responses of the larch seedlings. Results showed the N loading mitigated the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on Japanese larch. However, in hybrid larch F<sub>1</sub>, N loading did not mitigate O<sub>3</sub>-induced inhibition of growth and photosynthetic capacity. Mitigation effect of N loading on negative O<sub>3</sub> impacts may vary between the two Larix spp., Hybrid larch F<sub>1</sub> could be more affected by the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub> and N loading due to its higher growth response to N loading. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> also reduced leaf nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratio by elevated O<sub>3</sub>, with significant effects in hybrid larch F<sub>1</sub>, particularly under N loading. In the present study, leaf N/P ratio was utilized to validate the hypothesis that a positive effect of N loading may be observed if O<sub>3</sub> does not induce P limitation in Larix spp. We demonstrated a potential leaf N/P ratio function, which could reflect responses to O<sub>3</sub> and N loading in hybrid larch F<sub>1</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
