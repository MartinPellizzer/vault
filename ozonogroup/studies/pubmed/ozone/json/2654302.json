Chronic exposure to UV irradiation and a high total cumulative dose may be less deleterious than are periodic bursts of large amounts of sun exposure leading to severe sunburn. Such an exposure pattern is characteristic of individuals such as office workers whose outdoor activities are irregular rather than daily, as with farmers or fisherman. Although UV irradiation is injurious to many cellular elements, the mechanisms underlying UV-mediated skin cancer are thought to be most likely related to DNA damage to cutaneous cells. Various types of UV-induced DNA damage have been identified, and they differ in biologic significance. Damage which is apt to be most cytotoxic is probably less effective as an inducer of skin cancer than is more subtle damage, which is tolerated but can initiate malignant transformation. Repair of DNA damage involves specific cellular activities which vary in their effectiveness in restoring cutaneous cell function to normal. Other biologic effects of UV irradiation may contribute to the development of skin cancer through effects on such defenses as pigmentation and the immune response. Sun-induced damage to DNA, however, is apparently necessary. Biologic consequences of dangerous environmental exposure to UV irradiation can be modulated by changes in life-style, the depth of the ozone layer, use of sunscreens, and possibly by hormones or their synthetic analogs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University, New York, New York."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ross", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carter", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0426720", "ISSNLinking": "0022-202X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Invest Dermatol 1989 Dec;93(6):718"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "58"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2654302", "10.1111/1523-1747.ep13076718", "0022-202X(89)90850-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
