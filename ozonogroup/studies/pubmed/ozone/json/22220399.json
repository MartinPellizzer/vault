Study of pollutant variation and its relationship with both dynamic and thermodynamic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) structures is of importance not only for environmental protection but also for the public at large. The aim of this study was to analyze seasonal, daily and intradiurnal variation of PM10, NO2, NO and O3 in a residential part of an urban area, and the effect of some meteorological parameters. The study was conducted from January 1 till December 31, 2004 in the City of Zagreb using following methods: beta radiation absorption, chemiluminescence and UV photometry. The results presented in this article, show the dependence of air pollution levels upon traffic density, seasons and meteorological conditions. Considering the level of air pollution relative to the regulated limit and tolerated values, the measured 24-hour concentrations of all study pollutants exceeded the borderline values and/or tolerated values, however, the number of days with such pollutant concentrations did not exceed the allowed frequency. This is a preliminary study with the main objectives to point to the possible identification of the source of pollution and to assess the level of air contamination according to the new national legislation coordinated with European regulations. Future measurements and studies should evaluate in detail the causes of the concentration levels detected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Applied Sciences Velika Gorica, Velika Gorica, Croatia. ivan.toth@vvg.hr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toth", "ForeName": "Ivan", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hercog", "ForeName": "Predrag", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peternel", "ForeName": "Renata", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vojnikovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Bozo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Coll Antropol", "NlmUniqueID": "8003354", "ISSNLinking": "0350-6134"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Croatia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22220399"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
