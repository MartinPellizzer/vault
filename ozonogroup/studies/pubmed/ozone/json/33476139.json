We present here an energy-efficient clathrate-based greenhouse gas-separation (CBGS) technology that can operate at room temperature for selectively recovering N<sub>2</sub>O from gas mixtures. Clathrate formation between \u03b1-form/\u03b2-form hydroquinone (\u03b1-HQ/\u03b2-HQ) and gas mixtures reveals guest-specific and structure-driven selectivity, revealing the preferential capture of N<sub>2</sub>O in \u03b2-HQ and the molecular sieving characteristics of \u03b1-HQ. With a maximum gas storage capacity and cage occupancy of 54.1 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.86, respectively, HQ clathrate compounds including N<sub>2</sub>O are stable at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and thus can be easily synthesized, treated, and recycled via commercial CBGS processes. High selectivity for N<sub>2</sub>O recovery was observed during \u03b2-HQ clathrate formation from N<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> gas mixtures with N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations exceeding 20%, whereas \u03b1-HQ traps only N<sub>2</sub> molecules from gas mixtures. Full characterization using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and compositional analysis and the formation kinetics of HQ clathrates was conducted to verify the peculiar selectivity behavior and to design the conceptual CBGS process. These results provide a new playground on which to tailor host-guest materials and develop commercial processes for the recovery and/or sequestration of greenhouse gases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Convergence Study on Ocean Science and Technology, Ocean Science and Technology (OST) School, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, Busan 49112, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Jiyeong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Convergence Study on Ocean Science and Technology, Ocean Science and Technology (OST) School, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, Busan 49112, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Sol Geo", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy and Resources Engineering, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, Busan 49112, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Jae Hak", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy and Resources Engineering, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, Busan 49112, Korea."}], "LastName": "Raghu", "ForeName": "Appu Vengattoor", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6771-672X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Kongju National University, Gongju-si, Chungnam 31080, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jong-Won", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3259-2624"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy and Resources Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, Kangwon 24341, Korea."}], "LastName": "Cha", "ForeName": "Minjun", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6121-4780"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy Process Research Institute (EPRI), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8569, Japan."}], "LastName": "Muromachi", "ForeName": "Sanehiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy Process Research Institute (EPRI), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8569, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "Yoshitaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0234-9367"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Convergence Study on Ocean Science and Technology, Ocean Science and Technology (OST) School, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, Busan 49112, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy and Resources Engineering, Korea Maritime and Ocean University, Busan 49112, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy Process Research Institute (EPRI), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8569, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Ji-Ho", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Greenhouse Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33476139", "10.1021/acs.est.0c06233"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
