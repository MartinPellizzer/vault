Group 1(control group-irrigation with saline) and Group 2(study group-irrigation with ozonized water) and clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 15 days and 30 days.", "When the comparison of mean values of Plaque Index and Gingival Index between the groups and at different time intervals were made, statistically significant difference were observed at 30 days at 5% level. When the mean values of clinical attachment level on mesial and distal site was compared between the groups, statistical significance was observed at 5% level and 1% level respectively.Similarly statistical significance at 5% level was observed at 15 and 30 days on buccal site.", "Subgingival irrigation with ozonized water is beneficial adjunct treatment modality to enhance periodontal health with significant role in periodontal therapy.
