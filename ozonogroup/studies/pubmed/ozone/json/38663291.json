Creating efficient and stable performance catalysts for high-salinity wastewater treatment is vital in catalytic ozonation process. Compared with ozonation alone, Mn and Ce co-doped \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> could remarkably enhance activities of catalytic ozonation for chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (38.9%) of brine derived from a two-stage reverse osmosis treatment. Experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that introducing Mn could increase the active points of catalyst surface, and introducing Ce could optimize d-band electronic structures and promote the electron transport capacity, enhancing HO<sup>\u2022</sup> bound to the catalyst surface ([HO<sup>\u2022</sup>]<sub>ads</sub>) generation. [HO<sup>\u2022</sup>]<sub>ads</sub> plays key roles for degrading the intermediates and transfer them into low molecular weight organics, and further decrease COD, molecular weights and number of organics in reverse osmosis concentrate. Under the same reaction conditions, the presence of Mn/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst can reduce \u0394O<sub>3</sub>/\u0394COD by at least 37.6% compared to ozonation alone. Furthermore, Mn-Ce/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalytic ozonation can reduce the \u0394O<sub>3</sub>/\u0394COD from 2.6 of Mn/\u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalytic ozonation to 0.9 in the case of achieving similar COD removal. Catalytic ozonation has the potential to treat reverse osmosis concentrate derived from bio-treated coking wastewater reclamation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
