The results showed that there were two pathways for the degradation of MC-LR by ozone. The first one is that the diene structure in Adda side chain was attacked and cleaved, which was named as Adda degradation pathway. The second one is that the pathway of Mdha and Ala degradation, which was that the peptide bond between Mdha and Ala was attacked and cleaved. Adda degradation pathway was dominant and mainly responsible for the degradation of MC-LR byozone. The removal of MC-LR by ozone could reach 92% when O3:MC is 6."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and Civil Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214122, China. hfmiao@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Heng-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Li-Juan", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Wen-Quan", "Initials": "WQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EQ8332842Y", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin LR"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eutrophication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20063742"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
