Here, we studied the reaction of ozone (O3) with NaBr solutions in the presence and absence of citric acid (C6H8O7) under ambient conditions. Citric acid is used as a proxy for oxidized organic material present at the ocean surface or in sea spray aerosol. On neat NaBr solutions, the observed kinetics is consistent with bulk reaction-limited uptake, and a second-order rate constant for the reaction of O3 + Br(-) is 57 \u00b1 10 M(-1) s(-1). On mixed NaBr-citric acid aqueous solutions, the uptake kinetics was faster than that predicted by bulk reaction-limited uptake and also faster than expected based on an acid-catalyzed mechanism. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a liquid microjet of the same solutions at 1.0 \u00d7 10(-3)-1.0 \u00d7 10(-4) mbar was used to obtain quantitative insight into the interfacial composition relative to that of the bulk solutions. It revealed that the bromide anion becomes depleted by 30 \u00b1 10% while the sodium cation gets enhanced by 40 \u00b1 20% at the aqueous solution-air interface of a 0.12 M NaBr solution mixed with 2.5 M citric acid in the bulk, attributed to the role of citric acid as a weak surfactant. Therefore, the enhanced reactivity of bromide solutions observed in the presence of citric acid is not necessarily attributable to a surface reaction but could also result from an increased solubility of ozone at higher citric acid concentrations. Whether the acid-catalyzed chemistry may have a larger effect on the surface than in the bulk to offset the effect of bromide depletion also remains open."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Laboratory of Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ming-Tao", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Matthew A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Laboratory of Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "Shunsuke", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Laboratory of Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Kleibert", "ForeName": "Armin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Laboratory of Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "T\u00fcrler", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Laboratory of Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, 5232 Villigen PSI, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Ammann", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2968PHW8QP", "NameOfSubstance": "Citric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LC1V549NOM", "NameOfSubstance": "sodium bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Citric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oceans and Seas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoelectron Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25530167", "10.1021/jp510707s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
