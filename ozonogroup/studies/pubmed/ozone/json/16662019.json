Bonanza and Monarch Advance) which differ in foliar ozone sensitivity. No significant differences were observed in stomatal frequencies, guard cell lengths, or conductances to water vapor diffusion.When plant water status was compared, leaf-water potentials for the ozone-resistant cultivar, Bonanza, were lower. A comparison of the relationship between soil- and leaf-water potential indicated that the leaf-water potential of Bonanza was more sensitive to declines in soil-water potential. Additionally, a comparison of stomatal conductance to water vapor diffusion as soil moisture declined and following root detachment indicated that stomata of Bonanza were, likewise, more sensitive to increasing water stress. Data suggest that these differences are attributable to a greater shoot-to-root fresh weight ratio and higher resistance to water movement in the water-conducting tissues for Bonanza.Our observations suggest that root and water delivery system characteristics play a major contributory role in the determination of foliar ozone sensitivity in this species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California, Riverside, California 92521."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harris", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heath", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1965 Oct;54(4):1044-51", "ArticleIdList": ["5219815"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1961 Sep;47(9):1423-33", "ArticleIdList": ["16590880"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1973 May;51(5):914-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16658439"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1970 Aug;46(2):236-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16657442"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1971 Nov;48(5):613-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16657846"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1971 Dec;48(6):783-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16657880"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16662019", "PMC426006", "10.1104/pp.68.4.885"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
