The resulting films were characterized with x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The stoichiometry and surface crystallinity of the WO(x) thin films were subsequently modulated upon ozone exposure and thermal annealing without particle growth. The electrochromic performance was studied in a LiClO(4)-propylene carbonate electrolyte, and the results suggest that the low-temperature ozone exposure technique is superior to the traditional high-temperature thermal annealing (employed to more fully oxidize the WO(x)). The optical modulation at 670\u00a0nm was improved from 35% for the as-deposited film to 57% for the film after ozone exposure at 150\u2009\u00b0C. The coloration efficiency was improved and the switching speed to the darkened state was significantly accelerated from 18.0\u00a0s for the as-deposited film to 11.8\u00a0s for the film after the ozone exposure. The process opens an avenue for low-temperature and cost-effective manufacturing of electrochromic films, especially on flexible polymer substrates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO 80401, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chi-Ping", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tenent", "ForeName": "Robert C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolden", "ForeName": "Colin A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gillaspie", "ForeName": "Dane T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dillon", "ForeName": "Anne C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richards", "ForeName": "Ryan M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Engtrakul", "ForeName": "Chaiwat", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22653083", "10.1088/0957-4484/23/25/255601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
