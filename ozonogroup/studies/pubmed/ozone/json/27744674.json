To evaluate the risk of ED visits for asthma related to ambient air pollutants (carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], ozone [O<sub>3</sub>], sulfur dioxide [SO<sub>2</sub>], and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <10 \u03bcm [PM<sub>10</sub>]), a generalized additive model with a Poisson distribution was used; a single-lag model and a cumulative-effect model (average concentration over the previous 1-7 days) were also explored. The percent increase and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each interquartile range (IQR) increment in the concentration of each air pollutant. Subgroup analyses were done by age, gender, the presence of allergic disease, and season.", "A total of 33 751 asthma attack cases were observed during the study period. The strongest association was a 9.6% increase (95% CI, 6.9% to 12.3%) in the risk of ED visits for asthma per IQR increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration. IQR changes in NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations were also significantly associated with ED visits in the cumulative lag 7 model. Among patients with a prior history of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis, the risk of ED visits for asthma per IQR increase in PM<sub>10</sub> concentration was higher (3.9%; 95% CI, 1.2% to 6.7%) than in patients with no such history.", "Ambient air pollutants were positively associated with ED visits for asthma, especially among subjects with a prior history of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0657-0082"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Noh", "ForeName": "Juhwan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "Jungwoo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Gachon University Gil Hospital, Incheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Jaelim", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Informatics and Biostatistics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Seong-Kyung", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yoon Jung", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5940-5649"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Changsoo", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Dong Chun", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Prev Med Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101242972", "ISSNLinking": "1975-8375"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have no conflicts of interest associated with the material presented in this paper."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Oh IH, Yoon SJ, Kim EJ.
