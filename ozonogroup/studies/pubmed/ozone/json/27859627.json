These reactions lead to lower indoor than outdoor ozone concentrations when outdoor air is the major contributor to indoor ozone. However, the products of indoor ozone reactions may be irritating or harmful to building occupants. While active technologies exist to reduce indoor ozone concentrations (i.e, in-duct filtration using activated carbon), they can be cost-prohibitive for some and/or infeasible for dwellings that do not have heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems. In this study, the potential for passive reduction of indoor ozone by two different clay-based interior surface coatings was explored. These coatings were exposed to occupied residential indoor environments and tested bimonthly in environmental chambers for quantification of ozone reaction probabilities and reaction product emission rates over a 6-month period. Results indicate that clay-based coatings may be effective as passive removal materials, with relatively low by-product emission rates that decay rapidly within 2\u00a0months."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
