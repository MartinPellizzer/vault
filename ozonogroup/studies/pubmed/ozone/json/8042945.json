We measured respiratory illness in the previous year by questionnaire, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) by histamine inhalation test, and atopy by skin prick tests. 'Current asthma' was defined as AHR and recent wheeze.", "Recordings of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, hydrogen sulphide, ozone and particulates during the study period showed that the level of pollutants did not vary in any major way between the study regions and the control region. The prevalence of current asthma, atopy, symptom frequency or any category of severity of asthma illness was not significantly different between the control and study regions.", "This suggests that factors other than intermittent or industrial air pollutants are responsible for the high prevalence of asthma symptoms, asthma medication use, asthma morbidity and AHR in the study of children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Sydney, NSW."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peat", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mellis", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrington", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woolcock", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust N Z J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "1264322", "ISSNLinking": "0004-8291"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8042945", "10.1111/j.1445-5994.1994.tb00553.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
