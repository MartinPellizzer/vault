We present measured wavelength-resolved photon fluxes and distance dependences of indoor light sources including halogen, incandescent, and compact fluorescent lights (CFL) commonly used in residential buildings; fluorescent tubes common in industrial and commercial settings; and sunlight entering buildings through windows. We use these measurements to predict indoor HO<sub>x</sub> production rates from the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), formaldehyde (HCHO), and acetaldehyde (CH<sub>3</sub>CHO). Our results suggest that while most lamps can photolyze these molecules, only sunlight and fluorescent tubes will be important to room-averaged indoor HO<sub>x</sub> levels due to the strong distance dependence of the fluxes from compact bulbs. Under ambient conditions, we predict that sunlight and fluorescent lights will photolyze HONO to form OH at rates of 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and that fluorescent lights will photolyze HCHO to form HO<sub>2</sub> at rates of \u223c10<sup>6</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; rates could be 2 orders of magnitude higher under high precursor concentrations. Ozone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will not be important photochemical OH sources under most conditions, and CH<sub>3</sub>CHO will generally increase HO<sub>2</sub> production rates only slightly. We also calculated photolysis rate constants for nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrate radicals (NO<sub>3</sub>) in the presence of the different light sources. Photolysis is not likely an important fate for NO<sub>3</sub> indoors, but NO<sub>2</sub> photolysis could be an important source of indoor O<sub>3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1-014 Center for Science and Technology, Syracuse University 111 College Place Syracuse, New York 13244, United States."}], "LastName": "Kowal", "ForeName": "Shawn F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1-014 Center for Science and Technology, Syracuse University 111 College Place Syracuse, New York 13244, United States."}], "LastName": "Allen", "ForeName": "Seth R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5074-1155"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1-014 Center for Science and Technology, Syracuse University 111 College Place Syracuse, New York 13244, United States."}], "LastName": "Kahan", "ForeName": "Tara F", "Initials": "TF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2018 Oct 16;52(20):11964-11965. doi: 10.1021/acs.est.8b03960", "PMID": "30280887"}, {"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2018 Oct 16;52(20):11966-11967. doi: 10.1021/acs.est.8b04908", "PMID": "30281283"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28805371", "10.1021/acs.est.7b02015"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
