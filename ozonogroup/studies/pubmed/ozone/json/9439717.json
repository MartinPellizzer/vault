To examine the role of these cytokines in neutrophil chemotaxis, cytokine mRNA transcripts and content were examined in macrophages lavaged from rats immediately following 6 hr exposure to air or 1 ppm ozone. Ozone exposure enhanced the number of lavaged macrophages demonstrating mRNA transcripts and immunocytochemical staining for IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. These changes occurred prior to ozone-induced increases in permeability and lavageable neutrophils. The supernatant from in vitro macrophage cultures demonstrated ozone-associated enhancements in neutrophil chemotactic activity and in IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels. However, treatment of the macrophage-conditioned media with anti-IL-1 beta and anti-TNF-alpha antibodies separately and in combination demonstrated that these cytokines were not directly responsible for the observed neutrophil chemoattraction. However, coculturing the macrophages with anti-IL-1 beta and anti-TNF-alpha together, but not separately, resulted in a 44% inhibition of media chemotactic activity, suggesting that maximal macrophage generation of chemoattractants was dependent on either IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha. The mRNA transcripts for the neutrophil chemoattractants macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) were found to be enhanced in cultured macrophages from ozone-exposed rats, but reduced on incubation with anti-IL-1 beta and anti-TNF-alpha together. These results demonstrated that ozone-induced enhancements in IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha productions appear not to be associated directly with neutrophil chemoattraction, but are more likely involved in stimulating the generation of the neutrophil chemoattractants MIP-2 and CINC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nomura", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hasegawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirata", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassett", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-05255", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-34674", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9439717", "10.1006/taap.1997.8275", "S0041-008X(97)98275-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
