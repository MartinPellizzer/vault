It has been shown that there is a consistent association in summer between hospital admissions for respiratory disease in Southern Ontario, and daily levels of SO4, O3, and temperature. No association exists for a group nonrespiratory conditions. Multiple regression analyses are presented that show all environmental variables account for 5.6% of the variability in respiratory admissions and that if temperature is forced into the analysis first, it accounts for 0.89% of the variability only. Distribution plots of standardized residuals are presented. In June of 1983, there were an exceptional number of ozone episodes (defined as occasions when ozone was greater than 82 ppb for 3 or more hours in a calendar day) in this region. A separate analysis of hospital admissions for acute respiratory diseases for the month of June for several years shows no demonstrable excess in June of 1983; previously regional analyses have indicated that ozone is associated with increased levels in July and August over a 9-year period. It has also been found that daily SO4 data collected at one monitoring site in the center of the region are not correlated with respiratory admissions, whereas the SO4 values collected every sixth day, on different days of the week, at 17 stations in the region had the highest correlation with respiratory admissions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Care and Epidemiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sizto", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Rain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Rain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ontario"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Can J Public Health. 1983 Mar-Apr;74(2):117-22", "ArticleIdList": ["6850488"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1987 Aug;43(2):317-31", "ArticleIdList": ["3608935"]}, {"Citation": "Am Rev Respir Dis. 1985 Oct;132(4):875-9", "ArticleIdList": ["4051323"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2785033", "PMC1567582", "10.1289/ehp.897969"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
