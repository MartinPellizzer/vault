To this purpose, the environmental effects of both procedures (EKSFs and EKABs) have been determined through a life cycle assessment (LCA). SimaPro 9.3.0.3 was used as software tool and Ecoinvent 3.3 as data base to carry out the inventory of the equipment of each remediation setup based on experimental measurements. The environmental burden was quantified using the AWARE, USEtox, IPPC, and ReCiPe methods into 3 Endpoint impact categories (and damage to human health, ecosystem and resources) and 7 Midpoints impact categories (water footprint, global warming potential, ozone depletion, human toxicity (cancer and human non-cancer), freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity). In general terms, the energy applied to treatment (using the Spanish energy mix) was the parameter with the greatest influence on the carbon footprint, ozone layer depletion and water footprint accounting for around 70\u00a0% of the overall impact contribution. On the other hand, from the point of view of human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity of soil treatments with 32\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> of the different pesticides, the EKSF treatment is recommended for soils with Chlorosulfuron. In this case, the carbon footprint and water footprint reached values around 0.36\u00a0kg of CO<sub>2</sub> and 114\u00a0L of water per kg of dry soil, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed assuming different scenarios."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
