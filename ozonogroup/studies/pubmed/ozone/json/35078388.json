Person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets and contact with aerosol-infected surfaces are the main ways in which the virus spreads. However, according to the updated literature, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has also been detected in aqueous matrices, with the main route of transmission being feces and masks from patients diagnosed with the disease. Given the emergence of public health and environmental protection from the presence of lethal viruses and bacteria, this review article aims to report the major challenges associated with the application of ozonation in water contaminated with viruses and bacteria, in order to clarify whether these communities can survive or infect after the disinfection process and if it is efficient. Available data suggest that ozonation is able to increase the inactivation effect of microorganisms by about 50% in the logarithmic range, reducing infectivity. In addition, the evidence-based knowledge reported in this article is useful to support water and sanitation safety planning and to protect human health from exposure to cited contaminants through water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6812-8022"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "Let\u00edcia Reggiane de Carvalho", "Initials": "LRC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5900-4474"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "F\u00e9ris", "ForeName": "Liliana Amaral", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35078388", "10.1080/09593330.2022.2034981"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
