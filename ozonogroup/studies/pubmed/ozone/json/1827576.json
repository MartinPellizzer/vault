Airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine was determined by modified Astograph (7 Hz oscillation method), and numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood, neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the levels of TxB2 and 6-keto-Prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) in BALF were measured before and after ozone exposure, and after ozone exposure with pretreated AA-2414. Ozone exposure was carried out for 2 hr at an ozone level of 3.06 +/- 0.06 ppm (mean +/- SE). Airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine increased significantly after ozone exposure (p less than 0.01), and the hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone exposure was inhibited significantly by pretreated AA-2414 (p less than 0.01). Numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and neutrophil counts in BALF increased after ozone exposure, and these increase were not inhibited by pretreated AA-2414. There was no apparent change in the levels of TxB2 in BALF after ozone exposure and after ozone exposure with pretreated AA-2414, however the levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in BALF decreased after ozone exposure and after ozone exposure with pretreated AA-2414 (p less than 0.1). These results suggest that TxA2 plays an important role in the development of airway responsiveness after ozone exposure in dogs, and ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness may not be associated with the hyperproduction of TxA2 but with the relative increase of TxA2 due to the decrease of PGI2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Showa University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adachi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Idaira", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suganuma", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuji", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Arerugi", "NlmUniqueID": "0241212", "ISSNLinking": "0021-4884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heptanoic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Prostaglandin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Thromboxane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4U58JM421N", "NameOfSubstance": "seratrodast"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57576-52-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane A2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heptanoic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Prostaglandin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Thromboxane"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane A2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1827576"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
