Current retrieval schemes for this temperature have several shortcomings, which can be overcome by using an optimal estimation method (OEM). Forward models are presented that completely characterize the measurement and allow the simultaneous retrieval of temperature, dead time, and background. The method allows a full uncertainty budget to be obtained on a per profile basis that includes, in addition to the statistical uncertainties, the smoothing error and uncertainties due to Rayleigh extinction, ozone absorption, lidar constant, nonlinearity in the counting system, variation of the Rayleigh-scatter cross section with altitude, pressure, acceleration due to gravity, and the variation of mean molecular mass with altitude. The vertical resolution of the temperature profile is found at each height, and a quantitative determination is made of the maximum height to which the retrieval is valid. A single temperature profile can be retrieved from measurements with multiple channels that cover different height ranges, vertical resolutions, and even different detection methods. The OEM employed is shown to give robust estimates of temperature, which are consistent with previous methods, while requiring minimal computational time. This demonstrated success of lidar temperature retrievals using an OEM opens new possibilities in atmospheric science for measurement integration between active and passive remote sensing instruments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sica", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haefele", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25968361", "10.1364/AO.54.001872", "312547"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
