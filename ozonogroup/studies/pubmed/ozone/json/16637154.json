Since January 1st 2005, it has been phased-out in industrialized countries, where only critical uses are allowed, because of international regulatory measures designed to reduce substances that potentially deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. Italy ranked second in the world, after USA, in MB consumption, due to the importance of horticultural crop production. In order to replace the use of MB, research in Italy was aimed at: a) reducing the use of MB and its emission (short-term goal); b) developing alternative pest control methods, based on available technologies (mid-term goal); c) developing new MB alternatives (mid- and long-term goal). Italian growers switched to other fumigants, applied at reduced dosages, lowering their environmental impact and risk of worker exposure. Moreover, the adoption of non-chemical alternatives slowly but steadily increased as a result of the many activities (demonstration trials, seminars, etc.) carried out in the country. The gradual shift to MB alternatives over a 10 year period, as well as the use of half rates of MB under virtually impermeable plastic films (VIFs), has generally prevented the feared loss of competitiveness of Italian horticulture. Extension in cooperation with the fumigation companies was able to provide growers with a range of methods for soil disinfestation. The experience gained in Italy and how it can help developing countries to define strategies and training programmes needed to comply with the Montreal Protocol is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Competence for the Innovation in the Agro-environmental Sector (AGROINNOVA), University of Torino, Via Leonardo da Vinci 44, I-10095 Grugliasco, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gullino", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clini", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garibaldi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Commun Agric Appl Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101200320", "ISSNLinking": "1379-1176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}], "NumberOfReferences": "72"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16637154"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
