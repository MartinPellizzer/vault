The calculated weights of the various VB structures and their individual diabatic energies are found to be consistent with each other. All 1,3-dipoles can be described in terms of three major VB structures, one diradical and two zwitterionic ones, out of the six structures, forming a complete basis. Ozone has a rather large diradical character, estimated to 44%-49%. SOO and SOS are even more diradicalar, whereas SSO and especially OSO are better described as closed-shell zwitterions. Moreover, the description of 1,3-dipoles, in terms of the three major structures, yields VB weights in full agreement with simple chemical wisdom, i.e., a diradical weight of 33% when the three structures are quasi-degenerate, and a smaller (larger) value when the diradical structure is higher (lower) in energy than the zwitterionic ones. Therefore, the VB-calculated weight of the diradical structure of a molecule qualifies itself as a quantitative measure of diradical character, and not only as an indicator of tendencies. Other definitions of the diradical character, based on molecular orbital/configuration interaction methods, are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 06, CNRS UMR 7616 , Laboratoire de Chimie Th\u00e9orique, Case Courrier 137, 4 Place Jussieu, 75252 Paris, France."}], "LastName": "Bra\u00efda", "ForeName": "Beno\u00eet", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5018-4643"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Filosofia, Ci\u00eancias e Letras de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo , 14040-901, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto - SP Brazil."}], "LastName": "Galembeck", "ForeName": "S\u00e9rgio E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7081-4654"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie Physique, Groupe de Chimie Th\u00e9orique, CNRS UMR 8000, Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Sud , 91405 Orsay C\u00e9dex, France."}], "LastName": "Hiberty", "ForeName": "Philippe C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28590736", "10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00399"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
