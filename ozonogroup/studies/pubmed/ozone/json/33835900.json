In New York State, significant emission reductions occurred during the past decades due to fuel switching, increased renewable energy, and transformations in buildings and transportation. Between 2002 and 2018, anthropogenic emissions of CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, VOCs, and primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> declined by 58%, 61%, 89%, 47%, and 29%, respectively, in New York and three adjoining states. Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentrations decreased but contributions of source types to changes in PM<sub>2.5</sub> elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) are incompletely understood. Receptor modeling was used to estimate changing source contributions to EC and OC in New York City (NYC) between 2007 and 2019. Source identification was facilitated by incorporating measurements of CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2,</sub> and speciated hydrocarbons (1,3-butadiene, n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane, isopentane, isoprene, benzene, toluene, xylenes, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde). Hydrocarbon species identified mobile-source emissions, evaporative emissions, biogenics, and photochemical secondary organic aerosol. At three study locations, predicted reductions of TC (OC + EC) summed over all source types were 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>, compared with a measured TC reduction of 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>. Declining sulfate concentrations and cleaner mobile sources together reduced the predicted average TC by a combined 1\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>. Smaller changes occurred in other source contributions, e.g., 0.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> reduction likely in response to NYC regulations related to heating fuel oil. Biomass burning PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased between 2007 and 2011, then declined between 2015 and 2019. Reductions contrast with a non-significant increase of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> in photochemical TC. Further opportunities to decrease PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations include wood burning and photochemical-related OC. Continued temporal analysis and source apportionment will be needed to track changes in air quality and source contributions as jurisdictions expand renewable energy and energy efficiency goals.<i>Implications</i>: Large emission reductions that occurred in the eastern U.S. between 2002 and 2019 lowered average fine particle concentrations in New York City by a factor of two. Secondary organic aerosol concentrations declined as sulfate decreased but increased non-significantly with rising ozone. Cleaner mobile-source emissions lowered elemental and organic carbon concentrations. Opportunities for further reductions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations include biomass burning and photochemical secondary aerosol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Envair, Albany, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Blanchard", "ForeName": "Charles L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Shaw", "ForeName": "Stephanie L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Research & Analysis, Cary, NC, USA."}], "LastName": "Edgerton", "ForeName": "Eric S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, State University of New York, Albany, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Schwab", "ForeName": "James J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York City"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33835900", "10.1080/10962247.2021.1914773"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
