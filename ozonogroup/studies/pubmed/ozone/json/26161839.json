Occupational exposure to 1-BP is associated with adverse peripheral sensory, motor, and central nervous system (CNS) effects. We report our Health Hazard and Medical Evaluation of 6 patients with neurotoxicity associated with occupational exposure to 1-BP. Case series and environmental evaluation. Six workers, 1 male and 5 female, were exposed to high ambient 1-BP concentrations while employed in a golf club cleaning factory. 1-BP was identified in the bulk solvent sample used by the workers and confirmed the workers' daily occupational exposure to 1-BP for 3-10 months. The major presenting symptoms were tingling pain, soreness in lower extremities, and paresthesia. N-acetyl-S-(n-propyl)-L-cysteine (AcPrCys), a 1-BP metabolite, was identified by LC/MS/MS in the urine (0.171-1.74 mg/g-Cr) of these workers 5-26 days following 1-BP exposure.", "An occupational outbreak of 1-BP poisoning occurred as a result of recurrent power outages, condenser, and exhaust fans malfunction, and inadequate personal protection. Occupational exposure to 1-BP may result in peripheral neuropathy as well as adverse CNS effects. Urine AcPrCys may be a specific biomarker for 1-BP exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Toxicology and Occupational Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Te-Hao", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Ling", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ya-Hsueh", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Wen-Jen", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Kon-Ping", "Initials": "KP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chao-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chen-Chang", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Jou-Fang", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Toxicol (Phila)", "NlmUniqueID": "101241654", "ISSNLinking": "1556-3650"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "N-acetyl-S-propylcysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9746DNE68", "NameOfSubstance": "1-bromopropane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Golf"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxicity Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sports Equipment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26161839", "10.3109/15563650.2015.1064939"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
