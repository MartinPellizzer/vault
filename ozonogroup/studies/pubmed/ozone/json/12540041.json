To detect the O3 trend caused by changes in precursor emissions, moving average filters and a linear least-squared regression model were used to eliminate the short-term variation and effects of temperature from raw time-series O3 data. The results showed a significant decrease in the number of days exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and a small change in total O3 concentration. The analysis indicated that the variation of daily maximum O3, caused by changes in emissions, explained more than 10% of the total O3 variation in Bridgeport and East Hartford during the past 17 years. Meanwhile, a strong weekly cycle was also found in O3 time-series data, resulting in lower O3 concentration in urban areas than in nonurban areas, implying that land use and land cover have impacts on the spatial distribution of ground-level O3 in Connecticut."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Resources Science, University of Rhode Island, Coastal Institute, Kingston, Rhode Island 02881, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jiansheng", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "David R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Connecticut"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12540041", "10.1080/10473289.2002.10470876"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
