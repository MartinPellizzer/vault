The interactive effect of sample particle size and moisture content on ozonolysis was studied. After ozonolysis, both lignin and xylan decreased while cellulose was only slightly affected in all experiments. It was also found that the smaller particle size is better for ozonolysis. The similar water activity of the different optimum moisture contents for ozonolysis reveals that the free and bound water ratio is a key factor of ozonolysis. The best result of ozonolysis was obtained at the mesh of -300 and the moisture of 60%, where up to 75% lignin was removed. The glucose yield after enzymatic hydrolysis increased from 18.5% to 80%. Water washing had low impact on glucose yield (less than 10% increases), but significantly reduced xylose yield (up to 42% decreases). The result indicates that ozonolysis leads to xylan solubilization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
