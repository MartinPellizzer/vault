The study was conducted from the beginning of May through the end of August during 2000 and 2001 using an open-top chamber research facility located within the Lattecaldo Cantonal Forest Nursery in Canton Ticino, southern Switzerland (600 m asl). Plants were examined daily and dates of initial foliar injury were recorded in order to determine the cumulative AOT40 ppb h ozone exposure required to cause visible foliar injury. Plant responses to ozone varied significantly among species; 11 species exhibited visible symptoms typical of exposures to ambient ozone. The symptomatic species (from most to least sensitive) were Populus nigra, Viburnum lantana, Salix alba, Crataegus monogyna, Viburnum opulus, Tilia platyphyllos, Cornus alba, Prunus avium, Fraxinus excelsior, Ribes alpinum, and Tilia cordata; Clematis spp. did not show foliar symptoms. Of the 11 symptomatic species, five showed initial injury below the critical level AOT40 10 ppmh O3 in the 2001 season."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The Pennsylvania State University, 108 Buckhout Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Novak", "ForeName": "Kristopher", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skelly", "ForeName": "John M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schaub", "ForeName": "Marcus", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kr\u00e4uchi", "ForeName": "Norbert", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hug", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landolt", "ForeName": "Werner", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bleuler", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12804826", "10.1016/s0269-7491(03)00085-x", "S026974910300085X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
