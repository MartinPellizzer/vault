A direct injection, ion chromatographic method was developed using a tetraborate eluent with serially connected conductivity and spectrophotometric detection. Bromate was detected after post-column reaction with fuchsin at 520 nm. Sample capacity was investigated by injecting large volumes (up to 6 ml) using a high total hardness and chloride tap water. Linear correlation of bromate response with volumes from 1 ml to 6 ml was demonstrated, the main limitation being the overlapping of the chloride peak with bromate. Up to 1.5 ml sample can be injected without any pre-treatment. With more than 1.5 ml injection volume, a sample pre-treatment with a cartridge in Ag and H form, followed by a 10 min degassing in an ultrasonic bath, was needed. This method was validated by analysing secondary reference materials and real samples from a drinking water treatment plant. The method was linear from the limit of quantification to 20 microg l(-1). Reproducibilities in tap water were 18% (5 microg l(-1), n=12) and 21% (1 microg l(-1), n=4) respectively for 1.5 and 6 ml injection volumes with conductivity detection, and 17% at 0.5 microg l(-1) (n=9) with spectrophotometric detection. Calculated detection limits were 0.5 microg l(-1) (6 ml) ahd 2 microg l(-1) (1.5 ml) for conductivity detection and 0.3 microg l(-1) (1.5 ml) for spectrophotometric detection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNR-IRSA, Brugherio, Italy. valsecchi@server-mi.irsa.rm.cnr.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valsecchi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isernia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polesello", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cavalli", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10669294", "10.1016/s0021-9673(99)01010-9", "S0021-9673(99)01010-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
