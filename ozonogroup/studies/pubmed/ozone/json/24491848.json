One hundred and twelve male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups of 14 rats each; seven groups were experimental (A-G) and one formed the control group (K). The experimental groups were further divided into two sub-groups, with seven rats in each - sacrificed on days 14 and 28 (subgroups 1 and 2). The maxillary right central incisors were extracted under general anaesthesia following the administration of local anaesthesia. After sacrifice, semi-serial histological sections were prepared, and mineralized and trabecular bone and osteoid and osteoblast surfaces were measured. Measurements of the trabecular bone showed statistically higher values in the groups treated with systemic ozone (D(2): 50.01 \u00b1 2.12; E(2): 49.03 \u00b1 3.03; F(2): 48.76 \u00b1 2.61; G(2): 50.24 \u00b1 3.37) than in the groups that underwent topical ozone administration (A(2): 46.01 \u00b1 3.07; B(2): 46.79 \u00b1 3.09; C(2): 47.07 \u00b1 2.12; P = 0.030 (G(2)-A(2), G(2)-B(2), G(2)-C(2))). Within the limitations of the current study, it may be concluded that postoperative long-term systemic ozone application can accelerate alveolar bone healing following extraction. However, additional studies are required to clarify the effects of the different ozone applications on new bone formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.
