Materials and methods Each group comprised 15 samples of maxillary first premolar pre-adjusted edgewise SS movable, un-bonded brackets (Koden Inc., United States) which were welded with a power arm, where 100 g\u00a0of the load was suspended. Brackets were ligated with elastic modules (Koden Inc., United States) onto the perspex sheet along with 0.019\" x 0.025\" SS archwire (Classic Orthodontics, United States) and were suspended from the upper component of the Instron machine. The coefficient of friction was tested in dry conditions (control), artificial saliva (AS) (Wet Mouth, ICPA Health Product Ltd., India), 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) mouthwash (Hexidine, ICPA Health Product Ltd., India), 0.05% sodium fluoride (NaF) mouthwash (ACT Anti-Cavity Fluoride Mouthwash, Sanofi Company, United States), charcoal (CC) mouthwash (Hello Activated Charcoal Extra Freshening Mouthwash, Hello Products LLC, United States) and ozone-infused oil-pulling solution with coconut oil (O<sub>3</sub>) (O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0Essentials, Health Ranger Store, United States). In order to calculate the coefficient of friction, 50 L was added<i>\u00a0</i>to the test sample while moving at a 5 mm/min crosshead speed. The groups were compared using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey's post hoc analysis was performed for multiple pairwise comparisons. Results The coefficient of friction with the highest mean values was observed with the control group (2.01), followed by AS (1.79), and the least with O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0(1.15). Statistically significant differences were observed with almost all groups of mouth rinsing agents, but NaF is significant with CHG and CC. However, CHG did not have any significant difference from CC. Conclusions Lower coefficient of frictional values were observed with the ozone-infused oil-pulling solution with coconut oil during sliding mechanics between metal brackets and stainless steel archwire. Almost all the mouth rinsing agents showed a significantly different coefficient of friction value."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Himabindu et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Himabindu", "ForeName": "Datla", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Venkata Prasanna", "ForeName": "Pappala", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Vamsi Krishna Reddy", "ForeName": "Vazrala", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hopital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Farhatulla", "ForeName": "Shaik", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, GSL Dental College & Hospital, Rajahmundry, IND."}], "LastName": "Raghu Ram", "ForeName": "Rsvm", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Friction - boon or bane in orthodontics.
