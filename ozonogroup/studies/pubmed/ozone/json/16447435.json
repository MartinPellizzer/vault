It was found that the processes of modified ceramic honeycomb and ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation could increase the removal efficiency of nitrobenzene by 38.35% and 15.46%, respectively, compared with that achieved by ozonation alone. Under the conditions of this experiment, the degradation rate of modified ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation increased by 30.55% with the increase of amount of catalyst to 5 blocks. The degradation rate of three process all increased greatly with the increase of temperature and value of pH in the solution. But when raising the pH value of the solution to 10.00, the advantage of modified ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation processes lost. The experimental results indicate that in modified ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation, nitrobenzene is primarily oxidized by *OH free radical in aqueous solution. The adsorption of nitrobenzene is too limited to have any influence on the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene. With the same total dosage of applied ozone, the multiple steps addition of ozone showed a much higher removal efficiency than that obtained by one step in three processes. Modified ceramic honeycomb had a relative longer lifetime."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16447435"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
