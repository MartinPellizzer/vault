This article estimates the health costs associated with six climate change-related events that struck the United States between 2000 and 2009. The six case studies came from categories of climate change-related events projected to worsen with continued global warming-ozone pollution, heat waves, hurricanes, infectious disease outbreaks, river flooding, and wildfires. We estimate that the health costs exceeded $14\u00a0billion, with 95\u00a0percent due to the value of lives lost prematurely. Actual health care costs were an estimated $740\u00a0million. This reflects more than 760,000 encounters with the health care system. Our analysis provides scientists and policy makers with a methodology to use in estimating future health costs related to climate change and highlights the growing need for public health preparedness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health and Environment Program, Natural Resources Defense Council, New York City, NY, USA. kknowlton@nrdc.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knowlton", "ForeName": "Kim", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rotkin-Ellman", "ForeName": "Miriam", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geballe", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Max", "ForeName": "Wendy", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "Gina M", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Health Aff (Millwood)", "NlmUniqueID": "8303128", "ISSNLinking": "0278-2715"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Disasters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Outbreaks"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Floods"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Health Care Costs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22068410", "10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0229", "30/11/2167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
