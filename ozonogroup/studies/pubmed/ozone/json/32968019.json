In this study, we analyze the effects of vehicle emission control measures on ambient air pollution and associated deaths attributable to long-term exposures of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> based on an integrated research framework that combines scenario analysis, air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment. We find that the total impact of these control measures was substantial. Vehicular emissions during 1998-2015 would have been 2-3 times as large as they actually were, had those measures not been implemented. The national population-weighted annual average concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in 2015 would have been higher by 11.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 8.3 parts per billion, respectively, and the number of deaths attributable to 2015 air pollution would have been higher by 510 thousand (95% confidence interval: 360 thousand to 730 thousand) without these controls. Our analysis shows a concentration of mortality impacts in densely populated urban areas, motivating local policymakers to design stringent vehicle emission control policies. The results imply that vehicle emission control will require policy designs that are more multifaceted than traditional controls, primarily represented by the strict emission standards, with careful consideration of the challenges in coordinated mitigation of both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in different regions, to sustain improvement in air quality and public health given continuing swift growth in China's vehicle population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2565-5543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Atmospheric and Earth System Sciences, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, 210023 Nanjing, People's Republic of China; wanghk@nju.edu.cn zhsjun@tsinghua.edu.cn ywu@tsinghua.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, 210023 Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Haikun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University, 210023 Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xiaojing", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment and State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Tsinghua University, 100084 Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xinyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard T.H.
