Theoretical calculations of some of the proposed reaction intermediates and products were carried out using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs, applying density functional theory (DFT), the B3LYP functional, and the 6-311G++(d,2p) basis set. In the \u03b1-pinene/ozone system, the thermal reaction between \u03b1-pinene and ozone was too slow to observe under the twin-jet or merged-jet deposition conditions of these experiments. However, red light (\u03bb \u2265 600 nm) irradiation of the argon matrixes containing \u03b1-pinene and ozone caused new infrared peaks to appear that could be readily assigned to reaction products of \u03b1-pinene with O((3)P) resulting from ozone photolysis: \u03b1-pinene oxide (with an epoxide ring) and two isomeric ketones. Norbornene and norbornadiene were both found to react with ozone in the gas phase during twin-jet or merged-jet deposition of these mixtures with argon. New peaks observed in the infrared spectra were assigned to the primary ozonides, Criegee intermediates, and secondary ozonides of norbornene and norbornadiene, indicating that the bulk of these reactions proceeded via the \"classic\" Criegee mechanism for ozonolysis of alkenes. Calculated infrared frequencies and molecular energies support these conclusions. Ultraviolet irradiation of these mixtures resulted in complete decomposition of the early intermediates and the formation of acids, aldehydes, alcohols, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. In any case, no evidence for \"unusual\" chemistry, prompted by the bicyclic nature of the reactants, was observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio 45221, United States."}], "LastName": "Kugel", "ForeName": "Roger W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ault", "ForeName": "Bruce S", "Initials": "BS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25495369", "10.1021/jp510883k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
