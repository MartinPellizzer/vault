The objective of this study was to determine whether sublethal aqueous ozone treatment (3 ppm of O3 for 5 min) of microorganisms on beef surfaces would result in increased or decreased survival with respect to subsequent heat, alkali, or NaCl stress. A mild heat treatment (55 degrees C for 30 min) was used for comparison. Reductions in three-strain cocktails of Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes on beef following the heat treatment were 0.14, 0.77, and 1.47 log10 CFU/g, respectively, whereas reductions following ozone treatment were 1.28, 0.85, and 1.09 log10 CFU/g, respectively. C. perfringens cells exhibited elevated heat resistance at 60 degrees C (D60 [time at 60 degrees C required to reduce the viable cell population by 1 log10 units or 90%] = 17.76 min) following heat treatment of beef (55 degrees C for 30 min) but exhibited reduced viability at 60 degrees C following ozone treatment (D60 = 7.64 min) compared with the viability of untreated control cells (D60 = 13.84 min). The D60-values for L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 following heat and ozone exposures were not significantly different (P > 0.05). C. perfringens cells that survived ozone treatment did not exhibit increased resistance to pH (pH 6 to 12) relative to non-ozone-treated cells when grown at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The heat treatment also resulted in decreased numbers of surviving cells above and below neutral pH values for both E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes relative to those of non-heat-treated cells grown at 37 degrees C for 24 h. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in C. perfringens reductions with increasing NaCl concentrations. The effects of NaCl were less apparent for E. coli and L. monocytogenes survivors. It is concluded that pathogens surviving ozone treatment of beef are less likely to endanger food safety than are those surviving sublethal heat treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center, Microbial Food Safety Research Unit, 600 East Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania 19038, USA. jnovak@arserrc.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Novak", "ForeName": "John S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "James T C", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium perfringens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli O157"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12636289", "10.4315/0362-028x-66.3.382", "S0362-028X(22)03068-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
