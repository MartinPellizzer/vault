Ocular surface parameters (conjunctival chemosis and hyperemia, Schirmer tear test-1, tear film break-up time, fluorescein stain, conjunctival microbiology, etc) were evaluated when the AQI was reported in 1 of the 3 categories (good, moderate, and smoke) for 3 consecutive days. The AQI and air pollutant levels (particulate matter < 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter [PM2.5], ozone, etc) were retrieved from the AirNow database.", "Due to scheduling conflicts, only 7 dogs were examined during the smoke category. Average AQI in the 3 categories were good, 44.1; moderate, 73.7; and smoke, 103.7. The odds for more severe hyperemia and more severe chemosis for smoke were 5.39 and 7,853.02 times the odds, respectively, when compared to good AQI. Additionally, the odds for more severe chemosis were 34,656.62 times the odds for smoke when compared to moderate AQI. A significant relationship was found between chemosis and PM2.5.", "Exposure to increased AQI related to wildfire smoke caused a significant increase in conjunctivitis. The significant relationship between chemosis and PM2.5 could indicate that PM2.5 in wildfire smoke is associated with an inflammatory factor.", "Preventive measures (eg, use of eyewash, artificial tears, or eye protection) for dogs that are exposed to wildfire smoke should be instituted to decrease the risk of ocular irritation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Katrina E V", "Initials": "KEV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, College of Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KR Love Quantitative Consulting and Collaboration, Athens, GA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Love", "ForeName": "Kim R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daniels", "ForeName": "Joshua B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lappin", "ForeName": "Michael R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Linde Henriksen", "ForeName": "Michala", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Vet Med Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503067", "ISSNLinking": "0003-1488"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39137801", "10.2460/javma.24.05.0356"]}}]}
