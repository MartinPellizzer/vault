Over-exposure to UV radiation is harmful, but small amounts of exposure are required for good health. It is, therefore, crucial for humans to optimise their own UV exposure and not exceed UV levels that are sufficient for essential biological functions. Exceeding those levels may increase risk of developing health problems including skin cancer and cataracts. Smartphones have been previously investigated for their ability to detect UV radiation with or without additional devices that monitor personal UV exposure, in order to maintain safe exposure times by individuals. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of smartphones' use in UV radiation monitoring and prediction. There are four main methods for UV radiation detection or prediction involving the use smartphones, depending on the requirements of the user: devoted software applications developed for smartphones to predict UV Index (UVI), wearable and non-wearable devices that can be used with smartphones to provide real-time UVI, and the use of smartphone image sensors to detect UV radiation. The latter method has been a growing area of research over the last decade. Built-in smartphone image sensors have been investigated for UV radiation detection and the quantification of related atmospheric factors (including aerosols, ozone, clouds and volcanic plumes). The overall practicalities, limitations and challenges are reviewed, specifically in regard to public education. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones can provide an interactive tool when considering public education on the effects and individual monitoring of UV radiation exposure, although social and geographic areas with low socio-economic factors could challenge the usefulness of smartphones. Overall, the review shows that smartphones provide multiple opportunities in different forms to educate users on personal health with respect to UV radiation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
