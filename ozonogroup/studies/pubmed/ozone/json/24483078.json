Under elevated CO2, there existed significant differences in the shoot dry mass and DIMBOA content among the test wheat cultivars. As compared with the control (CO2 370 microL x L(-1); O3 40 microL x L(-1)), the shoot and root dry mass of cultivar Bima-1 under elevated CO2 increased by 36.8% and 24.7%, respectively, and the DIMBOA content increased by 5.7%-184.6%. Elevated O3 decreased the seedling dry mass except for Bima-1 and Shan-139, but increased the DIMBOA content of all the cultivars, with an increment of 0.5-3 folds. Under the interaction of elevated CO2 and O3, the root dry mass of all cultivars decreased, and the shoot dry mass, root dry mass, and DIMBOA content of Changwu-134 had the greatest decrement of 8.2%, 27.9%, and 35.5%, respectively. In contrast to the decrease of the DIMBOA content of Changwu-134, Yuanfeng-175 and Lankao-217, the DIMBOA content of Shan-139 increased by 84.6%. The cluster analysis indicated that both the treatments and the cultivars had significant effects on the DIMBOA content, the cultivars Shan-139, Lankao-217, and Changwu-134 under the elevated CO2 or O3 could be grouped together, whereas the DIMBOA content of Shan-139 in all treatments increased. These findings suggested that DIMBOA could be used as a specific indicator for resistance breeding under climate change, especially under elevated O3 and CO2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110164, China. ying3858@126.com"}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ying", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110164, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110164, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoxazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pheromones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TI783RU0DR", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoxazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pheromones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24483078"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
