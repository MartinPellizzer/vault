This study investigated the influence of a quaternary antibiotic mixture on Microcystis aeruginosa after UV-B radiation through a 15-day exposure test. UV-B radiation extended the lag phase of M. aeruginosa at doses of 600 and 900\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, and significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced the growth rate and the F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> value at doses of 300-900\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Although UV-B radiation significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) stimulated the microcystin production ability in each cyanobacterial cell, the total microcystin concentration still significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decreased due to the reduction of cell density. Mixed antibiotics and UV-B regulated the proteomic expression profile of M. aeruginosa in different manners. UV-B radiation upregulated 19 proteins and downregulated 49 proteins in M. aeruginosa, while mixed antibiotics upregulated 45 proteins and downregulated 25 proteins in UV-B treated cells. Mixed antibiotics significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) stimulated growth and photosynthesis, increased cell density and microcystin concentration, and reduced oxidative stress in UV-B treated cells through the upregulation of proteins involved in photosynthesis, biosynthesis, cell division, oxidation-reduction, gene expression and microcystin synthesis. This study verified the hypothesis that antibiotics accelerated the recovery of M. aeruginosa from UV-B induced damage. A safe threshold of 20\u00a0ng/L was suggested for mixed antibiotics (5\u00a0ng/L for each antibiotic), in order to eliminate the stimulatory effects of antibiotics on bloom-forming cyanobacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
