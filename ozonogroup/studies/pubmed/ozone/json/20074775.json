Before ozonation, ciprofloxacin sorption on suspended solids was tested as a function of temperature (10.0-27.5 degrees C) and pH (3, 7 and 10). Temperature did not significantly affect ciprofloxacin sorption while sorption was highest at pH 7 (logK(d)=4.7) compared to pH 3 (logK(d)=4.3) and 10 (logK(d)=3.9) (n=3). Ozonation was slowest at pH 7 with ciprofloxacin half life times of 29 min, compared to 19 and 27 min at pH 10 and 3, respectively. Addition of 10-1000 microM H(2)O(2) increased ciprofloxacin half life times up to 38 min, probably influenced by competition with H(2)O(2) for ozone as well as radical species. Ciprofloxacin ozonation products were identical as previously detected during ciprofloxacin ozonation in deionized water and revealed strong pH dependence. Residual antibacterial activity was measured by agar diffusion tests. For Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli, reduction of antibacterial activity was related to the parent compound degradation, while degradation products indicated to be the main compounds with respect to the antibacterial activity against Bacillus coagulans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
