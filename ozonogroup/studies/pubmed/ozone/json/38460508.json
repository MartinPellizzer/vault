Due to the poor results of commonly used treatments for OP, there is a need for investigation of more effective treatments, such as ozone therapy. Ozone therapy is used to treat a variety of diseases, including musculoskeletal conditions.", "A 30-year-old amateur soccer player diagnosed with OP received conservative treatment with traditional physiotherapy and analgesic medications.
