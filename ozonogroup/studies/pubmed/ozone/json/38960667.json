The zirconia specimens were divided into eight groups based on the surface treatment method: alumina blasting, air plasma, argon plasma (AP), Katana cleaner, ozonated water, ozonated water+AP, Katana cleaner+AP, and tap water+AP. The contact angles, SBS, and fracture modes were tested. AP treatment significantly reduced the contact angle (p<0.0001). The combination of AP and other cleaning methods showed a higher bond strength and more mixed fractures. Our findings indicate that using atmospheric pressure plasma with argon gas, combined with other cleaning methods, results in a stronger bond than when using alumina blasting alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Fixed Prosthodontics, Department of Restorative and Biomaterials Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science and Turku Clinical Biomaterials Center-TCBC, Institute of Dentistry, University of Turku."}], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "Shoko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Fixed Prosthodontics, Department of Restorative and Biomaterials Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry."}], "LastName": "Fujisawa", "ForeName": "Masanori", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science and Turku Clinical Biomaterials Center-TCBC, Institute of Dentistry, University of Turku."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and Biomaterials Science, Institute of Dentistry, University of Turku."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Welfare District of County of Southwest Finland."}], "LastName": "Vallittu", "ForeName": "Pekka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomaterials Science and Turku Clinical Biomaterials Center-TCBC, Institute of Dentistry, University of Turku."}], "LastName": "Lassila", "ForeName": "Lippo", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Dent Mater J", "NlmUniqueID": "8309299", "ISSNLinking": "0287-4547"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "C6V6S92N3C", "NameOfSubstance": "Zirconium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resin Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S38N85C5G0", "NameOfSubstance": "zirconium oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67XQY1V3KH", "NameOfSubstance": "Argon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zirconium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resin Cements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Shear Strength"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Argon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Stress Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38960667", "10.4012/dmj.2024-051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
