Rheological measurements showed that DEW gels with dry-heat treatments have a higher dynamic complex modulus than DEW gels without dry-heat treatments. Furthermore, ultrasonic attenuation analyses showed that subjecting DEWs to dry-heat treatment and alkaline pH induced the formation of an increased number of DEW protein \"soluble aggregates\" compared with unheated and neutral DEWs. Our data suggests that pretreatment of DEW samples led to partially unfolded DEW proteins with more \"soluble aggregates\", which were strongly correlated with the formation of gels with a more homogeneous and rigid texture. Understanding their structural properties at a molecular detail would enable desirable textural modifications for the development of new food products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
