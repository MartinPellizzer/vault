In the reactions of low levels of ozone, a carbon-centered radical was spin-trapped with DMPO, giving rise to the 6-line ESR signal in both whole blood and blood plasma. In the blood plasma, DMPO-spin adduct of hydroxyl radical (DMPO-OH) was detected together with the spin adduct of carbon-centered radical. The present spin-trapping study demonstrates that, when exposed to ozone, 0.9% NaCl solution in the presence of DMPO gives rise to the formation of DMPO-OH. The addition effects of ethanol, which is a .OH scavenger, into the NaCl solution reveal that DMPO-OH is produced by the reaction of DMPO with both .OH and unidentified oxidants originated from the reaction of Cl- and ozone. Based on these observations, we consider that .OH is generated similarly in the blood plasma exposed to ozone. The ESR study of DMPO-spin adducts in the ozone-exposed aqueous solution of NaOCl indicates that Cl- reacts with ozone to give ClO-. Presumably, further oxidation of ClO- by ozone leads to the formations of .OH and the unidentified oxidants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Saitama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ueno", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoshino", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shinriki", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic N-Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spin Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7170JZ1QF3", "NameOfSubstance": "5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic N-Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spin Labels"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9790514", "10.1080/10715769800300141"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
