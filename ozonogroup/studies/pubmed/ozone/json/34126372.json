Exposure assessment relied on satellite-based model of exposure to particulate matter of size <2.5 and 10 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) and temperature at a spatial resolution of 1 km (Kloog\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015). The information on exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels was completed from the database of the monitoring stations. We analyzed the data using a semi-ecological approach. The monthly incidence of MS-related relapses requiring hospitalization as a function of environmental factors was analyzed by time-series technique, adjusting to sex, age and smoking. We also used a case-crossover approach to compare environmental exposure of a patient on the day of the relapse with the exposure on the relapse-free days. All estimates were adjusted to the heat index and were divided by IQR.", "There were 287 MS patients in the study, with an average age of 52.8 \u00b1 16.7 years, 37% of them (107) being under 40. Mostly female (66.2%), and 13.6% of the patients smoking (47% non-smoking and 39.4% unknown). PM<sub>2.5</sub> was independently associated with MS relapses within the non-smoking population [Relative Risk (RR)=1.28, 95%CI:1.01-1.62]. O<sub>3</sub> was found adversely associated with MS relapses among patients younger than 40 [RR=1.58, 95%CI 1.03-4.43]. Based on the case-crossover approach, relapses were associated with elevated levels of PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in all subjects [Odds Ratio (OR)=1.05, 95%CI:1.00-1.11; OR=1.85, 95%CI: 1.28-2.68, respectively].
