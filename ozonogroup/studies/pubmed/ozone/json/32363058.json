Despite the increased prevalence of NTM-related infections, it is largely underreported from TB-endemic countries due to lack of awareness and limited laboratory facilities. Here, we report a rare case of L4-L5 spondylodiscitis caused by MA following ozone therapy (a noncondoned method of lumbar disc management).", "A healthy, nonimmunocompromised 43-year-old female presented with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. She underwent a fluoroscopically guided percutaneous ozone treatment for degenerated disc disease at the L4-L5 level. She was symptom free for 3 months duration. She then presented with severe low back pain, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and spondylodiscitis at the L4-L5 level. This was treated with a L4-L5 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. MA was cultured from the epidural purulent material collected during the surgery. The patient was discharged on oral clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and intravenous amikacin 500 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. The plan was to then continue oral clarithromycin for another 6 weeks till resolution of primary infection.", "Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy is required to treat NTM which is more prevalent in epidemic/endemic regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Surgical Neurology International."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Shahi", "ForeName": "Prem Bahadur", "Initials": "PB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Panigrahi", "ForeName": "Vishnuprasad", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Adsul", "ForeName": "Nitin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Manoj", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Acharya", "ForeName": "Shankar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Kalra", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ortho-Spine Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Chahal", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Surg Neurol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "101535836", "ISSNLinking": "2152-7806"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Andr\u00e9s-Cano P, Vela T, Cano C, Garc\u00eda G, Vera JC, Andr\u00e9s-Garc\u00eda JA.
