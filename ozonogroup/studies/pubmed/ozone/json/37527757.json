The emission-based chemical transport models (CTM) are broadly used to predict O<sub>3</sub> formation, but they may deviate from observations due to input uncertainties such as emissions and meteorological data, in addition to the treatment of O<sub>3</sub> nonlinear chemistry. In this study, an innovative recurrent spatiotemporal deep-learning (RSDL) method with model-monitor coupled convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) has been developed to improve O<sub>3</sub> predictions of CTM. The RSDL method was first used to build the ConvRNN within a 24-h scale to characterize the spatiotemporal relationships between the monitored O<sub>3</sub> data and CTM simulations, and then incorporated the recurrent pattern to achieve 72-h multi-site forecasts based on a pilot study over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The results showed that the RSDL method predicted O<sub>3</sub> with high accuracy over this case study, with an increase of 27.54% in the correlation coefficient (R) average for all sites as well as an increase in R of 0.14-0.21 for all cities compared to CTM. Moreover, the regional distribution of CTM was further improved by the RSDL predictions with the data fusion technique, which greatly reduced the underpredictions of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, particularly in high O<sub>3</sub>-level areas (concentrations >160\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), with a 33.55% reduction in the mean absolute error (MAE)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
