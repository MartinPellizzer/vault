Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) are major coagulation biomarkers. However, there has been no systematic meta-analysis to summarize associations of ambient air pollution with these coagulation biomarkers. To assess the overall associations between ambient particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and major coagulation biomarkers including PAI-1, vWF, sP-selectin and t-PA based on the existing epidemiological research. We performed a systematic literature search of publications reporting the associations of ambient air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2,</sub> and CO) with coagulation biomarkers (PAI-1, vWF, sP-selectin and t-PA) in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus databases as of April 5, 2022. Then, we performed a random-effect meta-analysis, which included 27 articles, and then identified the potential sources of heterogeneity. The pooled percent changes of coagulation biomarkers per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in short-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 2.43% (95% CI: 0.59%, 4.29%) in PAI-1, 1.08% (95% CI: 0.21%, 1.96%) in vWF and 1.14% (95% CI: 0.59%, 1.68%) in sP-selectin, respectively. We also found significant associations of short-term exposure to ambient O<sub>3</sub> with PAI-1 (1.62%, 95% CI: 0.01%, 3.25%), sP-selectin (9.59%, 95% CI:2.78%, 16.86%) and t-PA (0.45%, 95% CI: 0.02%, 0.88%), respectively. Short-term exposures to ambient PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO were not significantly associated with changes in coagulation biomarkers. In conclusion, short-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> are associated with significant increases in coagulation biomarkers, suggesting an activated coagulation state upon air pollution exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
