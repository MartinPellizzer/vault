Some of these species also occur in biophysiological systems. Five analytes were investigated in this study: oxoethanoate (glyoxylate), 2-oxopropanoate (pyruvate), 2-oxobutanoate (2-ketobutyrate), 2-oxopentanoate (2-ketovalerate) and oxopropanedioate (ketomalonate, mesoxalate). Ion chromatography (IC) and gas chromatography (GC) were evaluated for the quantitation of these analytes at concentrations < or =200 ng ml(-1). For the IC method, the samples are run directly with minimal to no pre-treatment. For the GC method, the analytes must be derivatized with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)oxylamine to form oximes. The oximes are extracted into tert-butyl methyl ether and the carboxylic acid is esterified (methylated) with diazomethane. It was concluded that the ion chromatographic determination is significantly superior to the gas chromatographic method for these analytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Water Supply and Water Resources Division, Treatment Technology Evaluation Branch, Cincinnati, OH 452"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urbansky", "ForeName": "E T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bashe", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oximes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Esterification"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oximes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10670716", "10.1016/s0021-9673(99)01158-9", "S0021-9673(99)01158-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
