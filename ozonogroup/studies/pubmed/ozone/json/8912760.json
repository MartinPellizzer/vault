The present study was designed to test whether biomarkers of inflammation are detectable in humans exposed to ozone and associated copollutants under natural conditions outdoors. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was carried out on 19 normal volunteer joggers from Governors Island, NY, who exercised in the afternoon during the 1992 summer (S1) season. Fifteen subjects were retested during the following, low ozone, winter season (W). The BAL protocol involved an initial instillation of 20 ml saline followed by four sequential 50-ml saline washes carried out in both the right middle lobe and the lingula. The eight 50-ml samples were pooled as the 'alveolar' sample. Analyses performed on the alveolar lavage samples included cell differentials, release of IL-8, TNF-alpha, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by pooled cells, and levels of IL-8, protein, LDH, fibronectin, alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT), complement fragment 3a (C3a), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lavage fluids. Release of ROS by stimulated BAL cells was lower in S1 than in W (p = 0.03). In contrast, LDH levels in BAL fluids were 2-fold higher in S1 than in W (p = 0.02), as were IL-8 (p = 0.12) and PGE2 (p = 0.06). These results suggest a possible ongoing inflammatory response in the lungs of recreational joggers exposed to ozone and associated copollutants during the summer months."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinney", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nilsen", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lippmann", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brescia", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McGovern", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El-Fawal", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devlin", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rom", "ForeName": "W N", "Initials": "WN"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-0256", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-48619", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "M01 RR-00096", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jogging"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8912760", "10.1164/ajrccm.154.5.8912760"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
