We focused on the C-terminal region that could form a hydrophobic core in the aggregation process and identified a toxic conformer-restricted dimer model (E22P,G38DAP-A\u03b240 dimer) with an l,l-2,6-diaminopimelic acid linker (<i>n</i> = 3) at position 38, which exhibited moderate cytotoxicity. We synthesized four additional linkers (<i>n</i> = 2, 4, 5, 7) to determine the most appropriate distance between the two A\u03b240 monomers for a toxic dimer model. Each di-Fmoc-protected two-valent amino acid was synthesized from a corresponding dialdehyde or cycloalkene followed by ozonolysis, using a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction and asymmetric hydrogenation. Then, the corresponding A\u03b240 dimer models with these linkers at position 38 were synthesized using the solid-phase Fmoc strategy. Their cytotoxicity toward SH-SY5Y cells suggested that the shorter the linker length, the stronger the cytotoxicity. Particularly, the E22P,G38DAA-A\u03b240 dimer (<i>n</i> = 2) formed protofibrillar aggregates and exhibited the highest cytotoxicity, equivalent to E22P-A\u03b242, the most cytotoxic analogue of A\u03b242. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) measurement indicated that all dimer models except the E22P,G38DAA-A\u03b240 dimer existed as stable oligomers (12-24-mer). NativePAGE analysis supported the IM-MS data, but larger oligomers (30-150-mer) were also detected after a 24 h incubation. Moreover, E22P,G38DAA-A\u03b240, E22P,G38DAP-A\u03b240, and E22P,G38DAZ-A\u03b240 (<i>n</i> = 5) dimers suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Overall, the ability to form fibrils with cross \u03b2-sheet structures was key to achieving cytotoxicity, and forming stable oligomers less than 150-mer did not correlate with cytotoxicity and LTP suppression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto606-8502, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chikugo", "ForeName": "Ayaka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto606-8502, Japan."}], "LastName": "Irie", "ForeName": "Yumi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9361-0857"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto606-8502, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tsukano", "ForeName": "Chihiro", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto606-8502, Japan."}], "LastName": "Uchino", "ForeName": "Ayumi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama930-0194, Japan."}], "LastName": "Maki", "ForeName": "Takahito", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama930-0194, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kume", "ForeName": "Toshiaki", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nihon Waters K.K., Tokyo140-0001, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kawase", "ForeName": "Taiji", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nihon Waters K.K., Tokyo140-0001, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hirose", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Neuroscience Research Center, Shiga University of Medical Sciences, Shiga520-2192, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kageyama", "ForeName": "Yusuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8054-9666"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Neuroscience Research Center, Shiga University of Medical Sciences, Shiga520-2192, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tooyama", "ForeName": "Ikuo", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7109-8568"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto606-8502, Japan."}], "LastName": "Irie", "ForeName": "Kazuhiro", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Chem Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "101525337", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cycloparaffins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "583-93-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Diaminopimelic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cycloparaffins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diaminopimelic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neuroblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36095282", "10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00436"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
