Research has shown that phytoplankton photosynthesis can be severely inhibited by surface irradiance and that much of the effect is due to UV radiation. Quantitative generalization of these results requires a biological weighting function (BWF) to quantify UV exposure appropriately. Different methods have been employed to infer the general shape of the BWF for photoinhibition in natural phytoplankton, and recently, detailed BWFs have been determined for phytoplankton cultures and natural samples. Results show that although UVB photons are more damaging than UVA (320-400 nm), the greater fluxes of UVA in the ocean cause more UV inhibition. Models can be used to analyze the sensitivity of water column productivity to UVB and ozone depletion. Assumptions about linearity and time-dependence strongly influence the extrapolation of results. Laboratory measurements suggest that UV inhibition can reach a steady-state consistent with a balance between damage and recovery processes, leading to a non-linear relationship between weighted fluence rate and inhibition. More testing for natural phytoplankton is required, however. The relationship between photoinhibition of photosynthesis and decreases in growth rate is poorly understood, so long-term effects of ozone depletion are hard to predict. However, the wide variety of sensitivities between species suggests that some changes in species composition are likely. Predicted effects of ozone depletion on marine photosynthesis cannot be equated to changes in carbon flux between the atmosphere and ocean. Nonetheless, properly designed studies on the effects of UVB can help identify which physiological and ecological processes are most likely to dominate the responses of marine ecosystems to ozone depletion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oceanography, Dalhousie University, B3H 4J1, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cullen", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neale", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Photosynth Res", "NlmUniqueID": "100954728", "ISSNLinking": "0166-8595"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1992 Oct 23;258(5082):646-50", "ArticleIdList": ["17748901"]}, {"Citation": "J Plant Physiol. 1985 Apr;118(5):391-400", "ArticleIdList": ["23196172"]}, {"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1992 Jun;55(6):867-72", "ArticleIdList": ["1409892"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1994 Mar;39(3):475-89", "ArticleIdList": ["24311138"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1985 Dec;79(4):992-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16664559"]}, {"Citation": "J Cell Comp Physiol. 1951 Oct;38(2):217-43", "ArticleIdList": ["14897862"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1966 Jun;41(6):1037-43", "ArticleIdList": ["16656345"]}, {"Citation": "Curr Microbiol. 1990 Sep;21(3):161-8", "ArticleIdList": ["11540623"]}, {"Citation": "J Photochem Photobiol B. 1992 Apr 30;13(2):187-90", "ArticleIdList": ["1506990"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Sep;86(17):6617-20", "ArticleIdList": ["2671998"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Jul;68(1):74-81", "ArticleIdList": ["16661893"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1990 Nov 2;250(4981):661-4", "ArticleIdList": ["17810867"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993 Jan;59(1):170-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16348840"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1992 Feb 21;255(5047):952-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1546292"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1974 Sep;71(9):3363-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4530308"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1993 Apr;36(1):17-23", "ArticleIdList": ["24318794"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24311127", "10.1007/BF00014589"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
