The ozone production and its sensitivity were characterized with the measured O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors. The results showed that the daily variation in total peroxy radical concentrations exhibited an obvious convex tend, with the highest value at approximately 12:00; the average peak peroxy radical concentration was 43.8\u00d710<sup>-12</sup>; and the concentrations of the peroxy radical and ozone were driven by strong solar radiation and high temperature. The photochemical ozone production rate could be determined with peroxy radical and NO concentration. The average ozone peak production rate in summer was 10.6\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, which was more sensitive to NO concentration. Based on the ratio of the radical loss rate due to reactions with NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> to the radical loss rate (Ln/<i>Q</i>), the characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> production in the western suburb of Hefei in summer were analyzed. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> production sensitivity varied greatly during the day. The summer O<sub>3</sub> production regime shifted from the VOC-sensitive chemistry in the early morning to NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-sensitive chemistry in the afternoon, and this regime transition typically occurred in the morning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Heifei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Island Branch, Graduate School, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Heifei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Na-Na", "Initials": "NN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Heifei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xue-Zhe", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Island Branch, Graduate School, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Optoelectronics Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Heifei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Island Branch, Graduate School, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Yi-Chen", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Heifei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wei-Xiong", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Heifei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Optoelectronics Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Jun", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37040948", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202206116"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
