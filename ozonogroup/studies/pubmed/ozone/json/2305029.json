As shown by the angular distribution the fluorescence light is diffusely emitted. However, the scattered light consists of a diffuse and a reflecting portion below 20 degrees with a ratio of the intensities of 1 : 2 at perpendicular observation (0 degrees). Control measurements show that in the rejection region the effective transmission of cut-off-filters commonly used to separate fluorescence light and excitation light exceeds the value calculated from the filter specifications by a factor of 100. Therefore, the portion of the scattered light in the measuring signal must be controlled if the fluorescence induction kinetics is measured from specimen of different colour. A device for the determination of the fluorescence induction kinetics is described which employs a He--Ne laser, a mechanically working shutter with an opening time of 4 ms for the excitation, and a computer for data storage and device control. Two filters select the fluorescence components at 685 nm and 730 nm and they reduce the portion of the scattered light in the measuring signal to 0.18% and 0.55%, respectively. In order to consider the temporal development of the fluorescence kinetics the sampling rate is reduced from 2 kHz to 1 Hz. From the data stored in the computer maximum value Fp, and steady-state-value Fs are determined for both fluorescence components. Measurements on 4-year-old spruce exposed to ozone-concentrations of 0, 300 ppb, 600 ppb, and 1000 ppb were repeated every week. With increasing concentration and duration of treatment Rfd = (Fp-Fs)/Fs was decreased for both fluorescence components. With the highest ozone concentration a reduction of Rfd of 23% and 24%, respectively, was obtained for the two fluorescence components after three weeks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MEDIS-Institut, Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Strahlen- und Umweltforschung mbH M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Federal Republic of Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruth", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Radiat Environ Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0415677", "ISSNLinking": "0301-634X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scattering, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Biochem Z. 1960;332:277-92", "ArticleIdList": ["14404931"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1984 Jun;5(2):139-57", "ArticleIdList": ["24458602"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1977 Jan;136(3):233-8", "ArticleIdList": ["24420396"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1987 Jan;11(2):173-82", "ArticleIdList": ["24435493"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1981 Jun;2(2):115-41", "ArticleIdList": ["24470202"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1978 Jan;61(1):80-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16660243"]}, {"Citation": "Radiat Environ Biophys. 1986;25(4):297-308", "ArticleIdList": ["3823375"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 May 13;635(3):542-51", "ArticleIdList": ["7236677"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1983 Jan;4(1):361-73", "ArticleIdList": ["24458416"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2305029", "10.1007/BF01211235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
