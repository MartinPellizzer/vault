Epidemiological associations have been made between the onset of asthma and childhood exposures to increasing levels of ambient ozone (i.e., air pollutant-induced nonatopic asthma). Individuals, however, vary in their susceptibility to this outdoor air pollutant, which may be due, in part, to their genetic makeup. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there are murine strain-dependent differences in pulmonary and nasal pathologic responses to repeated ozone exposures. C57BL/6NTac and BALB/cNTac mice were exposed to 0 or 0.8 ppm ozone, 4 hr/day, for 9 consecutive weekdays. In both strains of mice, ozone induced eosinophilic inflammation and mucous cell metaplasia in the nasal and pulmonary airways. Lungs of ozone-exposed C57BL/6NTac mice, however, had greater eosinophilic inflammation, mucous cell metaplasia, and expression of genes related to type 2 immunity and airway mucus hypersecretion, as compared to similarly exposed BALB/cNTac mice. Ozone-exposed C57BL/6NTac mice also had greater eosinophilic rhinitis but a similar degree of mucous cell metaplasia in nasal epithelium, as ozone-exposed BALB/cNTac mice. These findings suggest that nonatopic individuals may differ in their inflammatory and epithelial responses to repeated ozone exposures that are due, in part, to genetic factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Harkema", "ForeName": "Jack R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Hotchkiss", "ForeName": "Lucas A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Vetter", "ForeName": "Nicholas A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Jackson-Humbles", "ForeName": "Daven N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Lewandowski", "ForeName": "Ryan P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "James G", "Initials": "JG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "T35 OD016477", "Acronym": "OD", "Agency": "NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "7905907", "ISSNLinking": "0192-6233"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Mucosal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metaplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28068894", "10.1177/0192623316674274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
