In this work, a novel approach combining activated carbon adsorption, oxygen plasma treatment and ozonation was studied for the removal of the persistent chlorinated pesticide alachlor. A comparison was made between the removal efficiency and energy consumption for two different reactor operation modes: batch-recirculation and single-pass mode. The kinetics study revealed that the insufficient removal of alachlor by adsorption was significantly improved in terms of degradation efficiency and energy consumption when combined with the plasma treatment. The best efficiency (ca. 80% removal with an energy cost of 19.4\u202fkWh m<sup>-</sup>\u00b3) was found for the single-pass operational mode of the reactor. In the batch-recirculating process, a complete elimination of alachlor by plasma treatment was observed after 30\u202fmin of treatment. Analysis of the reactive species induced by plasma in aqueous solutions showed that the decomposition of alachlor mainly occurred through a radical oxidation mechanism, with a minor contribution of long-living oxidants (O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Investigation of the alachlor oxidation pathways revealed six different oxidation mechanisms, including the loss of aromaticity which was never before reported for plasma-assisted degradation of aromatic pesticides. It was revealed that the removal rate and energy cost could be further improved with more than 50% by additional O<sub>3</sub> gas bubbling in the solution reservoir."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
