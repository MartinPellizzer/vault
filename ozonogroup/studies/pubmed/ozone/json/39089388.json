However, limited research explores their combined effect on oxidative stress.", "A total of 251 participants with multi-time measurements were included in the longitudinal-designed study. Personal gaseous air pollutants (CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>,) and particulate pollution (PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>) were measured and followed in two 7-day windows while ambient exposure levels and urine samples were collected simultaneously. Participants' Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was estimated and used to represent greenness exposure. Urinary oxidative stress biomarkers include free malondialdehyde (MDA), total MDA, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Linear mixed-effects models were used to independently and jointly estimate the associations of greenness and air pollution with oxidative stress biomarkers.", "We found consistent positive associations of personal ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure with 8-OHdG percent changes, and this association was modified by gender and outdoor activity frequency. Consistent positive associations of personal lag 2-day carbon monoxide (CO) exposure with the percent changes of the three oxidative stress biomarkers were significant. We additionally observed that individuals who lived in greener areas had lower levels of urinary-free and total MDA. Participants in the highest NDVI tertile had 0.38 and 0.46 lower free and total MDA levels, [95\u202f% CI: (-0.70, -0.05) and (-0.78, -0.13)], compared to the lowest NDVI tertile. There was also evidence indicating the modification effects by area, education, and outdoor activity frequency on associations between NDVI exposure and creatinine adjusted free MDA (all P<sub>for interaction</sub>\u202f<\u202f0.05). Additional greenness modification effects on personal O<sub>3</sub> exposure with urinary 8-OHdG was observed.", "Our study provides biological evidence of the modification effect of the built environment on the impact of air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
