In this study, we fit a four-component EEM-PARAFAC model to characterize DOM extracted from poultry litter. The data set included fluorescence EEMs from 291 untreated, irradiated (253.7 nm, 310-410 nm), and oxidized (UV-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ozone) poultry litter extracts. The four components were identified as microbial humic-, terrestrial humic-, tyrosine-, and tryptophan-like fluorescent signatures. The Tucker's congruence coefficients for components from the global (i.e., aggregated sample set) model and local (i.e., single poultry litter source) models were greater than 0.99, suggesting that the global EEM-PARAFAC model may be suitable to study poultry litter DOM from individual sources. In general, the transformation trends of the four fluorescence components were comparable for all poultry litter sources tested. For irradiation at 253.7 nm, ozonation, and UV-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> advanced oxidation, transformation of the humic-like components was slower than that of the tryptophan-like component. The opposite trend was observed for irradiation at 310-410 nm, due to differences in UV absorbance properties of components. Compared to the other EEM-PARAFAC components, the tyrosine-like component was fairly recalcitrant in irradiation and oxidation processes. This novel application of EEM-PARAFAC modeling provides insight into the composition and fate of agricultural DOM in natural and engineered systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Baltimore County Department of Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering 1000 Hilltop Circle, ECS 314 Baltimore, Maryland 21250 United States."}], "LastName": "Mangalgiri", "ForeName": "Kiranmayi P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kennedy/Jenks Consultants 1191 Second Avenue, Suite 630 Seattle, Washington 98101, United States."}], "LastName": "Timko", "ForeName": "Stephen A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Chesapeake Biological Laboratory 146 Williams Street, P.O.
