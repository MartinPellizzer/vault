However, ozone bleaching, one of the most effective oxidants known, stimulates blood circulation and immune response and thus it has strong antimicrobial activity against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. For these reasons, one of our hypothesis was ozone bleaching would reduce local and systemic DNA damage in the body. Hence, we aimed to determine the oxidative DNA damage biomarker levels in serum, saliva, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by measuring 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) after different bleaching methods.Forty-eight volunteers who requested dental bleaching were divided into three treatment groups (<i>n</i> = 16). Group 1: ozone bleaching with the ozone-releasing machine; Group 2: chemical bleaching with 40% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) gel; Group 3: 40% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gel activated with the diode laser. Initial and post-operative (immediately after bleaching and two weeks later) color measurements were performed with a spectrophotometer. The color changes were calculated with the CIEDE2000 (\u0394<i>E</i> <sub>00</sub>) formula. 8-OHdG levels in serum, saliva, and GCF samples were determined with ELISA. All three treatments resulted in efficient and statistically similar bleaching. The 8-OHdG levels in the serum and saliva were not affected by all bleaching methods (<i>p</i> > 0.05), but a temporary increase was observed in the GCF for chemical and laser-assisted groups except the ozone group (<i>p</i> > 0.05). According to the findings, chemical and laser-assisted bleaching can affect DNA damage locally but not systemically. Bleaching with ozone may eliminate this local DNA damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6034-3131"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dentistry Faculty, Department of Restorative Dentistry, 37512Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "S\u00fcrmelio\u011flu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dentistry Faculty, Department of Periodontology, 37512Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcndo\u011far", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biochemistry, 37512Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Taysi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dentistry Faculty, Department of Restorative Dentistry, 37504Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ba\u011fi\u015f", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "88847-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Crevicular Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Bleaching Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33622079", "10.1177/0960327121996030"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
