We sought to evaluate the time-varying effects of prenatal air pollutant exposure on ASD. We conducted a matched case-control study of singleton term children born in Ontario, Canada from 1-Apr-2012 to 31-Dec-2016. Provincial birth registry data were linked with applied behavioural analysis services and ambient air pollutant datasets to ascertain prenatal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and ASD diagnoses. Covariate balance between cases and controls was established using coarsened exact matching. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between prenatal air pollutant exposure and ASD. Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were used to examine the effects of single-pollutant exposure by prenatal week. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of exposure period on the observed findings. The final sample included 1589 ASD cases and 7563 controls. Compared to controls, cases were more likely to be born to mothers living in urban areas, delivered by Caesarean section, and assigned male sex at birth. NO<sub>2</sub> was a consistent and significant contributor to ASD risk after accounting for co-exposure to O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and covariates. The odds ratio per interquartile range increase was 2.1 (95%CI 1.8-2.3) pre-conception, 2.2 (2.0-2.5) for the 1st trimester, 2.2 (1.9-2.5) for the 2nd trimester, and 2.1 (1.9-2.4) for the 3rd trimester. In contrast, findings for O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> with ASD were inconsistent. Findings from DLNM and sensitivity analyses were similar. Exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> before and during pregnancy was significantly associated with ASD in offspring. The relationship between prenatal O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and ASD remains unclear. Further investigation into the combined effects of multi-pollutant exposure on child neurodevelopment is warranted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2024. Published by Elsevier Inc.
