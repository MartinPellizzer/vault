First, global 3-D tropospheric chemistry and transport model (GEOS-Chem)-integrated satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and vertical profiles were used to estimate near-surface sulfate and nitrate levels at 10-km resolution over China from 2006 to 2014. Ground measurement validation of our satellite model yielded correlation coefficients (r) of 0.7 and 0.73 and normalized mean bias (NMB) values of -37.96% and\u202f-\u202f32.73% for sulfate and nitrate, respectively. Second, analyses of the spatiotemporal distributions of sulfate and nitrate as well as the vertical density Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-measured SO<sub>2</sub> (PBL_SO<sub>2</sub>) and NO<sub>2</sub> (TVCD_NO<sub>2</sub>) indicated that the highest nitrate and sulfate levels occurred in the North China Plain (~25\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and Sichuan Basin (SCB) (~30\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), respectively. The long-term variations in the estimated components and precursor gases indicated that the large sulfate decline was positively correlated with the SO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction due to the mandatory desulfurization implemented in 2007. The annual growth rate of sulfate relative to the national mean was -6.19%/yr, and the concentration decreased by 17.10% from 2011 to 2014. Energy consumption increases and a lack of control measures for NO<sub>2</sub> resulted in persistent increases in NO<sub>2</sub> emissions and nitrate concentrations from 2006 to 2010, particularly in the SCB. With energy consumption structure advancements, reductions in NO<sub>2</sub> emissions and corresponding nitrate levels over three typical regions were prominent after 2012. Third, the estimated national-scale uncertainties of satellite datasets at 0.1\u00b0\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.1\u00b0 were 26.88% for sulfate and 25.55% for nitrate. Differences in the spatial distributions and temporal trends between our estimated components and precursor gases were mainly attributed to the dataset accuracy, the data pre-processing strategy, inconsistent column density and near-surface mass concentration, meteorological variables and complex chemical reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
