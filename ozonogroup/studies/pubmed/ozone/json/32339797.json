In this study, 53 VOC species near nine roads in Hanoi were monitored by sampling and analyzed by GC-FID four times per day on weekdays and in the morning on the weekend, from December 2014 to January 2015. In parallel with VOC sampling, vehicle number was counted, and meteorological conditions were recorded. A large share of motorbikes was found, accounted for 82% of overall for all period, and 88% in rush hours. The average TVOC concentration was 305.1\u00a0ppb; while those of BTEX were 12.8/27.4/4.8/15.9/6.0\u00a0ppb for benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/m,p-xylenes/o-xylene, respectively. Isopentane was the most abundant species of VOCs. A significant carcinogenic risk of benzene species was found. Ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs was of 1752.7\u00a0ppb. Levels of VOC species reflected well the transportation volume. Strong correlations between motorbike number related parameters and ethylbenzene were found. High correlations were also found among ethylbenzene and almost all other VOC species. It implied that the majority of VOCs near road emitted from the same source, which is motorbikes. The calculation using emission factors from COPERT 5 model with conditions of fleets in Hanoi showed that VOCs from motorbikes contributed to more than 90% of the VOC level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
