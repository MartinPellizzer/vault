In this approach a number of pollutants are considered, and emission reductions are determined after looking at the effect of each of these pollutants on a number of environmental problems. This new approach is very ambitious and raises a number of problems in balancing the effects and costs of different emission reductions against achieved environmental benefits. We describe an iterative method designed for addressing such multi-pollutant multi-effect type problems. In the examples given here, the method is used to estimate combinations of NOx and VOC emission reductions from all European countries so as to reduce environmental problems associated with acidification and ozone in a cost-effective manner. The iterative technique is designed to be flexible and transparent, so that a number of different approaches to multi-pollutant-multi-effect problems can be considered. This technique can be used to provide early guidance on various control strategy options, and allows rapid exploration of the many targets and measures possible with these approaches. It also demonstrates how even complex multi-dimensional environmental problems may be amenable to understandable solutions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Norwegian Meteorological Institute, Oslo, Norway. david.simpson@ivl.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simpson", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eliassen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Rain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Rain"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "European Union"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Nations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10507147", "10.1016/s0048-9697(99)00256-9", "S0048-9697(99)00256-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
