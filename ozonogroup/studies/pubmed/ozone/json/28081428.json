The primary goal of the SHEMS was to produce a systemized emission inventory for air pollutants including ozone precursors for modeling air quality in urban areas. The SHEMS is principally composed of three parts: (1) a pre-processor to process emission factors, activity levels, and spatial and temporal information using a geographical information system; (2) an emission model for each source type; and (3) a post-processor to produce report and input data for air quality models through database modeling. The source categories in SHEMS are point, area, mobile, natural, and other sources such as fugitive emissions. The emission database produced by SHEMS contains 22 inventoried compounds: sulfur dioxide, NO<sub>2</sub>, carbon monoxide, and 19 speciated volatile organic compounds. To validate SHEMS, the emission data were tested with the Urban Airshed Model to predict NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the SMA during selected episode days in 1994. The results turned out to be reliable in describing temporal variation and spatial distribution of those pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Seoul National University , Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong Young", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Seoul National University , Seoul , Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jung Wk", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28081428", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464014"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
