In this work, we investigated the VOCs emission characteristics and concentrations of individual contaminants generated by the packaging and printing industries, with regard to various categories, processes, and geographic regions. VOCs emissions, ozone formation potential (OFP), and associated health risks were assessed at 10 representative packaging and printing firms across several cities in Shandong Province, China. Plastic packaging enterprises had the greatest levels of unorganized VOCs emissions, consisting predominantly of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), followed by alkanes and halocarbons. From metal and paper packaging enterprises, OVOCs, alkanes, and aromatics were significant components of unorganized VOCs emissions. Aromatics, halocarbons, and OVOCs contributed significantly to OFP in workshops. The potential carcinogenic risk associated with VOCs in the packaging and printing industries was not significant. However, according to the findings in this study, the workshop environment may provide a comparatively elevated non-carcinogenic risk attributable to ethyl acetate, isopropanol, acrolein, 1,1,2-Trichloroethane, 1,2-Dichloropropane, and naphthalene exposure. In particular, the endocrine-disrupting and genetic toxic effects caused by benzene, toluene, styrene, and naphthalene should not be overlooked. Thus, it is essential to provide precedence to the working environment conditions of workshop laborers, while also undertaking scientific and systematic measures to mitigate the detrimental impacts of VOCs on the environment and human welfare."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
