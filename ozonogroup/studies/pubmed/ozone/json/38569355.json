Second-order rate constants for the reactions of candesartan, irbesartan, methyl-benzotriazole, and chloro\u2011benzotriazole with sulfate radical (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u00b7-</sup>) were determined for the first time. Experiments were conducted in buffered pure water, in buffered water added with the matrix substituents chloride, carbonate, NOM, and reverse osmosis concentrate with spiked micropollutants (MP). UV/persulfate eliminated all MP to a higher extent than ozonation in RO concentrates due to the higher yield of oxidative species and photolytic degradation. Compounds with electron-rich moieties such as carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol, and sulfamethoxazole were completely eliminated with small ozone doses (< 0.5 mg O<sub>3</sub> / mg DOC) and with a small fluence (< 5000 J m<sup>-2</sup>) in UV/persulfate processes. Photosensitive compounds with high reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u00b7</sup>OH) and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u00b7-</sup> like the x-ray contrast media Iopamidol, Iohexol, and Amidotrizoic acid were successfully eliminated with a reasonable fluence in UV/persulfate, whereas these compounds persist in ozonation at common ozone dosages. However, much higher fluences and ozone dosages were required for the least reactive compounds like the class of benzotriazoles. Comparing the application of both oxidative processes to the RO concentrate, ozonation has the disadvantage of forming bromate. The energy input of both processes strongly depends on the target compounds to be eliminated. For the elimination of compounds such as sulfamethoxazole, ozonation is a feasible technique, whereas UV/persulfate is better suited for the elimination of recalcitrant compounds such as x-ray contrast media. In general, oxidative process treatment of RO concentrate could be applied to partly abate micropollutants before discharge."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
