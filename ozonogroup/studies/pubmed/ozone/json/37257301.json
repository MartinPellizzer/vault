This may have importance for improving the osteointegration of orthopedic implants. At high concentrations gallium is cytotoxic. Therefore, integration of gallium into implant devices must be carefully controlled to limit its concentration and release. A strategy based on surface doping of gallium although challenging seems an appropriate approach to limit dose amounts to minimize cytotoxicity and maximize osteointegration benefits. In this work we develop a novel form of patterned surface doping via a block copolymer-based surface chemistry that enables very low gallium content but enhanced osteointegration as proven by comprehensive bioassays. Polystyrene-b-poly 4vinyl pyridine (PS-b-P4VP) BCP (block copolymer) films were produced on surfaces. Selective infiltration of the BCP pattern with a gallium salt precursor solution and subsequent UV-ozone treatment produced a surface pattern of gallium oxide nanodots as evidenced by atomic force and scanning electron microscopy. A comprehensive study of the bioactivity was carried out, including antimicrobial and sterility testing, gallium ion release kinetics and the interaction with human marrow mesenchymal stomal cells and mononuclear cells. Comparing the data from osteogenesis media assay tests with osteoclastogenesis tests demonstrated the potential for the gallium oxide nanodot doping to improve osteointegration properties of a surface."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
