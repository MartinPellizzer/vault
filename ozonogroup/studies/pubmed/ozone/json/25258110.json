Mitochondrial dysfunction and antioxidant/prooxidant imbalance are emerging as factors that contribute to epileptogenesis. As medical ozone was able to reestablish cellular redox balance and to maintain the protective effects mediated by A1 receptors (A1Rs), the aim of this work was to study ozone's effects on antioxidant/prooxidant balance and to clarify if A1Rs play a role in ozone's protective actions against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice.", "Influence of ozone's treatments in mice submitted to PTZ-induced seizures was studied. Ozone was administered by rectal insufflation 1 mg/kg (5, 10, 15, 20 treatments), one per day, of 1-1\u00b75 ml at an ozone concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml. Mice received PTZ (90 mg/kg i.p.) 24 hours after the last ozone treatment. Oxygen control groups 26 mg/kg were introduced. Latency to first seizure was determined. Antioxidant/prooxidant balance in brain homogenates was studied. A1 adenosine receptors' effects on ozone's protective actions against seizures were evaluated using 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX).", "Highest latency was observed when mice received 15 ozone treatments. Oxygen + PTZ group did not achieve protection against neither convulsions nor brain oxidative injury. Fifteen treatments of ozone protected against biomolecules oxidative damage and the antioxidant systems as well. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine abolished the ozone's protection.", "Ozone therapy increased the latency for the first seizure and the survival percentage. These effects are discussed in point of ozone's capacity to reestablish cellular redox balance, decrease biomolecules damage, and regulate activation of A1 adenosine receptors in PTZ-induced seizures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mallok", "ForeName": "Akel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vaillant", "ForeName": "Jaqueline Dranguet", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soto", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda Teresa D\u00edaz", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Viebahn-H\u00e4nsler", "ForeName": "Renate", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Viart", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda de Los Angeles B\u00e9quer", "Initials": "Mde L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "Angela Fraga", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cede\u00f1o", "ForeName": "Rubens Iv\u00e1n Donoso", "Initials": "RI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Olga Sonia Le\u00f3n", "Initials": "OS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Neurol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7905298", "ISSNLinking": "0161-6412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine A1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor, Adenosine A1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9PTP4FOI9E", "NameOfSubstance": "1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WM5Z385K7T", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentylenetetrazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine A1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pentylenetetrazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptor, Adenosine A1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seizures"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25258110", "10.1179/1743132814Y.0000000445"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
