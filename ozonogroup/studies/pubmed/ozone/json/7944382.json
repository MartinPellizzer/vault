Several oxidizing protocols including: (a) Fe(II) or Fe(III)/ascorbate, (b) a singlet oxygen producing system (methylene blue and visible light), (c) ozone, and (d) a hydroxyl radical-generating system (hydrogen peroxide/uv light) have been employed. Our results show that both enzymes are susceptible to oxidative modification and damage as indicated by the loss of activity and formation of carbonyl groups (in the case of GR). Treatment of GR with any of the mentioned oxidants resulted in formation of carbonyl groups and inactivation except when treated with iron, where the observed carbonyl formation was not accompanied with significant activity loss. GPX was inactivated to varying degrees when treated with the mentioned oxidants, but no carbonyls were detected. Ultraviolet exposure per se resulted in inactivation of both enzymes. Presence of the spin traps N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone or 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyroline-N-oxide was effective in protecting the enzymes against oxidation by uv, hydrogen peroxide/uv, and ozone as determined by the preservation of activity and decreased carbonyl content. The degree of protection, however, was found to be specific for each enzyme and for the employed oxidizing system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Free Radical Biology and Aging Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tabatabaie", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Floyd", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AG 09690", "Acronym": "AG", "Agency": "NIA NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA 42854", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "NS 23307", "Acronym": "NS", "Agency": "NINDS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic N-Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spin Labels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3I91332OPG", "NameOfSubstance": "phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7170JZ1QF3", "NameOfSubstance": "5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T42P99266K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylene Blue"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic N-Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methylene Blue"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spin Labels"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7944382", "10.1006/abbi.1994.1418", "S0003-9861(84)71418-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
