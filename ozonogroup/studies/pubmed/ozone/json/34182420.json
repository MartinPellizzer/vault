Although the transformation of parent compounds (PCs) and their metabolites has been reported in the literature, the probable transformation of biotransformation products has not been investigated so far. This study evaluates the fate of citalopram (CTR) and four of its biotransformation products (DESCTR, CTRAM, CTRAC and CTROXO) during ozonation experiments. A Gaussian curve-based trend analysis was performed for the first time for the automated detection of TPs in ozone concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 12\u00a0mg/L. In total 46 ozonation TPs were detected; 7 TPs of CTR, 10 of DESCTR, 9 of CTRAM, 12 of CTRAC and 8 of CTROXO and were structurally elucidated based on their high resolution tandem mass spectra interpretation and tandem mass spectra similarity with the respective PC. Results have demonstrated that the examined compounds follow common transformation pathways in reaction with ozone and that common TPs were formed through the ozonation of different structurally-alike compounds. Moreover, the toxicity of the identified TPs was predicted with an in-house risk assessment program."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
