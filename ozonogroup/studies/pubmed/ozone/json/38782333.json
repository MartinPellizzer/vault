Ozone risks are normally described as relative risks (RRs), which are calculated by assuming the biomass or yield at zero O<sub>3</sub> dose as \"reference\". However, the estimation of the reference biomass or yield is challenging due to a lack of O<sub>3</sub>-clean-air treatment at the FACEs and the extrapolation without data in a low O<sub>3</sub> range increases the bias for estimating the reference values. Here, we reviewed a current methodology for the risk assessment at FACEs and presented a simple and effective way (\"modified Paoletti's approach\") of defining RRs just using biomass or yield data with a range of expected impacts under the FACE conditions hypothesizing three possible scenarios based on prediction limits using 95% credible intervals (CI) (1. Best fit using the intercept as reference, 2. Optimistic scenario using a lower CI and 3. Worst scenario using an upper CI). As a result, O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive species show a relatively narrow effect range (optimistic vs. worst scenario) whereas a wide range of response may be possibly taken in resistant species. Showing a possible effect range allows for a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks and its uncertainties related to a species sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub>. As a supporting approach, we also recommend to use scientifically relevant tools (i.e., ethylenediurea treatments; mechanistic plant models) for strengthening the obtained results for the RRs against O<sub>3</sub>. Interestingly, the moderately sensitive or resistant species showed non-linear rather than linear dose-response relationships, suggesting a need for the flexible functional form for the risk assessment to properly describe the complex plant response such as hormesis, which depends on their plasticity to O<sub>3</sub> stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
