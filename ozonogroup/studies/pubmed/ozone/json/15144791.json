The forecasting tools developed are fuzzy expert and neural network systems. The hourly data for air pollutants and meteorological variables, obtained both at the surface and at the high elevation (500 hPa) stations of Seoul City for the period of 1989-1999, were analyzed. Two types of forecast models are developed. The first model, Part I, uses a fuzzy expert system and forecasts the possibility of high ozone levels (equal to or above 80 ppb) occurring on the next day. The second model, Part II, uses a neural network system to forecast the daily maximum concentration of ozone on the following day. The forecasting system includes a correction function so that the existing model can be updated whenever a new ozone episode appears. The accuracy of the forecasting system has been improved continuously through verification and augmentation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copryright 2003 Elsevier B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Environmental and Applied Chemistry, Kyung-Hee University, Yongin-City, Kyunggi-do 449-701 South Korea. jshswl@hanmail.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Jeong-Sook", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong-Sool", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15144791", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2003.11.009", "S0048-9697(03)00662-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
