[Subjects and Methods] Sixty patients with femoral trochanteric fractures were investigated retrospectively. Based on the mean period from surgery to discharge (85.6 \u00b1 26.6 days), the patients were divided into two groups: an under-85-day group (range, 29-78 days) and an over-85-day group (87-128 days). Age, gender, fracture type, presence of lesser trochanteric displacement, discharge destination, and walking ability were investigated. The relationship between these factors and the period from surgery to discharge was analyzed with logistic regression analysis. [Results] Age and lesser trochanteric displacement were significantly higher in the over-85-day group, and walking ability before fracture and at discharge were significantly lower in the over-85-day group. Logistic regression analysis showed that lesser trochanteric displacement and age were predictors of the length from surgery to discharge. Lesser trochanteric displacement were observed in 87.5% of these. Immediate displacement after surgery occurred in 57.8% of lesser trochanteric fractures, while 26.3% displaced 1 to 3 weeks after surgery. [Conclusion] This study revealed that lesser trochanteric displacement, higher age, and lower walking ability before fracture and at discharge were associated with longer hospitalizations in patients with femoral trochanteric fractures. Lesser trochanteric displacement were observed in 87.5% of lesser trochanteric fractures. These displacements occurred within 3 weeks after surgery in 84.1% of cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, Ichihara Hospital: 3681 Ozone, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 300-3295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Shinoda", "ForeName": "Soichiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ibaraki Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Japan."}], "LastName": "Mutsuzaki", "ForeName": "Hirotaka", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ichihara Hospital, Japan."}], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Arata", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, Ichihara Hospital: 3681 Ozone, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 300-3295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Hidetaka", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, School of Healthcare, Ibaraki Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kamioka", "ForeName": "Yumiko", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Ther Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9105359", "ISSNLinking": "0915-5287"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Orimo H, Yaegashi Y, Onoda T, et al. : Hip fracture incidence in Japan: estimates of new patients in 2007 and 20-year trends.
