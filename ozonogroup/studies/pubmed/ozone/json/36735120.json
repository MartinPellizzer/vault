PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for eligible articles published between database inception and October 2021. Meta-analysis weighted by inverse-variance was utilized to pool effect estimates based on the type of air pollutant, including particulate matters (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>: particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter\u2009\u2264\u20092.5\u00a0\u00b5m and\u2009\u2264\u200910\u00a0\u00b5m), gaseous pollutants (NO<sub>2</sub>: nitrogen dioxide; CO: carbon monoxide; SO<sub>2</sub>: sulfur dioxide, and O<sub>3</sub>: ozone). Study-specific effect estimates were standardized and calculated with percentage change of angina pectoris for each 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in air pollutant concentration. Twelve studies involving 663,276 angina events from Asia, America, Oceania, and Europe were finally included. Meta-analysis showed that each 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentration was associated with an increase of 0.66% (95%CI: 0.58%, 0.73%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 0.57% (95%CI: 0.20%, 0.94%; p\u2009=\u20090.003) in the risk of angina pectoris on the second day of exposure. Adverse effects were also observed for NO<sub>2</sub> (0.67%, 95%CI: 0.33%, 1.02%; p\u2009<\u2009v0.001) on the second day, CO (0.010%, 95%CI: 0.006%, 0.014%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The elderly and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) appeared to be at higher risk of angina pectoris. Our findings suggest that short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO was associated with an increased risk of angina pectoris, which may have implications for cardiologists and patients to prevent negative cardiovascular outcomes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
