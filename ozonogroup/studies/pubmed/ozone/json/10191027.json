This was performed by heating samples to different temperatures and later, saturating a part of them in aqueous cadmium sulfate solutions. Analyses were practiced on both the cadmium ion exchanged and un-ion exchanged samples. Results showed that the ion exchange reaction followed a stoichiometric relation between the hydrogen and cadmium ions, promoted by the combined water. The molar ratio of combined water to exchanged cadmium was found to be five. X rays and photographs taken in the scanning electron microscope showed that the structure and morphology of the OMD were not modified by the insertion of the cadmium during ion exchange. From the X rays, the structure of the OMD was determined to be of the gamma type. When the samples were heated to 400 and 500 degrees C, the crystal structure changed to beta and finally to Mn2O3, respectively. However, the changes in structure alone apparently did not affect the ion exchange. The surface area, measured by the BET technique, diminished linearly with the preheat temperature. The ion exchanged cadmium and the surface area showed a nonlinear relationship. However, the surface area and the quantity of combined water in the OMD were both linearly affected by preheating and are directly related to the ion exchange capacity.
