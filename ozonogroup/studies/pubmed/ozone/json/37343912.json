The differences in VOC compositions and their effects determined using different methods have not been addressed sufficiently. In this study, VOC samples are obtained from single gasoline and diesel vehicle exhausts using a portable emission measurement system, from a tunnel in Yichang City, and from gasoline and diesel evaporation at gas stations. A total of 107 VOCs are analysed. The calculated VOC source profiles (based on VOC source profiles of single-vehicle type and vehicle fleet composition in the tunnel) and the tested source profiles (from a tunnel test) are compared. The results show that gasoline burning can reduce alkenes from a mass fraction of 53.1% (for evaporation) to 3.6% (for burning), as well as increase the mass fraction of alkenes from 1.3% (for diesel evaporation) to 34.0% (for diesel burning). The calculated VOC source profiles differed from the tested VOC source profiles, with a coefficient of divergence of 0.6. Ethane, ethylene, n-undecane, and n-dodecane are used to distinguish VOCs in gasoline and diesel exhausts. Cis-2-butene, 2-methylpentane, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, and n-decane can be used to separate gasoline from diesel. The xylene/ethylbenzene ratios accurately reveal the photochemical age. Gasoline burning increases health risks associated with VOCs compared with gasoline evaporation. Furthermore, it modifies the main contributor to ozone formation potential. This study is expected to facilitate refined VOC source apportionment and studies pertaining to speciated emission inventories."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
