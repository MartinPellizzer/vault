However, this method uses substantial amount of water. The ozone-down-flow hanging sponge-up-flow sludge blanket (ozone-DHS-USB) system attempts to be a more responsible method for aquarium maintenance. It eliminates the necessity for water exchange in aquarium by maintaining nitrogen concentrations at a safe level and by reducing yellow substances. Also, the impact of O<sub>3</sub> on the DHS-USB system was investigated. The system was assayed using an on-site freshwater aquarium influenced by ambient temperature ranging from 23\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C. During ozonation Phases 1 and 3, the colour of the water in the aquarium was successfully maintained below 10 colour units. The 16S rRNA gene analysis of microorganisms in the DHS revealed that constant application of O<sub>3</sub> has caused a decrease in nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Nevertheless, NH<sub>3</sub> and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msubsup><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></math> were maintained within 0.1\u2005mg N L<sup>-1</sup>, and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msubsup><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></math> was maintained at 14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.20\u2005mg N L<sup>-1</sup> throughout the study. Carps survived for 425 days without any water exchange performed. Our study supports that the ozone-DHS-USB system has a high potential towards creating low-maintenance aquaria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science of Technology Innovation, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Adlin", "ForeName": "Nur", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hatamoto", "ForeName": "Masashi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Social Design Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Kochi College, Kochi, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamazaki", "ForeName": "Shinichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Watari", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science of Technology Innovation, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32552551", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1784295"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
