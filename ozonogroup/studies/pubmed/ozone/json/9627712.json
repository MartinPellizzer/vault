Given this alarming statistic, which may be further exacerbated by increased ultraviolet B irradiation from ozone depletion, it is vital that realistic, relevant model systems are developed to increase our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis that result in or evaluate new treatment modalities. Toward this goal, the ability to stably introduce genes into the germline of mice has greatly enhanced prospects for generation of transgenic animal models of multistage molecular carcinogenesis. Moreover, when genes are combined with regulatory sequences that target their expression to specific tissues, investigators are able to study neoplasia both in the context of living organisms and in the tissues suspected of being the targets of these genes. The epidermis is an attractive tissue for targeted gene expression; not only is it a model for epithelial diseases in general, but the accessibility of the epidermis allows easy detection of progressive pathological changes that result from transgene expression and facilitates assessment of the potential role played by environmental factors. We have developed a targeting vector based on the human keratin gene (HK1), which is expressed exclusively in the epidermis of transgenic mice, at a late stage in development and in both basal and differentiated cells. Through the use of this targeting ability, rasHa, fos, and TGF alpha transgenic mice have been developed that exhibit preneoplastic epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, and later benign, regression prone papillomas. Together, coexpression of two oncogenes cooperated to give autonomous papillomas, which possessed the phenotypic stability to allow assessment of a third genetic event, namely loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, via mating with p53 knockout mice. Loss of p53 expression, however, identified a paradoxical block of papillomatogenesis. This latter result suggests that the epidermis possesses several mechanisms that can effectively compensate for the loss of important tumor suppressor functions and may have evolved to render the skin relatively resistant to the effects of environmental carcinogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greenhalgh", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X J", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roop", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AI30283", "Acronym": "AI", "Agency": "NIAID NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA52607", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HD25479", "Acronym": "HD", "Agency": "NICHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc", "NlmUniqueID": "9609059", "ISSNLinking": "1087-0024"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, fos"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, p53"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, ras"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Transgenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor alpha"}], "NumberOfReferences": "141"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9627712"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
