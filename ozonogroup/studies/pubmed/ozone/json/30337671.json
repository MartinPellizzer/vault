We examined if neighborhood asthma prevalence (higher: HAPN vs. lower: LAPN), a surrogate for underlying risk factors for asthma, modified the relationship between pollutants and urgent asthma visits.", "Through zip code, home addresses were linked to New York City Community Air Survey's land use regression model for street-level, annual average nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), elemental carbon (EC), summer average ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), winter average sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations. Poisson regression models were fit to estimate the association (prevalence ratio, PR) between pollutant exposures and seeking urgent asthma care.", "All pollutants, except O<sub>3</sub> were higher in HAPN than LAPN (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Neighborhood asthma prevalence modified the relationship between pollutants and urgent asthma (P-interaction\u2009<\u20090.01, for NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub>). Associations between pollutants and urgent asthma were observed only in LAPN (NO<sub>2</sub>: PR\u2009=\u20091.38, P\u2009=\u20090.01; SO<sub>3</sub>: PR\u2009=\u20091.85, P\u2009=\u20090.04).
