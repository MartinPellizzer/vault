The treated soymilk was characterized for physical, chemical, nutritional, rheological, particle size, zeta potential, sensory and storage stability characteristics. The results revealed that 1, 4-\u03b2-D-glucan incorporation increased the acidity (0.67 to 0.73\u00a0%), viscosity (3.4 to 4.7 Cp) and ash content (0.74 to 0.92\u00a0%), however color remains natural. The frequency sweep and shear experiments showed that the 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan modified the rheological parameters of the soymilk. The sensory analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a030) indicated that texture, mouthfeel and overall acceptability (8.38). Compared to Oz\u03b2G-treated soymilk, Ut\u03b2G soymilk, especially S<sub>2</sub>, exhibited superior thickening and rheological properties. The storage study indicated minimal phase separation in 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan-incorporated samples, maintaining stability for 15\u00a0days under refrigerated conditions without compromising overall quality. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into the potential application of 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan for improving the technological quality of soymilk that highlights possible implications for its commercialization potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
