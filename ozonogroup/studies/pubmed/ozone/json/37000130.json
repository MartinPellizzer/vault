Upon the removal of the OSDA, either by thermal treatment in air at temperatures exceeding 490 \u00b0C or by extended ozone treatment at 150 \u00b0C, CIT-16P transforms to SAPO-17 (ERI topology). The structure solution of CIT-16P in its as-synthesized form is obtained using a Rietveld refinement of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The primary composite building units (CBUs) of CIT-16P are highly distorted cancrinite (<i>can</i>) CBUs that transform into stable <i>can</i> units of the ERI-type framework as a result of the OSDA removal. The distortion of <i>can</i> CBU is maintained without transformation by the presence of tightly bound DiQ-C<sub>4</sub> dications in the as-synthesized form of CIT-16P. The transformed material is characterized and evaluated as a catalyst in the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction. The catalytic behavior of the formed SAPO-17 (Si/T-atom = 0.022) (T = Si + Al + P) at 400 \u00b0C and WHSV of 1.3 h<sup>-1</sup> produces elevated C<sub>3+</sub> olefin products (<i>i.e.</i>, propylene, butenes, and pentenes) in early stages of the reaction. However, as the reaction proceeds, the C<sub>3+</sub> fraction decreases in favor of more ethylene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, United States."}], "LastName": "Alshafei", "ForeName": "Faisal H", "Initials": "FH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4197-9070"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Jong Hun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Chonnam National University, Yongbong-Ro 77, Buk-gu, Gwangju 61186, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Sung June", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8294-1477"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, United States."}], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Mark E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37000130", "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c04539"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
