Equations for the diffuse reflection in an inhomogeneous atmosphere are introduced, and some theoretical approximations are discussed. An inversion equation is formulated in such a way that the change of radiance at each wavelength, caused by the minute relative increment of ozone density at each altitude, is obtained exactly. The equation is solved by an iterative procedure using the weight function obtained in this work. The results of computer simulation indicate that the ozone distribution from the mesopause to the tropopause can be determined, and that although it is impossible to suggest exactly the complicated profile with fine structure, the smoothed ozone distribution and the total content can be determined with almost the same accuracy as the accuracies of measurement and theoretical calculation of the spectral intensity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aruga", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Igarashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20155214", "10.1364/AO.15.000261", "19891"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
