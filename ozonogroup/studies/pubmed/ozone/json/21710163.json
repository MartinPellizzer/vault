Effects of initial pH in water, stirring speed, initial molar ratio of O(3)/p-chloronitrobenzene (M), and free radical scavenger on the removal rate of p-chloronitrobenzene were investigated respectively. It was revealed that ozone had low decomposed rate coefficient k = 0.0035 min(-1) and solubility of 61.94 mg/L at 25\u00b0C in perfluorocarbon. In contrast to pH 2.0, higher level of pH (8.0) in water increased the removal rate of p-chloronitrobenzene in water/perfluorocarbon two-phase ozonation system. Removal rate of p-chloronitrobenzene was increased with the elevation of initial M value in water/perfluorocarbon two-phase ozonation system. Stirring speed was needed to control with proper level of speed in water/perfluorocarbon two-phase system. Compared to the conventional gas/water ozonation system, NaHCO(3) (20 mmol/L) had no obvious negative effect on the p-chloronitrobenzene degradation in water/perfluorocarbon ozonation system. Oxidation efficiency of ozonation in water/perfluorocarbon system was superior to that of in conventional gas/water system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, School of Geographical Science, Nanjing Normal University, China. lishiyin7@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shiyin", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yiping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaorong", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guoxiang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Lixiao", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54A06VV62N", "NameOfSubstance": "perfluorodecalin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8MDF5V39QO", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Bicarbonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CVL66U249D", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chloronitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Bicarbonate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21710163", "10.1007/s00128-011-0352-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
