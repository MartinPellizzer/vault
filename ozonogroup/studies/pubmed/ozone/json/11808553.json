At all sites (elevation between 450 and 1320 m) concentrations of O3, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were measured with passive samplers. In addition, in two western Carpathian locations, Vychodna and Gubal\u00f3wka, ozone was continuously monitored with ultraviolet (UV) absorption monitors. Highest average hourly O3 concentrations in the Vychodna and Guba\u0142\u00f3wka sites reached 160 and 200 microg/m3 (82 and 102 ppb), respectively (except for the AOT40 values, ozone concentrations are presented as microg/m3; and at 25 degrees C and 760 mm Hg, 1 microg O3/m3 = 0.51 ppb O3). These sites showed drastically different patterns of diurnal 03 distribution, one with clearly defined peaks in the afternoon and lowest values in the morning, the other with flat patterns during the entire 24-h period. On two elevational transects, no effect of elevation on O3 levels was seen on the first one, while on the other a significant increase of O3 levels with elevation occurred. Concentrations of O3 determined with passive samplers were significantly different between individual monitoring years, monitoring periods, and geographic location of the monitoring sites. Results of passive sampler monitoring showed that high O3 concentrations could be expected in many parts of the Carpathian range, especially in its western part, but also in the eastern and southern ranges. More than four-fold denser network of monitoring sites is required for reliable estimates of O3 distribution in forests over the entire Carpathian range (140 points). Potential phytotoxic effects of O3 on forest trees and understory vegetation are expected on almost the entire territory of the Carpathian Mountains. This assumption is based on estimates of the AOT40 indices for forest trees and natural vegetation. Concentrations of NO2 and SO2 in the entire Carpathian range were typical for this part of Europe and below the expected levels of phytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, Riverside, USA. andrzej@deltanet.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bytnerowicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godzik", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fraczek", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grodzi\u0144ska", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krywult", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Badea", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barancok", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blum", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cerny", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godzik", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mankovska", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manning", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moravcik", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Musselman", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oszlanyi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Postelnicu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szd\u017auj", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varsavova", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zota", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11808553", "10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00187-7", "S0269-7491(01)00187-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
