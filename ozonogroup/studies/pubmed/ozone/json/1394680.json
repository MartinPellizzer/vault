The decomposed DBS solutions after these treatments for 4 h were mutagenic for strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 both with and without S9 mix, but this mutagenicity disappeared rapidly during further ozone/UV treatment. Mutagenicity of the decomposed solution of DBS, however, was not substantially decreased by treatment with ozone alone. Formaldehyde and glyoxal were identified as the decomposition products of DBS in water by high-performance liquid chromatography after treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Although these two compounds were mutagenic for strain TA104 both with and without S9 mix, they disappeared after further ozone/UV treatment but not after ozone treatment alone. These results indicate that ozone/UV treatment is an effective procedure for purifying drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murakami", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinouchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60NSK897G9", "NameOfSubstance": "dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Benzenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1394680", "10.1248/cpb.40.1597"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
