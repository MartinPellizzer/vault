Addition of a NN to planar monolayers of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) activated by Ca2+ ionophore A23187 immediately resulted in a strong decrease of the ozone-mediated .NO chemiluminescence. Simultaneously, a rapid diminution of the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal intensity of the NN (without detectable formation of the corresponding imino nitroxide) was observed; superoxide dismutase partially inhibited this decrease in the NN concentration. Model experiments using hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase in aqueous solution and KO2 in dimethylsulfoxide as sources of O2.- revealed that there is a rapid reduction of nitronyl nitroxides by superoxide. The second order rate constant for the reaction of the water soluble NN with O2.- was determined to be 8.8 x 10(5) M-1s-1, which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the value reported previously for reaction with .NO (Woldman et al., BBRC 202, 195-203, 1994). Reduction of the nitronyl nitroxide was also observed in the presence of glutathione, ascorbic acid or rabbit liver microsomes. Incorporation of both nitronyl and imino nitroxides into liposomes strongly decreased reduction by superoxide and other reductants, however, in the presence of microsomes, there was no protective effect by liposomal encapsulation of NN. The results indicate that in biological systems (in addition to other reducing agents) the presence of superoxide can prevent the detection of nitric oxide using nitronyl nitroxides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Pharmacology, Berlin, Germany.
