Growing season mean hourly O(3) concentrations were 36.3 and 47.3 ppb for ambient and elevated O(3) plots, respectively. The 4th highest daily maximum 8-h ambient and elevated O(3) concentrations were 79 and 89 ppb, respectively. Elevated CO(2) averaged 524 ppm (+150 ppm) over the growing season. Exposure to O(3) and CO(2) in combination with O(3) increased DNA damage levels above background as measured by the comet assay. Ozone-tolerant clones 271 and 8L showed the highest levels of DNA damage under elevated O(3) compared with ambient air; whereas less tolerant clone 216 and sensitive clones 42E and 259 had comparably lower levels of DNA damage with no significant differences between elevated O(3) and ambient air. Clone 8L was demonstrated to have the highest level of excision DNA repair. In addition, clone 271 had the highest level of oxidative damage as measured by lipid peroxidation. The results suggest that variation in cellular responses to DNA damage between aspen clones may contribute to O(3) tolerance or sensitivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "2009.
