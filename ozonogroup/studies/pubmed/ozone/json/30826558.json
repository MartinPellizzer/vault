Effects of initial influent pH, mass ratio of filings to wastewater, air aeration rate, and reaction temperature on the removal of MDEA were investigated intensively. Experimental results indicate that optimum removal rate of MDEA can be obtained at pH\u2009=\u20092, inlet air rate\u2009=\u20091\u2009L\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>, mass ratio of filings to wastewater\u2009=\u20091:1 and temperature\u2009=\u200925\u2009\u00b0C. About 96.0% Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in overhaul wastewater can be mineralized by ozonation-microelectrolysis-ozonation (OMIO) treatment process. By analyzing the effluent at various stages, it was established that microelectrolysis played a leading role in the destruction of MDEA. The degradation mechanism of MDEA has been clarified through detecting the degradation products with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). Subsequently, ozone reacts with intermediate products generated by MDEA degration through OH\u00b7 pathway under alkaline condition. In short, these results suggest that OMIO system should be proposed as a promising treatment process for the MDEA wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
