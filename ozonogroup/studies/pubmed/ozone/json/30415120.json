In this research, the degradation behavior of dEfOM and fourteen OMPs in the ozonation was revealed using spectroscopic and chromatographic tools. Ozonation was effective for reducing UV<sub>254</sub>, but had limited effect in dissolved organic carbon reduction. The dEfOM with shorter absorption wavelength was preferentially removed in the ozonation (230\u202fnm\u202f\u202f>\u202f\u202f240\u202fnm\u202f>\u202f254\u202fnm) and high molecular weight humics was largely reduced by the ozonation. Soluble microbial by-products were more reactive with ozone than humic acid as reflected by the fluorescence. Degradation behavior of the OMPs was identified based on their elimination kinetics and molecular structures and a simplified classification method was proposed. The group I OMPs (logk<sub>O3</sub>>5) showed high removal efficiency with 1\u202fmg/L of ozone, while the removal of group II OMPs (1< logk<sub>O3</sub><5) was largely dependent on the ozone dose. The CC bond, deprotonated amidogen, phenolic, aniline and anisole groups in these OMPs structures were the main reaction sites with ozone. The group III OMPs without active groups in the molecules showed slight removal in the ozonation. Moreover, genotoxicity and estrogenic activity were simultaneously analyzed for further evaluation on the risk of the effluent. The genotoxicity and estrogenic activity of the secondary effluent were 73.46\u202f\u03bcg 4-NQO/L and 519.86\u202fng E2/L, respectively and an ozone dose of 10\u202fmg/L could reduce the bio-toxicity to the detection limit."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
