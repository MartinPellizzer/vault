The pretreatment conditions included US power 200\u00a0W, ozone concentration 4.2\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/L, and pretreatment time 0-30\u00a0min. The results showed that US/ozone pretreatment was effective in the inactivation of enteric indicator bacteria. Total coliforms and enterococci were reduced by 99% and 92% after 30\u00a0min US/ozone pretreatment. Pretreatments could not decrease ARGs in absolute concentration, but could decrease ARGs in relative abundance. In the subsequent AD process, methane production increased more than 10% with 20\u00a0min ozone or 20\u00a0min US/ozone pretreatments. Pretreatment-AD together obviously inhibited the enrichment of ARGs in relative abundance. This study provided a pretreatment way to enhance methane production and to prevent the enrichment of ARGs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
