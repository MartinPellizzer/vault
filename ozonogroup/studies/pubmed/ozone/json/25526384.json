Currently, no method can determine trace levels of alkyl and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) of varying physical and chemical properties in water by a single analysis. To tackle this difficulty, we developed a single solid-phase extraction (SPE) method with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the determination of 14 nitrosamines of health concern with widely differing properties. We made a cartridge composed of a vinyl/divinylbenzene polymer that efficiently concentrated the 14 nitrosamines in 100 mL of water (in contrast to 500 mL in other methods). This single SPE-HPLC-MS/MS technique provided calculated method detection limits of 0.01-2.7 ng/L and recoveries of 53-93% for the 14 nitrosamines. We have successfully demonstrated that this method can determine the presence or absence of the 14 nitrosamines in drinking water systems (eight were evaluated in Canada and the U.S.), with occurrence similar to that in other surveys. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and the TSNA 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol were identified and quantified in authentic drinking water. Formation potential (FP) tests demonstrated that NDMA and TSNA precursors were present in (1) water samples in which tobacco was leached and (2) wastewater-impacted drinking water. Our results showed that prechlorination or ozonation destroyed most of the nitrosamine precursors in water. Our new single method determination of alkylnitrosamines and TSNAs significantly reduced the time and resource demands of analysis and will enable other studies to more efficiently study precursor sources, formation mechanisms, and removal techniques. It will be useful for human exposure and health risk assessments of nitrosamines in drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta , Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2G3, Canada."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Yichao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Minghuo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Beibei", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krasner", "ForeName": "Stuart W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hrudey", "ForeName": "Steve E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xing-Fang", "Initials": "XF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25526384", "10.1021/ac504104k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
