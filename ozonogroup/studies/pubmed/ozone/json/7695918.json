The magnitude of this response to ozone exposure in mice is inbred strain dependent with the susceptible phenotype being exemplified by the C57BL/6J (B6) strain and the resistant phenotype by the C3H/HeJ (C3) strain. To examine the role of T lymphocytes in the regulation of ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation, mice were pretreated by an intraperitoneal injection of anti-Thy1.2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CD4+ mAb, or isotype-matched control antibodies (0.5 mg each) and subsequently exposed for 72 h to either filtered air or ozone (0.3 ppm). Immediately after ozone exposure, the cellular profile in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) was assessed. In isotype-treated controls of both strains of mice, ozone exposure induced significant increases in the numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells recovered in the BALF; however, the magnitude of each cell type recovered was significantly greater in B6 mice as compared with C3 mice. Both anti-Thy1.2 and anti-CD4+ monoclonal antibody treatments decreased the number of each cell type recovered in the B6 mice and increased the number of cells in the C3 mice. To determine if the CD4+ T-cell-derived cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 was involved in the differential effect of T-cell depletion on the ozone-induced inflammatory responses of C3 and B6 mice, mice were pretreated with either 400 ng of recombinant mouse IL-4 or vehicle, or 5.0 mg anti-IL-4 receptor monoclonal antibody or an isotype-matched antibody before either air or ozone exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gavett", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wills-Karp", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ESO3819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL43312", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Interleukin-4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Mitogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "207137-56-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-4"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Depletion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Interleukin-4"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Mitogen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7695918", "10.1165/ajrcmb.12.4.7695918"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
