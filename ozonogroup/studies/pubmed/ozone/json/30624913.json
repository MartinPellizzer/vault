However, few studies quantify risks of illness and death, examine their contribution to climate policy benefits, or assess their robustness in light of natural climate variability. We employ an integrated modeling framework of the economy, climate, air quality, and human health to quantify the effect of natural variability on U.S. air pollution impacts under future climate and two global policies (2 and 2.5 \u00b0C stabilization scenarios) using 150 year ensemble simulations for each scenario in 2050 and 2100. Climate change yields annual premature deaths related to fine particulate matter and ozone (95CI: 25\u202f000-120\u202f000), heart attacks (900-9400), and lost work days (3.6M-4.9M) in 2100. It raises air pollution health risks by 20%, while policies avert these outcomes by 40-50% in 2050 and 70-88% in 2100. Natural variability introduces \"climate noise\", yielding some annual estimates with negative cobenefits, and others that reach 100% of annual policy costs. This \"noise\" is three times the magnitude of uncertainty (95CI) in health and economic responses in 2050. Averaging five annual simulations reduces this factor to two, which is still substantially larger than health-related uncertainty. This study quantifies the potential for inaccuracy in climate impacts projected using too few annual simulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of Waterloo , 200 University Avenue West , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada , N2L 3G1."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7899-7558"], "LastName": "Saari", "ForeName": "Rebecca K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of Waterloo , 200 University Avenue West , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada , N2L 3G1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Yufei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monier", "ForeName": "Erwan", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garcia-Menendez", "ForeName": "Fernando", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uncertainty"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30624913", "10.1021/acs.est.8b05094"]}}]}
