We here estimated the county-specific daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentration in Jiangsu Province, China during 2015-2018, using a recently developed spatiotemporal machine learning model at a spatial resolution of 0.1\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.1\u00b0 (\u223c11\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011\u00a0km). Counties were equally divided into urban and rural groups based on the median of the percentage of urban residents across Jiangsu counties obtained from the National Population Census in 2010. We first conducted time-series analyses to estimate the county-specific effect of ozone using generalized linear models, then pooled the effect estimates by random-effects modeling. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the 4-day moving average (lag 0-3) of ambient ozone exposure was associated with increases of 0.66% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36%-0.95%) in daily nonaccidental mortality in rural areas and 0.42% in urban areas (95% CI, 0.27%-0.56%). Short-term ambient ozone exposure was associated with an increased risk of mortality caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Our finding suggests that both urban and rural residents suffer adverse health effects from short-term ozone exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
