Aligned TiO2 nanorods have long been used for potential application in highly efficient perovskite solar cells, but the previously reported efficiencies of perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 nanorod arrays were underrated. Here we show a solvothermal method based on a modified ketone-HCl system with the addition of organic acids suitable for modulation of the TiO2 nanorod array films to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells. Photovoltaic measurements indicated that efficient nanorod-structured perovskite solar cells can be achieved with the length of the nanorods as long as approximately 200 nm. A record efficiency of 18.22% under the reverse scan direction has been optimized by avoiding direct contact between the TiO2 nanorods and the hole transport materials, eliminating the organic residues on the nanorod surfaces using UV-ozone treatment and tuning the nanorod array morphologies through addition of different organic acids in the solvothermal process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pen-Tung Sah Institute of Micro-Nano Science and Technology, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, iChEM (Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials), Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Si-Min", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pen-Tung Sah Institute of Micro-Nano Science and Technology, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pen-Tung Sah Institute of Micro-Nano Science and Technology, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Lin-Long", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Lab for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, iChEM (Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials), Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Su-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pen-Tung Sah Institute of Micro-Nano Science and Technology, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pen-Tung Sah Institute of Micro-Nano Science and Technology, Xiamen University , Xiamen 361005, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China , Chengdu 610054, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Material Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27480286", "10.1021/acsami.6b05971"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
