Utilizing data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China and ChinaCropPhen1km, this paper developed PVOC emission inventories with a resolution of 1\u00a0km for the main crops (rice, maize, and wheat) from 2012 to 2019 in China. The results revealed that pesticide application is an important VOC emission source in China. Specially, the PVOC emissions from the major grain-producing regions in June accounted for approximately 30% of the annual total PVOC emissions in the local regions. The simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting Community Multiscale Air Quality model (WRF-CMAQ) indicated that the PVOC emissions increased the mean maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) ozone concentration across China by 2.5 ppb in June 2019. During the same period, PVOCs in the parts of North China Plain contributed 10% of the ozone formation. Under the comprehensive emission reduction scenario, it is anticipated that by 2025, the joint implementation of measures including reducing pesticide application, improving pesticide utilization efficiency and promoting solvent substitution will decrease PVOC emissions by 60% compared with 2019, thereby mitigating ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
