Estimation of textile wastewater influence on the aquatic systems is a very important issue. Therefore, closing of the water cycle within the factories is a promising method of decreasing its environmental impact as well as operational costs. Taking both reasons into account, the aim of this work was to establish the acute toxicity of the textile wastewater before and after separate chemical, biological as well as combined chemical-biological treatment. For the first time the effects of three different combinations of chemical and biological methods were investigated. The acute toxicity analysis were evaluated using the Microtox<sup>\u00ae</sup> toxicity test. Ozonation in two reactors of working volume 1\u00a0dm<sup>3</sup> (stirred cell) and 20\u00a0dm<sup>3</sup> (bubble column) were tested as chemical process, while biodegradation was conducted in two, different systems - Sequence Batch Reactors (SBR; working volume 1.5\u00a0dm<sup>3</sup>) and Horizontal Continuous Flow Bioreactor (HCFB; working volume 12\u00a0dm<sup>3</sup>). The untreated wastewater had the highest toxicity (EC50 value in range: 3-6%). Ozonation caused lower reduction of the toxicity than biodegradation. In the system with SBR the best results were obtained for the biodegradation followed by the ozonation and additional biodegradation - 96% of the toxicity removal. In the second system (with HCFB) two-stage treatment (biodegradation followed by the ozonation) led to the highest toxicity reduction (98%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
