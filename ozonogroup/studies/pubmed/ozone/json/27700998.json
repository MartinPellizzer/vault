In coagulation-flocculation (CF) process, high turbidity removal efficiency (97.1%) and low COD removal efficiency (10.5%) were obtained under the optimal conditions using Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u00b718H<sub>2</sub>O and CaO. The effluent of CF process (ECF) was further disposed by mFe/Cu/O<sub>3</sub> process, and its key operating parameters were optimized by batch experiments. Optimally, COD removal efficiency of ECF obtained by the mFe/Cu/O<sub>3</sub> process (i.e., 87.6% after 30\u00a0min treatment) was much higher than those of mFe/Cu alone (8.3%), ozone alone (46.6%), and mFe/Cu/air (6.1%), which confirms the superiority of the mFe/Cu/O<sub>3</sub> process. In addition, the analysis results of UV-vis, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra and GC/MS further confirm that the phenol pollutants of ECF had been effectively decomposed or transformed after CF-mFe/Cu/O<sub>3</sub> process treatment. Meanwhile, B/C ratio of ACW increased from 0.19 to 0.56, which suggests the biodegradability was improved significantly. Finally, the operating cost of CF-mFe/Cu/O<sub>3</sub> process was about 1.83 USD t<sup>-1</sup> for ACW treatment. Therefore, the combined process is a promising treatment technology for the coating wastewater from automobile manufacturing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
