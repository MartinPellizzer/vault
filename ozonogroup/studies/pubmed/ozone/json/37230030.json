Besides the well-studied excited triplet states of chromophoric DOM (<sup>3</sup>CDOM*), LLPO presumably are important photooxidants for the transformation of electron-rich contaminants in surface waters. The main objective of this study was to further test the potential role of phenoxyl radical as LLPO. Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) as a model DOM was pre-oxidised using the phenol-reactive oxidants chlorine and ozone, followed by its characterization by the specific UV absorption at 254\u00a0nm (SUVA<sub>254</sub>), the ratio of absorbance at \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0254\u00a0nm and \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0365\u00a0nm (E2:E3), and the electron donating capacity (EDC). Subsequently, the photoreactivity of pre-oxidized SRFA was tested using 3,4-dimethoxyphenol (DMOP) as a LLPO probe compound at two initial concentrations ([DMOP]<sub>0</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.1 and 5.0\u00a0\u03bcM). Linear inter-correlations were observed for the relative changes in SUVA<sub>254</sub>, E2:E3, and EDC for increasing oxidant doses. Pseudo-first-order transformation rate constants normalized to the changing SRFA absorption rate (i.e., k<sub>0.1</sub><sup>obs</sup>/r<sub>CDOM</sub><sup>abs</sup>and k<sub>5.0</sub><sup>obs</sup>/r<sub>CDOM</sub><sup>abs</sup>, for 0.1 and 5.0\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively) exhibited the following distinct trends: The LLPO-dominated k<sub>0.1</sub><sup>obs</sup>/r<sub>CDOM</sub><sup>abs</sup>ratio decreased with increasing oxidant dose and with decreasing SUVA<sub>254</sub> and EDC, while the <sup>3</sup>CDOM*-dominated k<sub>5.0</sub><sup>obs</sup>/r<sub>CDOM</sub><sup>abs</sup>ratio positively correlated with E2:E3. Finally, it was concluded that precursors of <sup>3</sup>CDOM* and LLPO are chemically modified differently by pre-oxidation of DOM, and LLPO precursors likely consist of phenolic moieties of DOM, suggesting phenoxyl radicals as LLPO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
