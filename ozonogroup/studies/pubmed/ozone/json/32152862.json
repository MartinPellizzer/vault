HD 2967 on its growth, gas exchange parameters, and yield attributes in open-top chambers (OTCs). Two sowing dates were considered: timely sown and late sown. Late sowing was delayed by 20\u00a0days from the timely sowing date. The result revealed that wheat plants under elevated O<sub>3</sub> and timely sown conditions (ET) showed reductions in growth parameters, while such effects were synergistic when plants were exposed to elevated O<sub>3</sub> under late sown conditions (EL). Photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency reduced significantly under EL followed by ET and AL as compared with AT (ambient O<sub>3</sub> + timely sown) whereas transpiration rate showed maximum increment under EL. Grain yield reduced by 45.3% in EL as compared with AT and 16.2% in ET as compared with AT. The growth parameters and yield attributes obtained from the present experiment revealed that (i) O<sub>3</sub> is affecting the growth and productivity of the wheat and (ii) late sowing practice has not proved to be a feasible adaptation strategy for the wheat cultivation against O<sub>3</sub>-induced production losses under the prevailing conditions of Indo-Gangetic Plain. This is the first report documenting the shifting of crop calendar practice at the present and future scenario of O<sub>3</sub> concentration under agro-ecological conditions in the tropical region of India."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Annesha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Signal Research Group, Institute of Technology, University of Tartu, Nooruse 1, 50411, Tartu, Estonia."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Ashutosh Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India. sbagrawal56@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Shashi Bhushan", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32152862", "10.1007/s11356-020-08325-y", "10.1007/s11356-020-08325-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
