Real-time data from 76 flights were collected in 2006--2007 with a battery-powered UV photometric monitor. Sample mean ozone level, peak-hour ozone level, and flight-integrated ozone exposures were highly variable across domestic segments (N = 68), with ranges of < 1.5 to 146 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), 3--275 ppbv, and < 1.5 to 488 ppbv-hour, respectively. On planes equipped with ozone catalysts, the mean peak-hour ozone level (4.7 ppbv, N = 22)was substantially lower than on planes not equipped with catalysts (47 ppbv, N = 46). Peak-hour ozone levels on eight transoceanic flight segments, all on planes equipped with ozone catalysts, were in the range < 1.5 to 65 [corrected] ppbv. Seasonal variation on domestic routes without converters is reasonably modeled by a sinusoidal curve that predicts peak-hour levels to be approximately 70 ppbv higher in Feb--March than in Aug--Sept The temporal trend is broadly consistent with expectations, given the seasonal cycle in tropopause height. Episodically elevated (>100 ppbv) ozone levels on domestic flights were associated with winter-spring storms that are linked to enhanced exchange between the lower stratosphere and the upper troposphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil & Environmental Engineering Department, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-1710, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhangar", "ForeName": "Seema", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cowlin", "ForeName": "Shannon C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singer", "ForeName": "Brett C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sextro", "ForeName": "Richard G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nazaroff", "ForeName": "William W", "Initials": "WW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Environ Sci Technol. 2012 Feb 7;46(3):1952"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18589948", "10.1021/es702967k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
