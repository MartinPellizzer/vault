Gas exchange measurements on leaves and transmission electron micrographs of root nodule cells were made to detect any O<sub>3</sub> effects on the functioning of leaves and the root symbiont. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and internal CO<sub>2</sub> , concentration were calculated for all plants in clean O<sub>3</sub> -free air more than three weeks after the fumigations began. Significant positive correlations between photosynthesis and conductance were found for leaves of control nodulated and unnodulated alders and O<sub>3</sub> -treated nodulated alders. There was a weak positive correlation between photosynthesis and conductance for unnodulated O<sub>3</sub> -treated seedlings measured in clean air. When O<sub>3</sub> -treated leaves were measured during fumigation with O<sub>3</sub> , no positive correlation between photosynthesis and conductance was found for either nodulated or unnodulated seedlings. Photosynthetic rates of leaves having the highest stomatal conductance values were decreased by O<sub>3</sub> for both nodulated and unnodulated plants. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that after a 27 d exposure of shoots to O<sub>3</sub> , host root cells of nodules from O<sub>3</sub> -treated plants lacked organelles and showed extensive cytoplasmic breakdown. Hyphae and N<sub>2</sub> -fixing vesicles of Frankia appeared normal. The Frankia endophyte seems to be more resistant to O<sub>3</sub> than is the host root nodule cell. These results show that ambient levels of O<sub>3</sub> may reduce photosynthesis and bring about associated degradation in rhizosphere symbiosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, 97331-6505, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greitner", "ForeName": "Carol S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, 97331-6505, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winner", "ForeName": "William E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Becker, K.
