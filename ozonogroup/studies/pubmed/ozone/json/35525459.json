Catalytic ozonation is a quick and efficient technique to remove contaminants in aquatic environment. This study firstly developed a nanosheet-growth technique for synthesizing Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> with dot-sheet hierarchical structure as catalyst to ozonize antibiotics. Metronidazole could be totally removed through ozonation catalyzed by Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> in 10\u00a0min. Approximately 97% of metronidazole was eliminated in 10\u00a0min even the catalyst was used for 4 times. Reaction rate constant of Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> treatment was about 3.45 times that of nano-Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> treatment, illustrating that the dot-sheet hierarchical structure of Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> exhibited nano-confinement effect on the catalytic ozonation. Approximately 70.4% of metronidazole was mineralized by catalytic ozonation using Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C was more suitable for catalytic ozonation of metronidazole by Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Ions generally inhibited the catalytic ozonation of metronidazole while only 0.005\u00a0mol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> of Cl<sup>-</sup> slightly enhanced the ozonation rate, illustrating complicated mechanisms existed for ozonation of metronidazole catalyzed by Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The possible mechanisms of the ozonation of metronidazole using Li-doped Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> included direct ozonation and ozonation catalyzed by radical \u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, reactive oxygen species <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and intermediate (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The synthesized Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanosheet with dot-sheet hierarchical structure is a novel nanoconfined material with excellent reusability and catalytic performance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
