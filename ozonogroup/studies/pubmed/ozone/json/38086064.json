This study quantitatively investigates the influence of UVGI and ozone on the viability of<i>E. coli</i>in bioaerosols, with a particular focus on how<i>E. coli</i>viability depends on the size of the bioaerosols, a critical factor that determines deposition patterns within the human respiratory system and the evolution of bioaerosols in indoor environments. This study used a controlled small-scale laboratory chamber where<i>E. coli</i>suspensions were aerosolized and subjected to varying levels of UVGI and ozone levels throughout the exposure time (2-6 s). The normalized viability of<i>E. coli</i>was found to be significantly reduced by UVGI (60-240<i>\u03bc</i>W s cm<sup>-2</sup>) as the exposure time increased from 2 to 6 s, and the most substantial reduction of<i>E. coli</i>normalized viability was observed when UVGI and ozone (65-131 ppb) were used in combination. We also found that UVGI reduced the normalized viability of<i>E. coli</i>in bioaerosols more significantly with smaller sizes (0.25-0.5<i>\u03bc</i>m) than with larger sizes (0.5-2.5<i>\u03bc</i>m). However, when combining UVGI and ozone, the normalized viability was higher for smaller particle sizes than for the larger ones. The findings provide insights into the development of effective UVGI disinfection engineering methods to control the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in high-risk environments. By understanding the influence of the viability of microorganisms in various bioaerosol sizes, we can optimize UVGI and ozone techniques to reduce the potential risk of airborne transmission of pathogens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Creative Commons Attribution license."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Environmental and Materials Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33146, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Weixing", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO 65409, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yue-Wern", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0543-0443"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical, Environmental and Materials Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33146, United States of America."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38086064", "10.1088/1361-6528/ad14b4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
