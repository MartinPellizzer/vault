Occasionally, rare histological patterns are reported, including cystic or trabecular arrangements. We present a 47 year-old male patient with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent focused parathyroidectomy for a right inferior adenoma. Surgery was uneventful, but histologically, normal parathyroid tissue adjacent to a tumorous structure displaying a cystic growth pattern was detected. The cells lining the cyst walls appeared cylindrical and pseudo-stratified, vaguely reminiscent of a respiratory type of epithelium usually associated to branchial cleft cysts or thyroglossal cyst remnants, albeit with a tumorous appearance. The respiratory-like epithelium stained positive for parathyroid markers PTH and GATA3, thereby confirming them as parathyroid-derived. The patient was cured from surgery as he displayed normal calcium and PTH levels postoperatively, and is currently alive and well without signs of relapse 4 years after surgery. This is to our knowledge the first report of a parathyroid tumor displaying a respiratory-like epithelium. Experimentally, canine parathyroid glands can develop ciliated respiratory epithelium in response to inhalation of ozone. Our patient is a construction worker with a hypothetically increased risk of continuous ozone exposure. Although this association remains purely speculative, future investigations of this tumor phenotype could perhaps yield novel insights regarding the frequency of this histological variant, potential clinical associations, and clues regarding influencing factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Juhlin and Zedenius."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cytology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Juhlin", "ForeName": "C Christofer", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Breast, Endocrine Tumors and Sarcoma, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Zedenius", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)", "NlmUniqueID": "101555782", "ISSNLinking": "1664-2392"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathology", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Adenoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Parathyroid Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parathyroidectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sweden"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Juhlin CC, Erickson LA.
