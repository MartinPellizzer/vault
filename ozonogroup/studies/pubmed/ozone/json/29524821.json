It was found that the n-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/CNT composite exhibited the highest efficiency in oxalate degradation, though it performed the worst in the oxygen-reduction reaction for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. The n-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/CNT composite exhibited higher activity than CNT and other composites in catalytic ozonation experiments, due to the higher pyrrolic-N content modified on the CNT surface and higher surface area. It also has higher electron transfer ability, which benefited to the electro-reduction of both O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. The result confirmed that catalytic ozonation process was an important means to enhance the degradation efficiency in the electro-peroxone process, besides peroxone process and O<sub>3</sub>-electrolysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
