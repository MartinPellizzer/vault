Considering the possible mechanism of action and the same growth trend, the present study is designed to examine whether and how air pollutants, especially ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposure, are associated with the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). By a retrospective cohort, we analyzed the records of 45439 pregnant women from 2013 to 2018 and matched them to maternal exposure to O<sub>3</sub>. We found that the increased odds of GDM is associated with increased O<sub>3</sub> concentrations from the 1st month before pregnancy to the 3rd month during pregnancy. Specially, the odds ratios (ORs) of these associations were largest in the 1st month before pregnancy, suggesting that the effect of O<sub>3</sub> pollution on GDM occurred in pre-pregnancy period. Moreover, the exposure-response plot in the 1st month before pregnancy showed that the odds of GDM increased with the increasing concentration of O<sub>3</sub>. Our findings provide the evidence that O<sub>3</sub> exposure in both pre-pregnancy and pregnancy period elevates the odds of GDM, suggesting that more intensive air pollution controls are needed to improve the health of pregnant women and their offspring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
