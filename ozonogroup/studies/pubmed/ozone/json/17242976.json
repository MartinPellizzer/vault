One goal of this study was to determine the influence of precursor trace gases and local meteorology on concentrations of secondary aerosol ionic species. This paper describes the method details, shows the method is analytically valid, and reports overall as well as some specific results found during the field study. Two particulate air samples were collected per day onto quartz fiber filters at the Loyola University Chicago Air Station during the summer months in 2002-2004. In parallel, mixing ratios of ozone and nitrogen oxides were monitored and weather parameters were recorded. Particulates were extracted from the filter substrates and the subsequent solutions were analyzed by ion chromatography for anions, including low molecular weight organic acids, and cations. A washing procedure was implemented to reduce the high background values of the quartz fiber filters. Method validation showed that the collection method was efficient for all ions with exception of nitrate, whose efficiency of 70% indicated losses caused by volatilization. The extraction method also proved efficient for both field and laboratory samples, and the repeatability of the method was high with relative standard deviations less than 10% for all ions. Reproducibility of the results was determined by comparison of sulfate to sulfur analyzed by total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and proved to be high as well. Concentrations differed significantly between the three summer studies due to varying levels of precursor species as a consequence of distinct temperatures and wind direction profiles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry, Loyola University Chicago, 6525 N.
