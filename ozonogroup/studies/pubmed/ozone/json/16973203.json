The results showed that the combination of ozonation and sonolysis was a highly effective way to remove color from waste water. The operational parameters, namely concentration of the dye, pH, ozone dose and ultrasonic density, were investigated during the process. The decolorization of the dye followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Increasing the initial concentration of Direct Red 23 led to a decreasing rate constant. The optimum pH for the reaction was 8.0, and both lower and higher pH decreased the removal rate. The effect of the ozone dose on the dye decolorization was much greater than that of the sonolysis density. Intermediates such as naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, 1-naphthol, urea and acetamide were detected by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in the absence of pH buffer, while nitrate and sulfate ions and formic, acetic and oxalic acids were detected by ion chromatography. A tentative degradation pathway was proposed without any further quantitative analyses. During the degradation, all nitrogen atoms and phenyl groups of Direct Red 23 were degraded into urea, nitrate ion, nitrogen and formic, acetic and oxalic acids, etc."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China. ss@zjut.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Haiping", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhiqiao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianmeng", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sonication"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16973203", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.07.090", "S0045-6535(06)01061-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
