Nitrate formation during ozonation was compared to the changes in UV absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UVA<sub>254</sub>) including the effect of pH. For low specific ozone doses UVA<sub>254</sub> was abated more efficiently than nitrate was formed. This is due to a relatively slow rate-limiting step for nitrate formation from the reaction between ozone and a proposed nitrogen-containing intermediate. This reaction cannot compete with the fast reactions between ozone and UV-absorbing moieties (e.g., activated aromatic compounds). To further test the kinetics of nitrate formation, two possible intermediates formed during ozonation of DON were tested. At pH 7, nitrate was formed during ozonation of acetone oxime and methyl nitroacetate with second-order rate constants of 256.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and 149.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The abatement of the selected micropollutants (i.e., 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2), carbamazepine (CBZ), bezafibrate (BZF), ibuprofen (IBU), and p-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA)) was investigated for specific ozone doses \u22641.53\u00a0mgO<sub>3</sub>/mgDOC and its efficiency depended strongly on the reactivity of the selected compounds with ozone. The relative abatement of micropollutants (i.e., EE2 and CBZ) with high ozone reactivity showed linear relationships with nitrate formation. The abatement of micropollutants with intermediate-low ozone reactivity (BZF, IBU, and pCBA) followed one- and two-phase behaviors relative to nitrate formation during ozonation of water samples containing high and low concentrations of nitrate-forming DON, respectively. During ozonation of a wastewater sample, the N-nitrosodimethylamine formation potential (NDMA-FP) during chloramination decreased with increasing specific ozone doses. A good correlation was obtained between NDMA-FP abatement and nitrate formation. Therefore, nitrate formation after pre-ozonation may be a useful parameter to estimate the reduction of the NDMA-FP during post-chloramination. Overall, the results of this study suggest that nitrate formation (possibly in combination with UVA<sub>254</sub> abatement) during ozonation of DON-containing waters may be a good surrogate for assessing the abatement of micropollutants and the NDMA-FP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
