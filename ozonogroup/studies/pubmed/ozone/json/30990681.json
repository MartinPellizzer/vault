These measurements were then analyzed using a box model to quantify the rates of major processes that transformed the composition of the air. VOC emission factors were quantified for museum occupants and their activities. The deposition of VOCs to surfaces was quantified across a range of VOC saturation vapor concentrations ( C*) and Henry's Law constants ( H) and determined to be a major sink for VOCs with C* < 10<sup>8</sup> \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> and H > 10<sup>2</sup> M atm<sup>-1</sup>. The reaction rates of VOCs with O<sub>3</sub>, OH radicals, and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) radicals were quantified, with unsaturated and saturated VOCs having oxidation lifetimes of >5 and >15 h, making deposition to surfaces and ventilation the dominant VOC sinks in the museum. O<sub>3</sub> loss rates were quantified inside a museum gallery, where reactions with surfaces, NO, occupants, and NO<sub>2</sub> accounted for 62%, 31%, 5%, and 2% of the O<sub>3</sub> sink. The measured concentrations of acetic acid, formic acid, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and total VOCs were below the guidelines for museums."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0441-2614"], "LastName": "Pagonis", "ForeName": "Demetrios", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "Derek J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Algrim", "ForeName": "Lucas B", "Initials": "LB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-3213-4233"], "LastName": "Day", "ForeName": "Douglas A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Handschy", "ForeName": "Anne V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aerodyne Research, Inc. , Billerica , Massachusetts 01821 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stark", "ForeName": "Harald", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Shelly L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0385-1826"], "LastName": "de Gouw", "ForeName": "Joost", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6203-1847"], "LastName": "Jimenez", "ForeName": "Jose L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7419-0044"], "LastName": "Ziemann", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Museums"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Universities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30990681", "10.1021/acs.est.9b00276"]}}]}
