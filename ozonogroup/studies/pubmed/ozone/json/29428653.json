The effects of the organic loading rate (OLR), and etodolac and sulfate concentrations on the acidification rate and microbial community in AnSBR were investigated at 35\u202f\u00b0C with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 37\u202fh, a pH of 5, and OLRs up to 5.2 kgCOD/m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7day. The AnSBR accomplished a 60% acidification ratio and 50-60% etodolac removal at OLRs up to 2.6 kgCOD/m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7day. However, at OLR\u202f=\u202f3.9 kgCOD/m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7day, acidification was not achieved due to sulfite inhibition; pre-ozonation was applied to overcome this sulfite inhibition. Although etodolac and COD removals were improved, the wastewater was not successfully acidified. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that acidification was inhibited by the dominance of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) over acidification bacteria in the AnSBR. However, increasing the OLR to 5.2 kgCOD/m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7day led to toxicity stress in the SRB due to increased sulfite concentrations. Sulfate load fundamentally affected acidification process and microbial community composition. The presence of etodolac with concentration up to 56\u202fmg/L did not have a significant effect on VFA production and the microbial community."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
