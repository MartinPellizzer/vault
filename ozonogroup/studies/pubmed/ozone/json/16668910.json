IR-36 and Fujiyama-5 were grown at ambient (360 microbars) and elevated CO(2) (660 microbars) from germination through reproduction in unshaded greenhouses at the Duke University Phytotron. Growth at elevated CO(2) resulted in significant decreases in nighttime respiration and increases in photosynthesis, total biomass, and yield for both cultivars. However, in plants exposed to simultaneous increases in CO(2) and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, CO(2) enhancement effects on respiration, photosynthesis, and biomass were eliminated in IR-36 and significantly reduced in Fujiyama-5. UV-B radiation simulated a 25% depletion in stratospheric ozone at Durham, North Carolina. Analysis of the response of CO(2) uptake to internal CO(2) concentration at light saturation suggested that, for IR-36, the predominant limitation to photosynthesis with increased UV-B radiation was the capacity for regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), whereas for Fujiyama-5 the primary photosynthetic decrease appeared to be related to a decline in apparent carboxylation efficiency. Changes in the RuBP regeneration limitation in IR-36 were consistent with damage to the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II as estimated from the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence. Little change in RuBP regeneration and photochemistry was evident in cultivar Fujiyama-5, however. The degree of sensitivity of photochemical reactions with increased UV-B radiation appeared to be related to leaf production of UV-B-absorbing compounds. Fujiyama-5 had a higher concentration of these compounds than IR-36 in all environments, and the production of these compounds in Fujiyama-5 was stimulated by UV-B fluence. Results from this study suggest that in rice alterations in growth or photosynthesis as a result of enhanced CO(2) may be eliminated or reduced if UV-B radiation continues to increase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziska", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teramura", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Mar;74(3):475-80", "ArticleIdList": ["16663447"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Jan;92(1):141-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16667236"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Oct;94(2):470-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16667735"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 Oct;60(4):606-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16660147"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Jun;96(2):627-34", "ArticleIdList": ["16668232"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Feb;92(2):487-94", "ArticleIdList": ["16667302"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Feb;89(2):590-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16666587"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1985 Jul;78(3):619-22", "ArticleIdList": ["16664293"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16668910", "PMC1080487", "10.1104/pp.99.2.473"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
