Plants 8 weeks of age were subjected to different ozone levels ranging from 0 to 134 nl liter(-1) for exposure periods up to 16 days. Leaves were analyzed for concentration of soluble carbohydrates, starch, free amino acids, soluble protein, total phenolics, and total cardenolides. Significant interactions between the linear effects of ozone concentration and exposure time were found for soluble carbohydrates, amino acids, cardenolides and phenolics. No significant treatment effects could be observed on foliar starch and protein concentration. The metabolic responses of plants to fumigation appeared to be altered by overall plant nutrition. It is possible that the metabolic changes observed in the host plant represent important changes in nutritional quality to insects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, Tower Road, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bolsinger", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lier", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lansky", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092115", "10.1016/0269-7491(91)90156-q", "026974919190156Q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
