Total anthocyanin contents and organic acid profiles were significantly affected by storage times. Malic acid (MA) was the main organic acid in \"Angelino\" plums. MA content (4663 and 4764\u2005mg/L) was the highest value in the ozonated 2-ppm/9-min and 5-ppm/3-min than other ozonated groups and also control at 120 days of the storage. The ozone treatments especially 2-ppm/9-min and 5-ppm/3\u2005min can significantly retard the degradation of MA content (8294 to 2688-2694\u2005mg/L) during the storage (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.05). Total phenol content were most significantly decreased in the control during storage, with the loss at the level of 31.7% of TPs, while the lowest one 2-ppm/9-min (20.8%) and 5-ppm/-3\u2005min (21.9%). The color and texture are maintained for the ozone applications compared to the control during storage. Ozonation with 2-ppm/9-min and 5-ppm/-3\u2005min showed the best performance while maintaining the storage stability based on the physicochemical properties including hardness and bioactive compounds (such as anthocyanins and organic acids), visual appearance due to the more attractive color (L*, a*, b*) the plums."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8293-7301"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Canakkale, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Caner", "ForeName": "Cengiz", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Canakkale, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Pala", "ForeName": "\u00c7i\u011fdem Uysal", "Initials": "\u00c7U"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6709-1347"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Processing, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Canakkale, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Y\u00fcceer", "ForeName": "Muhammed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Food Sci Technol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9889534", "ISSNLinking": "1082-0132"}, "CoiStatement": "DECLARATION OF CONFLICTING INTERESTSThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39034107", "10.1177/10820132241263198"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
