Many countries have planned to reach carbon neutrality by the mid-21st century. In this study, the impacts of global and regional SST changes on near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China in the middle of the 21st century under the carbon-neutral scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-1.9), compared with the high-emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5), and possible physical and chemical mechanisms are investigated using the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). Under future climate change, the changes in SSTs in the carbon-neutral scenario relative to the high-emission scenario lead to a dipole change in near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in eastern and western China, with a significant decrease of 0.79 ppbv in the eastern China and a significant increase of 1.05 ppbv in the western China. The cooling of North Pacific Ocean under the carbon-neutral scenario causes a decrease in near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 0.48 ppbv in eastern China due to the weakened chemical production and an increase by 0.74 ppbv in western China attributed to the enhanced O<sub>3</sub> transport from Eurasia. Cooling of Southern Hemisphere oceans leads to anomalous upward air motions over eastern China, which weaken the vertical transport of high-elevation O<sub>3</sub> to the surface, resulting in a reduction in near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 0.58 ppbv in eastern China. Our results suggest that future changes in SSTs in the carbon-neutral scenario will positively benefit O<sub>3</sub> air quality improvement in the polluted eastern China, with the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere oceans playing important roles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
