Particle transmission of the denuder was studied, and over 99% of particles ranging from 10 to 2,500 nm were transmitted. The device, containing 4.66 g of ionic liquid, was used outdoors, under dry and damp atmospheric conditions. In order to expose the device to an average concentration of 120 ppbv (240 microg m(-3)) of ozone in air, an additional production of ozone was directly injected into the denuder. Under these conditions, over 97% of ozone was removed for approximately 120 h (5 days). Therefore, iodide-based ionic liquids can be used as a new alternative to conventional denuder coatings in order to reduce artifacts occurring during sampling of particulate matter. Future applications are not limited to ozone removal for specific aerosol sampling methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire Chimie Mol\u00e9culaire Environnement (LCME-Polytech'Savoie), Universit\u00e9 de Savoie, Campus de Savoie Technolac, 73376 Le Bourget du Lac, France. alexandre.albinet@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Albinet", "ForeName": "Alexandre", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Papaiconomou", "ForeName": "Nicolas", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Estager", "ForeName": "Julien", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suptil", "ForeName": "Jo\u00ebl", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Draye", "ForeName": "Micheline", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Besombes", "ForeName": "Jean-Luc", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Anal Bioanal Chem. 2010 May;397(2):887", "Note": "Draye, Micheline [added]"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19902189", "10.1007/s00216-009-3243-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
