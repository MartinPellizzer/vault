To detect the stratospheric aerosol layer, a 1064\u2005nm lidar with high resolution and large dynamic range is developed using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD). Measurements are typically performed at 1064\u2005nm for its sensitivity to aerosol, whereas detectors are limited by low efficiency and high dark count rate (DCR). SNSPDs are characterized by high efficiency in the infrared wavelength domain, as well as low noise and dead time, which can significantly enhance the signal quality. However, it is still challenging to build an SNSPD with both large active area and high count rate. To improve the maximal count rate (MCR) so as to avoid saturation in the near range, a 16-pixel interleaved SNSPD array and a multichannel data acquisition system are developed. As a reference, a synchronous system working at 532\u2005nm is applied. In a continuous comparison experiment, backscatter ratio profiles are retrieved with resolutions of 90 m/3 min, and the 1064\u2005nm system shows better performance, which is sensitive to aerosols and immune to the contamination of the ozone absorption and density of molecule change in the lower stratosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Manyi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yunbin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Jinlong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lijie", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Dawei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Haiyun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Xiankang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101137103", "ISSNLinking": "1094-4087"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "25"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36785283", "10.1364/OE.475124", "525079"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
