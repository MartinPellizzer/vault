High quality and safety of products are equally important factors in the food industry. They may be achieved with several, more or less technologically advanced methodologies. In this work, we review the role, contribution, importance, and impact of ozone as a decontaminating agent used to control and eliminate the presence of microorganisms in food products as well as to extend their shelf-life and remove undesirable odors. Several researchers have been focusing on the ozone's properties and applications, proving that ozone treatment technology can be applied to all types of foods, from fruits, vegetables, spices, meat, and seafood products to beverages. A compilation of those works, presented in this review, can be a useful tool for establishing appropriate ozone treatment conditions, and factors affecting the improved quality and safety of food products. A critical evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of ozone in the context of its application in the food industry is presented as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of General Food Chemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Sciences , Lodz University of Technology , Lodz , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brodowska", "ForeName": "Agnieszka Joanna", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Fermentation Technology and Microbiology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Sciences , Lodz University of Technology , Lodz , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nowak", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of General Food Chemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Sciences , Lodz University of Technology , Lodz , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "\u015amigielski", "ForeName": "Krzysztof", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28394634", "10.1080/10408398.2017.1308313"]}}]}
