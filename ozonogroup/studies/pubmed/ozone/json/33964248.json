In preclinical studies or human clinical trials, NTP promotes blood coagulation, eradication of bacterial, viral and biofilm-related infections, wound healing, and cancer cell death. To elucidate the solution-phase biological effects of NTP in the presence of biocompatible reducing agents, we employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to quantify <sup>\u25cf</sup>OH using a spin-trapping probe, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO); <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> using a fluorescent probe; and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u25cf-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> using luminescent probes in the presence of thiols or tempol. NTP-induced <sup>\u25cf</sup>OH was significantly scavenged by dithiothreitol (DTT), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in 2 or 5\u00a0mM DMPO. NTP-induced O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u25cf-</sup> was significantly scavenged by 10\u00a0\u03bcM DTT and GSH, while <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> was not efficiently scavenged by these compounds. GSSG degraded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> more effectively than GSH and DTT, suggesting that the disulfide bonds reacted with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the presence of 1-50\u00a0mM DMPO, NTP-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> quantities were unchanged. The inhibitory effect of tempol concentration (50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcM) on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was observed in 1 and 10\u00a0mM DMPO, whereas it became ineffective in 50\u00a0mM DMPO. Furthermore, DMPO-OH did not interact with tempol. These results suggest that DMPO and tempol react competitively with O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u25cf-</sup>. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the interaction between NTP-induced ROS and biomolecules."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
