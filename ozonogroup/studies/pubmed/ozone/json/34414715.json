This study uses real-time O<sub>3</sub> and meteorological data, obtained in 337 cities in China during the warm seasons (April to September) of 2015 to 2018, to determine the spatial variation of surface O<sub>3</sub> and its meteorological driving factors in major cities in China, via trend analysis, spatial autocorrelation, hotspot analysis, and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) modeling. The results show that: \u2460 during the warm season, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations showed a significant growth trend (<i>P</i><0.05), with an average growth rate of 0.28 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, while more than 55% of urban O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased by 0.50 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> annually. \u2461 There were significant regional differences in O<sub>3</sub> concentration. High values (>60 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) were distributed over east China, north China, central China, and northwest China, while low values (<20 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) were distributed over south China and southwest China. \u2462 The spatial agglomeration of O<sub>3</sub> concentration has been enhanced year by year, with hotspots mainly distributed over east China and central China. In contrast, there are cold spots in northeast China, southwest China, and southern China. \u2463Analysis of the MGWR model indicated that temperature, wind speed, cloud coverage, and precipitation all have a significant effect on the distribution of O<sub>3</sub>, although there are also discrepancies in driving factor priorities between the different regions. Temperature was the main meteorological driving factor of O<sub>3</sub> variation during the warm season in China, and its impact on O<sub>3</sub> concentration was significantly higher in north China, northwest China, and northeast China than in other regions; overall, there was a significant positive correlation between O<sub>3</sub> concentration and temperature, except in Guangxi, Yunnan, and Jiangxi. O<sub>3</sub> concentration was negatively correlated with wind speed in most regions of south China, east China, and central China, and positively correlated with wind speed in north China and northeast China. O<sub>3</sub> concentration was significantly negatively correlated with cloud cover, except in Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei, Gansu, Guangdong, and some areas in southwest China. O<sub>3</sub> concentration was significantly negatively correlated with precipitation, except in the northwest and southwest regions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dan-Lu", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Resources, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin 541006, China."}], "LastName": "Di", "ForeName": "Yan-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Zhi-Xiang", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Jia-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Ke", "ForeName": "Bi-Qin", "Initials": "BQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Ya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34414715", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202009228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
