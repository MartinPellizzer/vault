At the end of one growing season, height and diameter growth of seedlings exposed to twice-ambient O(3) were not statistically different from those of seedlings exposed to subambient O(3). Biomass of all plant parts was reduced by 7 to 16% in response to increasing O(3) concentration. No statistically significant growth responses to rain chemistry or soil magnesium status were observed, and there were no statistically significant interactive treatment effects. Needle pigment concentrations were not significantly affected by rain chemistry or soil Mg status and there were no visible signs of injury to needles that could be attributed to O(3) stress or Mg deficiency. Concentrations of chlorophyll a and b, and carotenes were 23, 30 and 21% higher (P </= 0.05) respectively, in seedlings exposed to twice-ambient O(3) than in seedlings from the other ozone treatments. There were no interactive treatment effects on needle pigment concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "N T", "Initials": "NT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simmons", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14972964", "10.1093/treephys/6.1.95"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
