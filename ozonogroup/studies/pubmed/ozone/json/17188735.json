A pair of nitrifying sequencing batch reactors was operated in either aerobic or alternating anoxic/aerobic conditions, with one control and one ozonated reactor in each set. The amount of solids produced decreased with the ozone dose. Biomass in the anoxic/aerobic reactor was easier to destroy (up to 25% of the initial excess sludge) than in the aerobic (10%) one, generating approximately twice as much soluble COD by cell lysis. Denitrification rate improved up to 60% due to additional carbon released by ozonation. Nitrification rates deteriorated much more in the aerobic than in the alternating reactor, possibly as a result of direct destruction of nitrifying autotrophs as well as competition created by growth of heterotrophs receiving the additional COD. Overall, ozonation provided the expected benefits in denitrification and had less impact on nitrification in the alternating reactors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada MB R3T 5V6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dytczak", "ForeName": "Magdalena A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Londry", "ForeName": "Kathleen L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siegrist", "ForeName": "Hansruedi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oleszkiewicz", "ForeName": "Jan A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17188735", "10.1016/j.watres.2006.11.009", "S0043-1354(06)00625-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
