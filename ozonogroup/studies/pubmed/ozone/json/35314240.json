The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is considered to be a global atmospheric background location with limited anthropogenic influences. However, the observed summertime surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration on the TP is 25% higher than that in highly polluted regions (e.g., southern China). Previous studies have suggested that lightning-produced NO<sub>x</sub> (LNO<sub>x</sub>) can affect the concentration of surface O<sub>3</sub>. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model combined with satellite, ground-based, and airborne observations to evaluate the contribution of LNO<sub>x</sub> to the surface O<sub>3</sub> budget on the TP. Our results showed that LNO<sub>x</sub> contributed approximately 15% of the surface NO<sub>x</sub> emission on the TP in summer. Accordingly, the contribution of LNO<sub>x</sub> to the summertime surface daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> on the TP was 9.3 \u00b1 7.1 ppb, which was 17.5% \u00b1 14.5% of the total concentration of the surface MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>. In addition, our study found that the number of moles of NO produced per lightning flash (LNO<sub>x</sub> production efficiency) significantly affected the surface concentration of NO<sub>x</sub>, OH, and MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>. Increasing the LNO<sub>x</sub> production efficiency (PE) from 0 to 330 mol NO flash<sup>-1</sup> increased the concentration of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> by up to 20% on the TP. Our study revealed that lightning significantly affects the atmospheric chemical processes involving O<sub>3</sub> on the TP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
