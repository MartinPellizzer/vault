The US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 micrograms/l for bromate in public drinking water. Should the proposed MCL for bromate become final, it may then be considered for adoption as a bottled water quality standard by the US Food and Drug Administration. This paper reports the development of a gas chromatographic/ mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method for the determination of parts-per-billion (microgram/l) levels of bromate (BrO3-) in bottled water. The GC/MS method was validated by using distilled and deionized Milli-Q water; detection limits, quantitation limits, and recoveries were determined and identities were confirmed by MS on the basis of analyses of test portions fortified with BrO3- at 0.8, 3.8, 7.7, 15, and 46 micrograms/l. The method also was evaluated on the basis of recoveries determined for two commercial brands of bottled water fortified with BrO3- at 3.8 and 7.7 micrograms/l and two commercial brands fortified at 0.8, 3.8, and 7.7 micrograms/l. For the Milli-Q water, recoveries ranged from 100 to 121%; for the fortified commercial products, recoveries ranged from 87 to 115%. The limits of detection and quantitation were determined to be 0.4 and 0.7 microgram/l, respectively. Several commercial brands of bottled water were analysed, and BrO3- was found in these products at levels ranging from none to 38 micrograms/l."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Product Manufacture and Use, US Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC 20204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nyman", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Canas", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joe", "ForeName": "F L", "Initials": "FL", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diachenko", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam", "NlmUniqueID": "8500474", "ISSNLinking": "0265-203X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8871119", "10.1080/02652039609374447"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
