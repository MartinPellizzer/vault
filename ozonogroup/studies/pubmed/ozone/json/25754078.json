The impact of UV radiation and carbaryl singly and in combination on Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Brassica rapa (turnip) was studied. The combined exposure was analyzed using the MixTox tool and was based on the conceptual model of independent action, where possible deviations to synergism or antagonism and dose-ratio or dose-level response pattern were also considered. Compared with the control, carbaryl and UV radiation individually led to reductions in growth, fresh and dry weight, and water content for both species. Combined treatment of UV and carbaryl was more deleterious compared with single exposure. For T. aestivum length, no interaction between the 2 stressors was found (independent action), and a dose-level deviation was the best description for the weight parameters. For B. rapa, dose-ratio deviations from the conceptual model were found when length and dry weight were analyzed, and a higher than expected effect on the fresh weight (synergism) occurred with combined exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 SETAC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and CESAM-Centre for Marine and Environmental Studies, Aveiro University, Aveiro, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Lima", "ForeName": "Maria P R", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and CESAM-Centre for Marine and Environmental Studies, Aveiro University, Aveiro, Portugal."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Plant Production, Federal University of Tocantins, Gurupi-Tocantins, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Amadeu M V M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and CESAM-Centre for Marine and Environmental Studies, Aveiro University, Aveiro, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Loureiro", "ForeName": "Susana", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "8308958", "ISSNLinking": "0730-7268"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R890C8J3N1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbaryl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica napus"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbaryl"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25754078", "10.1002/etc.2971"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
