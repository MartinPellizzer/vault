Despite an increasing number of evidence that O3-AHT is safe, this type of therapy remains controversial. To extend knowledge about the changes in blood evoked by O3-AHT, LC-MS- and GC-MS-based metabolic fingerprinting was used to compare plasma samples obtained from blood before and after the treatment with potentially therapeutic concentrations of ozone. The procedure was performed in PVC bags utilized for blood storage to study also possible interactions between ozone and plastic. By use of GC-MS, an increase in lactic acid and pyruvic acid was observed, which indicated an increased rate of glycolysis. With LC-MS, changes in plasma antioxidants were observed. Moreover, concentrations of lipid oxidation products (LOP) and lysophospholipids were increased after ozone treatment. This is the first report of increased LOPs metabolites after ozonation of blood. Seven metabolites detected by LC-QTOF-MS only in ozonated samples could be considered as novel biomarkers of oxidative stress. Several plasticizers have been detected by both techniques in blood stored in PVC bags. PVC is known to be an ozone resistant material, but ozonation of blood in PVC bags stimulates leaching of plasticizers into the blood."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Medical University of Bialystok, Kilinskiego 1, 15-089 Bialystok, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ciborowski", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lipska", "ForeName": "Alina", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godzien", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrarini", "ForeName": "Alessia", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korsak", "ForeName": "Jolanta", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radziwon", "ForeName": "Piotr", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomasiak", "ForeName": "Marian", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbas", "ForeName": "Coral", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Proteome Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101128775", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysophospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8558G7RUTR", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-86-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyl Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lysophospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyl Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23148940", "10.1021/pr3008946"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
