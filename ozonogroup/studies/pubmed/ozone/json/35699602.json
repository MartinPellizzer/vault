The data from extensive monitoring of the growth of peat moss Sphagnum riparium, which we are conducting in the mires of Karelia (Russia), may shed light on this issue. During the 6\u2009years of observation, 161,190 shoots were measured, and 1075 growth rates were obtained. Considering together the growth rates with the sunspot number and involving data on seasonal temperature, we found previously unknown effects of daily-scale solar activity on plant growth. It was found that the sunspot number weakly but significantly inhibits the growth of Sphagnum. The extreme sunspot number in the 4\u2009days before the growth rate values have a stronger influence. The involvement of temperature data showed that inhibition in growth is observed only in the temperature range from 6.7\u00b0C to 15.3\u00b0C and disappears beyond these limits. In addition, the data obtained showed that the influence of sunspot number on the growth of Sphagnum is progressively increasing along the gradient from the minimum to the maximum of the 11-year solar cycle. The study provides one of the first results on the effect of solar activity on plant growth on a daily scale. The results expand our knowledge of the biological effects of solar activity. Indirectly, they can also be useful to better our understanding of the ozone layer's involvement in this process."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7999-0128"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biology of the Karelian Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Petrozavodsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Mironov", "ForeName": "Victor L", "Initials": "VL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "122031700449-3", "Agency": "State ordered research project of the Karelian Research Centre RAS (Institute of Biology)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Russia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solar Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Sphagnopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Brown, B.A., Headland, L.R. & Jenkins, G.I.
