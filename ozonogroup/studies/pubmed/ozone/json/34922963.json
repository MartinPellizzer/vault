In the present study, a series of experiments were designed to study the individual and interactive influences of O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation on the biomass yield, variation in different leaf types, distribution of cadmium (Cd) in various tissues, and phytoremediation efficiency of Festuca arundinacea using open top chambers. The results found that an elevated O<sub>3</sub> content of 80\u00a0ppb, a potential O<sub>3</sub> content predicted for 2050, decreased the total dry mass of F. arundinacea and increased the proportion of falling leaf tissues of the species significantly. Under the same ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels, O<sub>3</sub> fumigation increased the Cd concentrations in the roots and the fresh, mature, senescent, and dead leaf tissues by 27.8%, 133.3%, 94.4%, 125.3%, and 48.6%, respectively. An elevated CO<sub>2</sub> content (550\u00a0ppm) promoted the biomass yield of F. arundinacea, particularly in the falling leaf tissues. The results of the combined O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> treatment showed that CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation alleviated the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on plant growth and increased the accumulation capacity in different plant tissues. Significantly more Cd was accumulated in senescent and dead leaves under the synergistic action of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, suggesting that the phytoremediation effect on F. arundinacea using the falling leaves harvesting method could be improved under the future atmospheric environment of high CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
