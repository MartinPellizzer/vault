Many non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) are efficient O<sub>3</sub> precursors. In this study, target volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including oxygenated VOCs (known as carbonyls), were monitored at eight sampling sites distributed in urban and suburban in the typical and industrial-dominant city of Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, China. At the suburban sites, C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>12</sub> alkanes, aromatics with lower reactivity (k<sub>OH</sub> <13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-12</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and acetonitrile were more abundant than urban ones due to higher emissions from diesel-fueled trucks and biomass burning. In general, higher abundances of total quantified NMHCs (\u03a3NMHC) were found on high O<sub>3</sub> (HO) days. The increments of formaldehyde (C<sub>1</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> were higher in urban than suburban, while a reverse trend was seen for acetaldehyde (C<sub>2</sub>). Substantial and local biogenic inputs of C<sub>2</sub> were found in suburban in the afternoon when both temperature and light intensity reached maximum of the day. In urban, higher increment was found for O<sub>3</sub> than the carbonyls, representing that the secondary formation of O<sub>3</sub> was more efficient. Distance decay gradient of most representative NMHCs were positively correlated to the distances from a westernmost industrial origin located at the upwind location. The net loss rates of the NMHCs ranged from\u00a0-0.009 to\u00a0-0.11\u00a0ppbv\u00a0km<sup>-1</sup>, while the higher rates were seen for the most reactive species like C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkenes. The results and interpretation of this study are informative to establish efficient local control measures for O<sub>3</sub> and the related percussors for the microscale industrial cities in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
