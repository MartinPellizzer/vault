Evidence for integrating the environmental burden and socio-economic profit is lacking. This study quantifies the yield performance, environmental burden (in terms of seven mid-point environmental impact categories, especially for the global warming potential (GWP) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions), and economic benefits among different intensive farming systems with varying agricultural resource input in maize (Zea mays) production. The results showed that seed yields increased with increasing resource inputs under intensive farming systems. Meanwhile, environmental burden in terms of GWP and integrated environmental impacts (IEI) based on per unit grain yield produced increased substantially with increasing resource inputs. The conventional planting accomplished the worst environmental performance (represented by the highest IEI), which was mainly attributed to higher agricultural resource input (such as fertilizer and diesel fuel consumption) per unit of grain yield produced, and thereby increased GWP, abiotic depletion-elements (Ade), ozone layer depletion (ODP), photochemical oxidation (PO), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) by 22 %, 30 %, 36 %, 25 %, 32 % and 35 %, respectively. The relatively lower resource input under intensive farming coupled with water-saving technology could be highly recommended to local farmers; while extreme resource input planting patterns were not endorsed because of the yield penalty, low net revenue and high environmental burden. This study highlights the importance of an appropriate use of agricultural resources and innovative water-saving technology for mitigating environmental perils and ensuring global food supplies under intensive farming systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
