To contribute to the establishment of a generalized spectral approach for vegetation stress detection, this study compares the ability of high-spectral-resolution reflectance (R) and fluorescence (F) foliar measurements to detect vegetation changes associated with common environmental factors affecting plant growth and productivity. To obtain a spectral dataset from a broad range of species and stress conditions, plant material from three experiments was examined, including (i) corn, nitrogen (N) deficiency/excess; (ii) soybean, elevated carbon dioxide, and ozone levels; and (iii) red maple, augmented ultraviolet irradiation. Fluorescence and R spectra (400-800 nm) were measured on the same foliar samples in conjunction with photosynthetic pigments, carbon, and N content. For separation of a wide range of treatment levels, hyperspectral (5-10 nm) R indices were superior compared with F or broadband R indices, with the derivative parameters providing optimal results. For the detection of changes in vegetation physiology, hyperspectral indices can provide a significant improvement over broadband indices. The relationship of treatment levels to R was linear, whereas that to F was curvilinear. Using reflectance measurements, it was not possible to identify the unstressed vegetation condition, which was accomplished in all three experiments using F indices. Large-scale monitoring of vegetation condition and the detection of vegetation stress could be improved by using hyperspectral R and F information, a possible strategy for future remote sensing missions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology, Univ. of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), Baltimore, MD 20771, USA. pcampbel@pop900.gsfc.nasa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "P K E", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Middleton", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McMurtrey", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Corp", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chappelle", "ForeName": "E W", "Initials": "EW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Qual", "NlmUniqueID": "0330666", "ISSNLinking": "0047-2425"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acer"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17485715", "10.2134/jeq2005.0396", "36/3/832"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
