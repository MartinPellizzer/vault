It has been detected in effluents of wastewater plant treatments, sewage sludge, hospital wastewaters, surface waters, and drinking water due to its continuous release to the environment, mainly from the excretion in the urine of animals and humans. IBP is a carcinogenic and non-steroidal endocrine disrupting drug with harmful effects over fungal, bacterial, algae, microorganisms, crustacean, and fish species, and can be potentially hazard for human health. Since conventional treatments remove inefficiently this drug, many advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed aiming their abatement from waters to avoid their harmful health problems. This paper presents an exhaustive and critical review on the application of AOPs to treat synthetic waters, natural waters, and real wastewaters polluted with IBP alone or mixed with other common drugs covering up to 2020. The characteristics and main results obtained for single, hybrid, and sequential treatments are described. Dielectric barrier or pulsed-corona discharges are detailed among the single processes. Hybrid processes such as photocatalysis (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, UV/chlorine, TiO<sub>2</sub>/UV), hybrid ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, electro-peroxone, catalytic ozonation), Fenton-based processes (photo-Fenton, electro-Fenton, photoelectro-Fenton), zero-valent iron, ultrasonic, peroxymonosulfate, and persulfate, are discussed. The effect of the kind of irradiation (UV, visible, solar) on photo-assisted processes is analyzed. Sequential processes with biological pre- or post-treatments using or not membranes for natural water and real wastewater remediation are described. Finally, 38 by-products detected during IBP removal by AOPs are reported, allowing envisaging three parallel pathways for its initial degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
