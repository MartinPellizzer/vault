In this paper, a green deep eutectic solvent (DES) based on ethylene glycol (EG) and choline chloride (CC), combined with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from air source, realized highly selective leaching Li from LiFePO<sub>4</sub> in situ for the first time. The influence of experimental parameters on Li and Fe leaching efficiencies (\u03b7<sub>Li</sub>, \u03b7<sub>Fe</sub>) were studied by orthogonal and single-factor tests, and \u03b7<sub>Li</sub>\u00a0\u2265\u00a092.2% while \u03b7<sub>Fe</sub>\u00a0\u2264\u00a01.6% were obtained under the optimal conditions (6\u00a0h, 20\u00a0g/L, 8EG:1CC, 40\u00a0\u00b0C). The impurity Fe in the filtrate was completely precipitated as amorphous FePO<sub>4</sub>\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O after heating (150\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.5\u00a0h), achieving a pure Li-solution. The leaching mechanism elucidated that the synergistic effect (acidification, replacement and oxidation reaction) between the DES and O<sub>3</sub> determined the phase transition of Li and Fe, promoting the efficient selective extraction of Li and in-situ separation of Fe (FePO<sub>4</sub>). The average \u03b7<sub>Li</sub> and \u03b7<sub>Fe</sub> were separately 85.4% and 2.0% after ten cycles of the 8EG:1CC, indicative of its' excellent reusability. Meanwhile, LiCl was recovered from the filtrate. This process avoided the use of strong acid/alkali and discharge of waste water, providing fresh perspectives on the green recovery of spent LiFePO<sub>4</sub> batteries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
