The ranking of VOC mixing ratios was methanol (32.72\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.94\u202fppb)\u202f>\u202facetaldehyde (5.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.4\u202fppb)\u202f>\u202facetic acid (3.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.71\u202fppb). Lanzhou has higher oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) mixing ratios (methanol and acetaldehyde) and lower aromatics levels (benzene, toluene and C8-aromatics) compared with other cities. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model showed eight sources of VOCs as follows: (1) mixed industrial process-1 (13.5%), (2) secondary formation (13.2%), (3) mixed industrial process-2 (11.8%), (4) residential biofuel use and waste disposal (13.80%), (5) solvent usage (10.1%), (6) vehicular exhaust (11.8%), (7) biogenic (13.8%) and (8) biomass burning (12.0%). Both the PSCF and the CWT results of mixed industrial process-1 were mainly from the northeast of Lanzhou and the biomass burning was from the southeast; the other four sources (without secondary formation and biogenic) were mainly from the west and northwest of Lanzhou, which were associated with the dust area of the Gobi Desert. A trajectory sector analysis revealed that the local emissions contributed 64.9-71.1% to the VOCs. OVOCs accounted for 43% of the ozone production potential (OFP), and residential biofuel use and waste disposal (25.1%), mixed industrial process-2 (15.3%) and solvent usage (13.4%) appeared to be the dominant sources contributors to O<sub>3</sub> production.
