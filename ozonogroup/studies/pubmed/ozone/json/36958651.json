This study investigated the relationship between PAN and PAN precursors with the Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism version 2 model in six episodes recorded in Zhengzhou. In all episodes, peroxyacetyl radical (PA) was primarily produced by acetaldehyde oxidation, with more than 70% contributions. In photochemical episodes and photochemical-haze co-occurring episodes (combined episodes), methylglyoxal secondarily contributes 8.1%-10.6% to PA while in haze pollution, the propagation of other radicals to PA is the second most important source (12.0%-19.1%). Among anthropogenic non-methane hydrocarbons, alkene restricted PAN formation as first-generation precursors, with the relative incremental reactivity of PAN (RIR<sub>PAN</sub>) more than 0.6 during three-type episodes. Nitrous acid (HONO) also played important role in PAN formation. Especially during photochemical episodes, RIR<sub>PAN</sub>(HONO) reached 0.79, which was comparable to the RIR<sub>PAN</sub> value of alkene. Through sensitivity analysis of the relative formation of PAN to O<sub>3</sub> (the amount of PAN generated when 100\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub> formed), HONO was identified as the key precursor of PAN in haze pollution by promoting the oxidation of NMHC, while alkene predominated the relative formation of PAN to O<sub>3</sub> in photochemical and combined pollution through producing acetaldehyde. The sensitivity of PAN to HONO is obviously enhanced with higher NOx/VOC ratios during photochemical and combined pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
