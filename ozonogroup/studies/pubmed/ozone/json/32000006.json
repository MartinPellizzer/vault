In a lab-scale Ozone reactor, the highest performance index was attained, when it was operated at a low O<sub>3</sub> flowrate (2\u00a0g/h) condition. The tannery effluent partially treated by Ozonation (\u224860% COD removed in 90\u00a0min) with the ozone consumption of 1.5\u00a0g of O<sub>3</sub>/g of COD, at pH 7.6, coupled with phycoremediation had improved the tannery effluent characteristics to a considerable extent. Overall, the maximum reduction in pollutant concentration attained with the combined treatment was 84% for COD, 60% for colour, 100% for odour, 90% for inorganic carbon, 82% for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>- N, 100% for PO<sub>4</sub>-P, 97% for chromium and 10% for TDS. In phycoremediation, microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata had shown an enhanced growth (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.255 day<sup>-1</sup>) with a maximum cell density of 5.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup>\u00a0cells/mL, dry biomass of 0.86\u00a0g\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and cell division rate of 0.369 day<sup>-1</sup>. Elemental analysis of biomass validated the chromium remediation along with other elements such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, zinc, and iron from the tannery effluent. Therefore, the phycoremediation integrated ozone process can be considered as a feasible treatment method for tannery effluent along with value-added biomass production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
