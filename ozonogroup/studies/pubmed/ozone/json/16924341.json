A total of 120 mL of S. aureus were mixed in 6 L of the experimental solutions (sterile distilled water, vinegar and sterile distilled water + Endozime AWpluz) used in a ultrasonic cleaning system (UCS). Ozone was produced by an electric discharge through a current of oxygen and bubbling with flow rate at 7 g/h ozone (1.2%) into the microbial suspensions. Ten mL of each experimental suspension were collected and 5 fold dilutions were made in 9 mL of BHI and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. At the same time, 1 mL of bacterial samples was collected and inoculated in BHIA plates. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the number of colony forming units (cfu) per mL on BHIA surface was counted. In dilution test in BHI tubes and in BHIA plates (cfu/mL), bacterial growth was not observed in any of the experimental solutions when ozone was added. Under the tested conditions, it may be concluded that the addition of ozone to a ultrasonic cleaning system containing different experimental solutions resulted in antibacterial activity against S. aureus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s, Goi\u00e2nia, GO, Brazil. estrela3@terra.com.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Estrela", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Estrela", "ForeName": "Cyntia R A", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Decurcio", "ForeName": "Daniel de Almeida", "Initials": "Dde A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Julio Almeida", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bammann", "ForeName": "Lili Luschke", "Initials": "LL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz Dent J", "NlmUniqueID": "9214652", "ISSNLinking": "0103-6440"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Infection Control, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16924341", "10.1590/s0103-64402006000200010", "S0103-64402006000200010"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
