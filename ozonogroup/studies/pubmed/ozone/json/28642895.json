Teeth were randomly divided into 7 equal groups (18 per group) as follows: group-1 served as control with no pre-treatment; group-2 enamel treated with fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector, Ivoclar Vivadent); group-3 containing casein-phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium-phosphate (CPP-ACP) paste (GC Tooth Mousse, RECALDENT\u2122); group-4 with ozone (HealOzone, Kavo<i>)</i>; group-5 with glycine powder (Perio Flow, EMS); group-6 with hydroxyapatite powder 99.5% (Coswell S.p.A.); group-7 with a toothpaste made of hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (BioRepair\u00ae Plus, Coswell S.p.A). Brackets were all bonded using the same technique with transbond XT (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, CA). All the bonded specimens were stored for 24 h in deionized water (37 \u00b0C) and subjected to thermal cycling for 1000 cycles. The SBS was measured with an Instron Universal Testing machine and the adhesive remnant was assessed with the adhesive remnant index (ARI) using a stereomicroscope at 10\u00d7 magnification. <i>Results</i>: Statistical differences (ANOVA) were found among the seven investigated groups (<i>F</i> = 12.226, <i>p <</i> 0.001). SBS of groups 2, 5 and 6 were significantly lower than the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). ARI scores (chi-square test) were correlated with the differences of SBS values. <i>Conclusion:</i> CPP-ACP paste, ozone or BioRepair\u00ae did not compromise on bracket bond strength. Fluoride, glycine or hydroxyapatite significantly decreased the SBS; only the fluoride group showed significant clinically low (<6 MPa) SBS values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Unit of Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of MilanMilanItaly."}], "LastName": "Cossellu", "ForeName": "Gianguido", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Unit of Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of MilanMilanItaly."}], "LastName": "Lanteri", "ForeName": "Valentina", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical, Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of PaviaPaviaItaly."}], "LastName": "Butera", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Unit of Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of MilanMilanItaly."}], "LastName": "Sarcina", "ForeName": "Michele", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Unit of Orthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of MilanMilanItaly."}], "LastName": "Farronato", "ForeName": "Giampietro", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biomater Odontol Scand", "NlmUniqueID": "101681462", "ISSNLinking": "2333-7931"}, "CoiStatement": "Authors have no relevant financial or non-financial relationship to disclose.
