After 47 h of time-on-stream on a supported palladium (Pd) catalyst, the gas phase composition of difluoromethane (HFC-32) is 41.0%, with 4.9% of the HCFC-22 remaining, indicating the conversion of up to 95.1% of HCFC-22. The supported nickel catalyst's deactivation is significant as it exhibits the low conversion of HCFC-22 under the same reaction conditions. The deactivation of the catalyst is caused by the polymerization of adsorbed methyl radicals, which competes with the formation of HFC-32. With concentrated reactants at high reaction temperatures, there was an increase in the catalytic activity; however, unwanted tar, methane, and trifluoromethane (HFC-23) by-products are also produced. The use of catalyst suppresses the formation of these by-products. Considering the compositions of the products of the catalytic and noncatalytic reactions, we demonstrate that the use of the supported-metal catalysts and hydrogen flow suppresses tar formation and lowers the required reaction temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clean Energy Research Center, National Agenda Research Division, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "Jeong-Myeong", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Daewoo", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jaehoon", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Byoung Sung", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yunje", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Jeong Won", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2229-07-4", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5TWQ1V240M", "NameOfSubstance": "Palladium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "75-45-6", "NameOfSubstance": "fluorocarbon 22"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OFM06SG1KO", "NameOfSubstance": "dichlorodifluoromethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Palladium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21847789", "10.1080/10934529.2011.586262"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
