We built different lag patterns and conducted stratification analyses by age, gender, and season. Moreover, we examined the robustness of the associations adopting two-pollutant models and fitted the concentration-response curves.", "We observed positive and significant associations at lag 0\u00a0day. Every 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag0) was associated with 1.06% (95% CI: 0.21%-1.91%) increases in hospitalizations for IS. The association remained stable and statistically significant to the adjustment of carbon monoxide and ozone. We observed that the associations were stronger in females and during cold seasons. The overall concentration-response relationship curve was linear positive and increased slowly but rose sharply at higher concentrations in the cold season.", "Our study added to the evidence that short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> may induce IS, and the government should take action to address the air pollution issues and protect susceptible populations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
