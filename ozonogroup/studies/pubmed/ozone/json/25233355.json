The LSOA compounds readily formed adducts with Na(+) under electrospray ionization conditions, with only a small fraction of compounds detected in the protonated form. In contrast, a significant fraction of PSOA compounds appeared in the protonated form because of their increased molecular rigidity. Laboratory simulated aging of LSOA and PSOA, through conversion of carbonyls into imines mediated by NH3 vapors in humid air, resulted in selective browning of the LSOA sample, while the PSOA sample remained white. Comparative analysis of the reaction products in the aged LSOA and PSOA samples provided insights into chemistry relevant to formation of brown carbon chromophores. A significant fraction of carbonyl-imine conversion products with identical molecular formulas was detected in both samples. This reflects the high level of similarity in the molecular composition of these two closely related SOA materials. Several highly conjugated products were detected exclusively in the brown LSOA sample and were identified as potential chromophores responsible for the observed color change. The majority of the unique products in the aged LSOA sample with the highest number of double bonds contain two nitrogen atoms. We conclude that chromophores characteristic of the carbonyl-imine chemistry in LSOA are highly conjugated oligomers of secondary imines (Schiff bases) present at relatively low concentrations. Formation of this type of conjugated compounds in PSOA is hindered by the structural rigidity of the \u03b1-pinene oxidation products. Our results suggest that the overall light-absorbing properties of SOA may be determined by trace amounts of strong brown carbon chromophores."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical Sciences Division and \u2021Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "Julia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laskin", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roach", "ForeName": "Patrick", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eckert", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gilles", "ForeName": "Mary K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bingbing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyun Ji Julie", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Qichi", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Imines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25233355", "10.1021/es503432r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
