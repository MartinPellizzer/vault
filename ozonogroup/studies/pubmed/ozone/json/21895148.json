The dynamics of the O + O(2) reaction and to a lesser extent the O(3) stabilization depend sensitively on the underlying potential energy surface, particularly in the asymptotic region. Highly accurate Davidson corrected multi-state multi-reference configuration interaction calculations reported here reveal that the minimal energy path for the formation of O(3) from O + O(2) is a monotonically decaying function of the atom-diatom distance and contains no \"reef\" feature found in previous ab initio calculations. The absence of a submerged barrier leads to an exchange rate constant with the correct temperature dependence and is in better agreement with experiment, as shown by quantum scattering calculations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 65409, USA. dawesr@mst.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dawes", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lolur", "ForeName": "Phalgun", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jianyi", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21895148", "10.1063/1.3632055"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
