The organic radicals, generated through the ethanol oxidation by O3, can oxidize NO into NO2, and finally into important industrial raw, namely, nitrate organics or aqueous nitrate acids. The residual ethanol in the tail can be recycled. The CO3(2-), HCO3(-) and SO2 in the flue gas hardly exhibit any effect on the NOX removal. Compared to the conventional O3 oxidation method, the present method shows higher selective oxidation of NO, higher NO(X) removal and less O3 consumption as well as proves lower initial investment and operating costs with more compact equipment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
