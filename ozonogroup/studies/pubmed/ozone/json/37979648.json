Substantial amounts of individual or mixtures of organic pollutants move into the surface water via point and non-point source contamination. Some of these compounds are known to be toxic and difficult to remove from water sources, thus affecting their quality. Moreover, environmental regulations in high-income countries have become very strict for drinking water treatment over the past decades, especially regarding pesticides. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of different residential water treatments to remove 13 pesticides with distinct physicochemical characteristics from the drinking water. Nine water treatments were used: four membrane filters, an activated carbon filter, ultraviolet radiation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange resins, and ozonation. The trial was performed with tap water contaminated with an environmental concentration of 13 pesticides. According to the results, activated carbon and reverse osmosis were 100% efficient for pesticide removal, followed by ion exchange resins and ultraviolet radiation. Membrane filters, in general, showed low efficiency and should, therefore, not be used for this purpose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
