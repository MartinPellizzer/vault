However, limited studies have estimated air pollution levels in consideration of the feedbacks of aerosols on meteorology in the SCB. In this study, simulation of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) over the SCB with a horizontal resolution of 36\u00a0km over China and 12\u00a0km was conducted for summer (July) and winter (January) in 2015 using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem). The model well captured the variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and daily maximum 8\u00a0h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> in the 18 cities, especially O<sub>3</sub> in July and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in January. From rim to center, averaged PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased from 40\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in January while averaged O<sub>3</sub> ranged from 60 to 90\u00a0ppb in July. Aerosol radiation decreased surface temperature by 1-2\u00a0\u00b0C, wind speed (WS) by\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.3\u00a0m/s, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height by 10-20%, solar radiation (SR) by \u223c30%, and precipitation by 0.02-0.2\u00a0mm, while increased relative humidity (RH) by up to 2-4% in January, which resulted in up to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in January and 2\u00a0ppb decrease of O<sub>3</sub> in July. The effect increased as the increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and can be up to 18% in January and 25% in July. This study highlights the importance of considering meteorology feedbacks in understanding and controlling air pollution in the SCB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
