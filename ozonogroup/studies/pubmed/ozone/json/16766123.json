The effect of several parameters (inlet dye concentration, applied ozone dose, pH and conductivity) in colour and TOC removal of an acid dye solution was investigated with the aim to optimize the operation conditions. The ozone consumption was measured in each experiment. Ozonation was found to be effective for decolourisation of an acid dye; however, it only has a slight effect on TOC removal. Increasing the inlet dye concentration leads to a decrease in the decolourisation efficiency and an increase in the ozone consumption. The decolourisation increases with the applied ozone dose. Colour removal efficiencies for different ozone doses were between 76 and 100%. In the pH range 5-9, the decolourisation efficiency decreases with pH only when buffered solutions were used. The presence of salt decreases the decolourisation efficiency. Several dyes of different classes were also studied and ozonation was found to be effective for decolourisation but considerably less efficient for TOC removal. Under the conditions tested, only the disperse and sulphur dyes presented a colour removal lower than 86%. Practical application of this process was validated by treating two industrial textile effluents collected after two different biological treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Cat\u00e1lise e Materiais, Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Engenharia, Universidade do Porto, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Ol\u00edvia Salom\u00e9 G P", "Initials": "OS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orf\u00e3o", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 J M", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Portela", "ForeName": "Dion\u00edsia", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vieira", "ForeName": "Ant\u00f3nio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "Manule Fernando R", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16766123", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.05.006", "S0304-3894(06)00451-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
