Little research has been done on the effects of prenatal exposure or the effect among asthmatics. The association between prenatal and early-life exposures and outdoor air pollutants with allergic sensitization was examined within a cohort of 170 children ages 6-11 years with asthma, living in the Central Valley of California. Allergic sensitization was ascertained by skin-prick tests to 14 allergens. Prenatal and early-life exposure to ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter < 10 micro m (PM(10)) was reconstructed for each child. Models were developed for sensitized to (a) any allergen, (b) at least one outdoor allergen, and (c) at least one indoor allergen. In multivariable analyses, higher exposure to CO during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of sensitization to at least one outdoor allergen. The largest effect was seen for the association between exposure to 8-hour daily maximum CO during pregnancy and sensitization to at least one outdoor allergen. (OR = 1.55 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.37)) per interquartile range (IQR) increase.) Similar effects estimates were seen for 2nd trimester exposure to CO, but these were less precisely estimated (OR = 1.45 (95%CI: 0.90, 2.35)). No significant associations with the pollutants were seen for sensitization to allergens in general or to at least one indoor allergen. Exposure to traffic-related pollutants during pregnancy may increase the risk of sensitization to outdoor allergens among asthmatic children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7370, USA. kmort@berkeley.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortimer", "ForeName": "Kathleen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neugebauer", "ForeName": "Romain", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lurmann", "ForeName": "Frederick", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alcorn", "ForeName": "Siana", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balmes", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tager", "ForeName": "Ira", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal-Fetal Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19085576", "10.1080/02770900802195722", "906806878"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
