It was demonstrated that ERG a- and b-waves decreased significantly 7-20 days after irradiation while latencies remained unchanged. It was also found that during this time period ERG wave amplitudes were dependent on the intensity: at higher intensities amplitudes of both waves diminished to a greater extent. After irradiation with a peak intensity photokeratoconjunctivitis was more severe and prolonged; however, the effect of irradiation with two other intensities was very similar. In view of the fact that the highest intensity of UV-B-radiation was comparable with that beyond the Earth's atmosphere while the lowest intensity was close to that near the Earth's surface, the above findings can be used to solve space biology problems and to assess potential effects of the ozone layer destruction on the eye."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belousov", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gramenitski\u012d", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Parametry \u00e9lektroretinogrammy i sostoianie rogovitsy glaza krolika posle ostrogo vozde\u012dstviia na glaz UF-izlucheniia razlichno\u012d intensivnosti."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Kosm Biol Aviakosm Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0417736", "ISSNLinking": "0321-5040"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electroretinography"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eye"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Keratoconjunctivitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1960951"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
