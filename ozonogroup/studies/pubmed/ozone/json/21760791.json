The methods applied were (a) ozone: O(3), (b) carbon dioxide: CO(2), and (c) O(2) absorber pads with and without vacuum. From all modified atmospheres evaluated, the best performance was obtained with O(3), either with or without vacuum. It was the only nut treatment that was able to degrade aflatoxins. None of the spiked (AFLs: 15\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)) nut samples O(3)- treated had aflatoxins detected up to the LC-MS/MS method LOQ (0.36\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) for total AFLs), thus producing safer nuts. Also it kept the fatty acid oxidation indicator-malondialdehyde stable and improved the sensory attributes for consumer acceptance. In addition, the destruction of fungi and yeast was observed since the O(3) application (from 1.8 \u00d7 10(4)\u2009cfu/g to NG = no growth). All other treatments stabilized and/or inhibited microorganisms' growth only. By adding CO(2) gas also played an important role in the nut quality. Regarding cost, gaseous O(3) showed to be of low cost for application in the nut packs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Mycotoxicology and Food Contaminants, Department of Food Science and Technology, Center of Agricultural Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, P.O.
