The rate coefficient for the OH reaction is reported in the temperature range 231-373 K, k(OH) = (5.7 +/- 0.2) x 10(-12) exp[(650 +/- 52)/T] cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1). This reaction is found to be pressure independent between 33 and 760 Torr. Rate coefficient (k(O3)) and gas phase products of the ozone reaction with allyl alcohol are reported at atmospheric pressure and 298 K. The obtained k(O3) = (1.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(-17) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1) is in good agreement with the single measurement reported in the literature. The reaction of 03 with allyl alcohol is found to lead to the formation of formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde as the main products. Other products such as CH3OH, CO and CO2 have also been observed in low yield. Aerosol formation has been detected in the ozonolysis of allyl alcohol and its size distribution investigated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICARE-CNRS, Orleans, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le Person", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solignac", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oussar", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Da\u00eble", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winterhalter", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moortgat", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19950501", "10.1039/b905776e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
