However, a noticeable gap exists regarding the attention directed towards susceptible demographics, specifically individuals afflicted by human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).", "A dataset comprising 1467 AIDS-related fatalities from 2013 to 2020 was amassed from the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily maximum 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> levels and meteorological parameters were extracted from the ChinaHighAirPollutants dataset and the National Meteorological Science Data Center, respectively. A time-stratified case-crossover methodology was employed to scrutinize the connection between short-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and AIDS-related deaths.", "A rise of one interquartile (IQR) in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, lagged by 4\u00a0days, was associated with a 15% [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 2, 31] increase in AIDS-related deaths. Notably, males demonstrated heightened susceptibility to the adverse consequences of O<sub>3</sub>, marked by an odds ratio of 1.20 (95% CIs: 1.05, 1.37) at lag 4\u00a0day. Additionally, patients aged over 65\u00a0years exhibited escalated vulnerability to brief O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Marriage status and educational attainment emerged as influential factors modifying the interplay between O<sub>3</sub> and AIDS-related mortality.", "Our study presents novel evidence spotlighting the deleterious repercussions of O<sub>3</sub> on mortality in the HIV/AIDS population."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
