In rank order, the highest PCNA index was found following 2.0 p.p.m. ozone exposure. In the 2.0 p.p.m. ozone group, there was a PCNA index of 16.83 +/- 0.57% (mean +/- SEM; P< 0.01), compared with 4.25 +/- 0.5% at 0.12 p.p.m., 6.83 +/- 0.60 at 0.5 p.p.m and 12.16 +/- 0.48% at 1 p.p.m. Following ozone exposure, Penh was increased in a dose-dependent manner. There was a significant correlation between the PCNA index in alveoli and Penh (r = 0.63, P< 0.01).", "These data suggest that ozone can induce alveolar epithelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and that alveolar epithelial cell proliferation is correlated with airway obstruction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Cheju National University College of Medicine, Jesu-si, Jeju-do, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "A-S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "I-S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koh", "ForeName": "Y-I", "Initials": "YI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "C-S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J-S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "7804028", "ISSNLinking": "0105-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Obstruction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12121195", "10.1034/j.1398-9995.2002.23569.x", "2s3569"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
