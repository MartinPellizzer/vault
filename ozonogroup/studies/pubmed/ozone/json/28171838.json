The results were evaluated by the removal of DOC that specifies organic matter, UV<sub>254</sub> absorbance, SUVA (Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance at 254\u00a0nm) and absorbance at 436\u00a0nm. When ozonation was used alone, DOC removal was 21.4% at an ozone concentration of 10\u00a0mg/L, pH 6.50 and oxidation time of 60\u00a0min. The results showed that the use of ICZ or GAC as a catalyst increased the decomposition of humic acid compared to ozonation alone. DOC removal efficiencies were 62% and 48.1% at pH 6.5, at a catalyst loading of 0.75\u00a0g/L, and oxidation time of 60\u00a0min for ICZ and GAC, respectively. The oxidation experiments were also carried out using <100\u00a0kDa and <50\u00a0kDa molecular size fractions of humic acid in the presence of ICZ or GAC. Catalytic ozonation also yielded better DOC and UV<sub>254</sub> reduction in both <50\u00a0kDa and <100\u00a0kDa fractions of HA compared to ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
