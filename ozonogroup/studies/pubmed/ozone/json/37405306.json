The general form of the limiting distributions of such sums for a wide class of models has been derived by Anderson and Dancy, and has suggested methods for the statistical analysis of data concerning extreme severity. This work is reviewed here, and some extensions to the distributional theory are presented. An application of the methods to atmospheric ozone levels, which calls for the extension of the approach to take account of covariate information is reported."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Probability and Statistics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Clive W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Res Natl Inst Stand Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "8912688", "ISSNLinking": "1044-677X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Anderson CW, Dancy GP.
