Here we present a new approach called Geographically Weighted Rotation Empirical Orthogonal Function (GWREOF) for air pollution regionalization in China. Compared with previous methods, such as EOF, REOF, and K-mean, GWREOF better accounts for the variability of air pollution conditions driven by emission patterns and meteorology with centralized spatial locations. We apply GWREOF to multiple air pollutants (such as PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and other monitored air pollutants) and air quality metrics using their measured spatial and temporal variations in 337 Chinese cities over 2015-2020. We find that the regionalization results for different air pollutants are highly similar, primarily determined by topography and meteorological conditions in China. Therefore, we propose an integrated regionalization result, which identifies 18 air pollution control regions in China and can be applied to multiple pollutants and different years. We further analyze PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>X</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>) pollution levels and their correlations in these regions. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> correlations are generally strongly positive in southern China while negative in northern China. However, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>X</sub> correlations are broadly positive in China, reflecting the crucial role of atmospheric oxidizing capacity. Regional-specific and coordinated control measures are in need as China's air pollution strategy transits from PM<sub>2.5</sub>-focused to PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> synergic control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
