The 4-point probe method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to measure the electrical, crystallographic, and morphological properties, respectively. During a UV treatment time of between 1 and 3 minutes, the sheet resistance increased dramatically to 0.55 \u03a9/sq. (the sheet resistance was 0.16 \u03a9/sq. prior to UV treatment) and these results were supported by a proportional decreased in XRD intensity. Thereafter, the sheet resistance decreased and the XRD intensity increased in response to increases in UV treatment time. These results were related to a change in crystal structure from Ag to AgOx, which could also have caused the change in sheet resistance. Based on these results, we propose a 3-step oxidation model of an Ag thin film according to UV treatment time. This proposal has been proven by nanoindentation testing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sung Joon", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Soo In", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Chang Woo", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26413681", "10.1166/jnn.2015.10255"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
