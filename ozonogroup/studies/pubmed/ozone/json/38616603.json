Conservative treatments like analgesics, physiotherapy do not work in all patients. Surgical treatment has been the mainstay of treatment when indicated but is associated with anesthetic and surgical complications. Intradiscal oxygen-ozone chemonucleolysis is a minimally invasive procedure done under local anesthesia and has promising role in shrinking the bulged disc and reducing nerve root compression and related symptoms. This retrospective study was done to see how intradiscal oxygen-ozone chemonucleolysis reduces pain severity in patients with discogenic low back pain.", "Retrospective data were retrieved of those patients who underwent fluoroscopy guided intradiscal oxygen-ozone chemonucleolysis with 5-6 ml of an O2-O3 mixture (concentration of 30 microgram/ml) during a period of two years in Nepal pain care and research center. Numerical pain scale (NRS) at various follow ups were compared to preprocedural NRS.", "Preprocedural NRS was 8\u00b1 13.
