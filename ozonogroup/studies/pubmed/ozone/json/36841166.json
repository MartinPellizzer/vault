With the continuous deepening understanding of the characteristics of two types sludge, the research and application of the collaborative disposal is worth considering. The heated modification DWS (HDWS) rich in inorganic matter and aluminum (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) can be used as a conditioner to enhance WAS dewaterability using its properties with physical skeleton and chemically catalyzed ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). The results showed that the minimum values of capillary water time (CST) and specific resistance filtration (SRF) for WAS were 20.9\u00b12.40 s and 1.07\u00b10.19\u00d710<sup>13</sup> m/kg at pH=4, O<sub>3</sub> dosage=60 mg/g VS and HDWS dosage=700 mg/g VS, corresponding to the reduction of sludge cake water content (Wc) to 60.37\u00b10.97 %. The mechanism of HDWS+O<sub>3</sub> enhanced WAS dewaterability was systematically elucidated through pyridine-infrared analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The surface of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in HDWS had more Lewis acidic sites, and the oxygen atoms of O<sub>3</sub> combined with Al atoms to form Al-O bonds and undergo electron transfer, while O<sub>3</sub> molecules dissociated to produce more hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH). With the oxidation of \u00b7OH, the extra-microcolony/cellular polymers (EMPS/ECPS) structure were destroyed and became looser, promoting the conversion of internal moisture to free moisture. Zeta potential tended to zero, particle size increased, and the surface was more hydrophobic. Correlation analysis revealed that the component content, protein (PN) secondary structure and molecular weight (MW) in ECPS were positively and more strongly correlated with the sludge dewaterability compared to EMPS. The discovery of HDWS+O<sub>3</sub> applied to effectively enhance WAS dewaterability provided an inspiring perspective on the emerging DWS and WAS co-processing disposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
