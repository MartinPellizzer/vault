We aimed to evaluate the associations between short-term exposure to six criteria air pollutants and hospitalization for T2D based on a national registry. We conducted an individual-level, time-stratified case-crossover study among inpatients with a primary diagnosis of T2D from 153 hospitals across 20 provincial regions in China (2013-2021). Daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), inhalable particle (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone were collected from the nearest monitoring stations. T2D patients were separated into those admission for T2D with and without complications. Distributed lag non-linear models combined with conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations. A total of 88,904 patients were hospitalized for T2D. Short-term exposures to all six air pollutants above except for ozone were significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization for T2D and both subclasses. An interquartile range increase in the concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO at lag 0-2\u202fd was associated with higher hospitalization risk of T2D by 1.71% (95%CI: 0.56%, 2.87%), 2.08% (0.88%, 3.29%), 4.85% (3.29%, 6.44%), 2.44% (1.22%, 3.67%) and 2.55% (1.24%, 3.88%), respectively. The associations of T2D hospitalizations were stronger in cold season than in warm season. Air pollutants had more acute and stronger associations with T2D with complications. The exposure-response relationship curves showed no thresholds, and the slopes were larger for T2D with complications. This nationwide individual-level, case-crossover study provides the first comprehensive evidence that short-term exposure to multiple criteria air pollutants may increase the risk of hospitalizations for T2D, especially for T2D with complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
