FeS combined ozonation achieved 74% of SN removal in 60\u00a0min under the optimal condition, which was 37% higher than by ozonation alone, and 12% higher than FeO combined ozonation. Highly active species of \u2022OH, \u2022SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> were detected in the FeS combined ozonation system, the evolution pathway of the involved species was expounded with the aid of DFT calculation. The results revealed that \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were originally formed via interface reactions on FeS surface, then gradually transformed into \u2022OH, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and \u2022SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> through subsequent chain reactions. Moreover, FeS had a lower energy barrier of 0.16\u00a0eV than FeO with a value of 0.83\u00a0eV for the transformation of ozone to active atomic oxygen. The presented study provided a significant insight into the role of Fe-based materials in ozonation, and was of great importance to guide the route for ozonation process improvement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
