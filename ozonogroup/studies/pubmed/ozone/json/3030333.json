Based on the known reactivity of these compounds towards cellular sulfhydryls (SH), the present studies were aimed at investigating cellular SH status in relation to O2- production. Plasma membrane surface SH groups were measured using carboxypyridinedisulfide and monitoring the resultant formation of mixed disulfides through assay of thione released into the supernatant fraction. Intracellular non-protein sulfhydryls were measured using 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. In both human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and rat pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) there was a dose-related decrease in surface SH and soluble SH after ACR and CRO treatment. Propionaldehyde, a three-carbon saturated aldehyde, was without effect. The decrease in surface SH was greater than the decrease in soluble SH. In addition, in PMN and PAM preincubated with 5-40 microM ACR, there was a dose-related inhibition in the rate of O2- production with no effect on the lag time as measured by cytochrome c reduction. In stimulated PMN, there was a dose-related decrease in the rate after addition of 5-40 microM ACR. These data suggest that changes in SH status by reactive aldehydes can modulate the activity of the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase responsible for O2- production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Witz", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawrie", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amoruso", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "B D", "Initials": "BD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES02510", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "NADPH Oxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NADPH Oxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3030333", "10.1016/0006-2952(87)90725-8", "0006-2952(87)90725-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
