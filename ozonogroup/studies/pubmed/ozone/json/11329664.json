It destroys harmful microbes, but it also degrades organic matter in water, increasing the bioavailability of organic matter. Recently, it was found that not only organic carbon but also phosphorus can limit the microbial growth in drinking water, which contains high amount of organic matter. We used a bioassay to analyze whether ozone could also increase the microbially available phosphorus (MAP) in drinking water, and whether MAP in ozone-treated water was associated with the growth of heterotrophic microbes. We found that both assimilable organic carbon and MAP concentrations were increased by ozone treatment. In ozonated water, microbial growth was mainly limited by phosphorus, and even minor changes in MAP concentration dramatically increased the growth potential of heterotrophic microbes. In this study, ozonation increased the MAP by 0.08-0.73 microgram P/l, resulting in an increase of 80,000-730,000 CFU/ml in water samples. In contrast to MAP, the content of assimilable organic carbon (AOCpotential) did not correlate with microbial growth. The results show that in water treatment not only AOCpotential but also MAP should be considered as an important factor that can limit microbial growth in drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology, National Public Health Institute, P.O.
