Three novel ozonation catalysts, i.e. cobalt-based, nickel-based and cobalt/nickel-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOF, Ni-MOF and Co/Ni-MOF), were synthesized, characterized by XRD, SEM, N<sub>2</sub> sorption-desorption isotherms, FTIR and XPS, and applied in catalytic ozonation for atrazine removal. It was found that the catalysts showed outstanding performance in the catalytic ozonation, especially Co/Ni-MOF which was attributed to multiple metal sites, higher coordination unsaturation, metal centers with larger electron density, and better efficiency in electron transfer than its single-metal counterparts. Under specific experimental conditions, 47.8%, 67.0%, 75.5%, and 93.9% of atrazine were removed after adsorption and degradation in the ozonation system without catalyst, and the catalytic ozonation systems with Co-MOF, Ni-MOF and Co/Ni-MOF, respectively. Higher removal rates could be achieved by growing initial pH, increasing oxidant dosage and reducing pollutant concentration, while an excess of Co/Ni-MOF was not favorable for the catalytic ozonation. Surface hydroxyl groups and acid sites were considered as the critical catalytic sites on Co/Ni-MOF. From the results of EPR tests, O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and \u00b7OH were ascertained as the main reactive species in the degradation. It was suspected that O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> played important roles in the formation of \u00b7OH and the cycle of Co(II)/Co(III) and Ni(II)/Ni(III). Additionally, Co/Ni-MOF displayed good stability and reusability in cycling experiments, ascribed to the enhancement of the porosity and pore hydrophobicity. Finally, based on MS/MS analysis at different reaction times, major degradation pathways for atrazine were proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
