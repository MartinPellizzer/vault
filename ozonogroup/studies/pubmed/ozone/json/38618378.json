It can be\u00a0managed either by blocking neural activities or by occluding tubules. Ozonated oil facilitates the simple passage of\u00a0desensitizing agents into dentinal tubules. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ozonated oil on dentinal tubule occlusion before and after the application of desensitizing toothpaste. Materials and methods The study was carried out in Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, KIIT (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, India.\u00a0The sample size of the study was 80. The first group contained specimens for control. The second group comprised specimens treated with ozonated oil. The third group comprised specimens being treated with a desensitizing agent. The fourth group contained specimens treated with both the desensitizing agent and ozonated oil. The specimens then received an acid challenge. The specimens were observed\u00a0under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) before any therapy, after the application of the therapeutic agents and after the 37.5% ortho-phosphoric acid challenge. Results Inferential statistics to compare between the groups was calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics. Post-hoc Tukey's\u00a0honestly significant difference (HSD) was performed to compare the groups. The mean scores\u00a0of the partial tubular occlusion of Group 1, Group 2, Group 3\u00a0and Group 4 before the acid challenge were\u00a00.035, 0.691, 0.564\u00a0and 0.368, respectively. The maximum score was obtained in the case of Group 2, which was statistically significant. The mean scores for partial\u00a0tubule occlusion\u00a0after the acid challenge\u00a0for\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3\u00a0and Group 4 were\u00a00.055, 0.531, 0.733\u00a0and 0.142, respectively. There was evidence of maximum\u00a0partial\u00a0tubule occlusion after the acid treatment in the case of Group 3. The mean scores of Group 1, Group 2, Group 3\u00a0and Group 4 before the acid challenge were 0.019, 0.309, 0.442 and 0.609, respectively. The maximum score was obtained in the case of Group 4, implying a greater number of total tubular occlusions before the acid challenge.\u00a0The mean scores of the total tubular occlusions after the acid challenge for Group 1, Group 2, Group 3\u00a0and Group 4 were\u00a00.047, 0.465, 0.272 and 0.890, respectively. There was evidence of maximum tubule occlusion in the case of Group 4, which was statistically significant. Conclusion Overall, the application of a desensitizing toothpaste with ozonated oil holds promise as a potentially more effective treatment approach for DH. Further research and clinical studies may be needed to fully validate its efficacy and safety in dental practice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Saha et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, Bhubaneswar, IND."}], "LastName": "Saha", "ForeName": "Mayurakshi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, Bhubaneswar, IND."}], "LastName": "Nc", "ForeName": "Sangamesh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, Bhubaneswar, IND."}], "LastName": "Bhuvaneshwari", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, Bhubaneswar, IND."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Silpiranjan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, Bhubaneswar, IND."}], "LastName": "Bajoria", "ForeName": "Atul Anand", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Maharashtra Institute of Dental Sciences and Research, Latur, IND."}], "LastName": "Male", "ForeName": "Vijaylaxmi P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Dentin hypersensitivity: recent trends in management.
