Furthermore, animal studies on circadian rhythmicity of airway resistance are very scanty. We used a plethysmographic method for unrestrained guinea pigs to monitor a lung resistance index (iRL) during 24 h. We found circadian variability of iRL values, which were fitted by a sinusoidal curve. Acrophase and bathyphase, characterizing the timing of narrowest and widest airway caliber, respectively, were found at 02:03, and 15:34 h. iRL values at these time-points were statistically different (P < 10(-5)). Moreover, average resistance during the dark period was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than during the light period. Immediately after an acute ozone exposure (3 ppm for 1 h) an increase in iRL was demonstrated (P < 0.01), which lasted for 2 h, and tended to remain high for the next hour. After guinea pigs recovered from this obstruction, the circadian rhythm and variability of airway caliber were unaffected. Our results show that a circadian rhythm of iRL takes place in guinea pigs, greatly resembling what occurs in humans, and that ozone exposure causes a transient airway obstruction, but fails to reproduce the increased variability of airway caliber observed in asthmatic patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Investigaci\u00f3n en Asma, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, M\u00e9xico DF, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sommer", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monta\u00f1o", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ch\u00e1vez", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gustin", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Respir Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0047142", "ISSNLinking": "0034-5687"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9840331", "10.1016/s0034-5687(98)00058-9", "S0034568798000589"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
