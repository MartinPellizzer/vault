We assessed the effects of air pollutants on the peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) and symptoms in asthmatics. A cohort of 121 asthmatics was followed daily, for 306 days, for their PEFR and asthma symptoms. The daily air pollutants, including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 \u03bcm, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 \u03bcm (PM(10)), carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and the meteorological parameters, including pressure, temperature, relative humidity, rain quantity, and sunshine duration, were monitored. The PEFRs were fitted with general linear mixed models. The asthma symptoms were analyzed with the generalized estimating equations. There were positive associations of NO(2) with morning PEFR, with a coefficient of 0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.00-0.12]; of SO(2) with evening PEFR [with a range of coefficients of 0.88-1.00 (95% CI, 0.31-1.54)] and daily average PEFR [with a coefficient of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.00-0.94)]; of PM(10) with evening PEFR, with a coefficient of 0.02 (95% CI, 0.00-0.04). There was also negative association of PM(10) with \u0394PEFR, with a coefficient of -0.01 (95% CI, -0.01 to -0.00). No pollutants were related to asthma symptoms. More studies are needed, particularly at low dose in adult asthmatics, to validate our findings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier GmbH.
