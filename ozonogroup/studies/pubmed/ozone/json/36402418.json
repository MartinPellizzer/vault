This study addressed their single and combined effects on BVOC emissions of Pinus thunbergii by laboratory simulation experiments. The results showed that light drought (LD, 50% soil volumetric water content (VWC)) stimulated isoprene, monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and total BVOC emissions, while moderate drought (MD, 30% and 40% VWC) and severe drought (SD, 10% and 20% VWC) inhibited their emissions (except for sesquiterpene in 20% VWC). N deposition decreased other VOC emissions and increased isoprene and sesquiterpene emissions. Total BVOCs and monoterpene were stimulated in low N deposition (LN, 2\u00a0g\u00a0N/(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7yr)) and inhibited in moderate (MN, 5\u00a0g\u00a0N/(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7yr)) and high N deposition (HN, 10\u00a0g\u00a0N/(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7yr)). Under combined treatment of soil drought and N deposition, total BVOC, monoterpene, and other VOC emissions were inhibited, sesquiterpene had no significant change, and isoprene emission was inhibited in MD combined treatment but promoted in SD. The O<sub>3</sub> formation potential (OFP) and SOA formation potential (SOAP) from the changed BVOC emissions were calculated, OFP and SOAP of BVOC emissions and their compositions varied significantly among the treatments. Our study provided theoretical basis for assessing the impact of climate change and atmospheric pollution on BVOC emissions and their contribution to the formation of secondary atmospheric pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
