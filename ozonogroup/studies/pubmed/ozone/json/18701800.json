The matrix-effect of wastewater was investigated performing ozone experiments under batch mode and continuous mode using drinking water and a wastewater issued from a local plant both spiked with the non-detected substances. The results obtained indicate that the wastewater matrix greatly affects the kinetics of ozone reaction with these substances but does not really change the related reactivity scale. The ozone dose corresponding to the full conversion of target EDCs consequently increases as their oxidation takes place competing with reactions of background pollutants represented by the COD and DOC content. However, a usual dose close to 12 mg/L was found sufficient to provide high degradation yields for all substances studied while 35% of COD was removed. This is a contribution to the numerous current works focused on technologies able to improve the quality of water discharged from wastewater treatment plants, both considering conventional parameters and emerging contaminants."], "CopyrightInformation": "IWA Publishing 2008."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Degr\u00e9mont SA, 183 av. du 18 juin 1940, 92500, Rueil-Malmaison, France. sylvie.baig@degremont.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baig", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansmann", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paolini", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18701800", "10.2166/wst.2008.665"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
