This is the first study attempting to assess the microbial infections associated with the reuse of WWTP effluents under various bulking conditions. Three common waterborne pathogens, viz., E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Mycobacterium, were quantified from full-scale WWTPs using DNA extraction and qPCR at different sludge volume indices (SVIs). The detected pathogens were incorporated into a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model to determine the applicability of WWTP discharge for recreational (bathing) activities and agricultural practices. The QMRA exposures were children, women, and men during swimming, and farmers and vegetable consumers during irrigation. Bacterial abundance in the treated wastewater increased in response to SVIs, and the QMRA values at all bulking events exceeded the tolerable risk of one case of infection per 10,000 people per year. Hence, various disinfection scenarios (chlorination, ultraviolet, and ozonation) were hypothetically tested to control the risks associated with pathogenic bacteria, allowing for safe disposal and reuse of the treated effluent. The ultraviolet application provided the highest ability to inactivate the pathogenic bacteria, except for the case of children exposed to Salmonella infection during swimming. The reduction of Mycobacterium infection risks with either chlorination or ozonation showed inefficient results. This study would be helpful for the management of human health risks associated with effluent wastewater containing pathogens, i.e., particularly concerning the case of sludge bulking."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
