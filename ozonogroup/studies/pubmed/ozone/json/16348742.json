This method is based on the UV sensitivity of a DNA repair-deficient strain of Bacillus subtilis (TKJ 6321). In our field experiment, dried layers of B. subtilis spores on quartz discs were exposed in different seasons in an exposure box open to solar radiation at the German Antarctic Georg von Neumayer Station (70 degrees 37'S, 8 degrees 22'W). The UV-induced loss of the colony-forming ability was chosen as the biological end point and taken as a measure for the absorbed biologically harmful UV radiation. Inactivation constants were calculated from the resulting dose-response curves. The results of field experiments performed in different seasons indicate a strongly season-dependent trend of the daily UV-B level. Exposures performed at extremely depleted ozone concentrations (October 1990) gave higher biologically harmful UV-B levels than expected from the calculated season-dependent trend, which was determined at normal ozone values. These values were similar to values which were measured during the Antarctic summer, indicating that the depleted ozone column thickness has an extreme influence on the biologically harmful UV climate on ground."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biophysics Division, Institute for Aerospace Medicine, German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), 5000 Cologne 90, and Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research, 2850 Bremerhaven, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puskeppeleit", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quintern", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El Naggar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schott", "ForeName": "J U", "Initials": "JU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eschweiler", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horneck", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fccker", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mutat Res. 1978 Feb;49(2):179-86", "ArticleIdList": ["415232"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1992 Feb 21;255(5047):952-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1546292"]}, {"Citation": "J Radiat Res. 1989 Dec;30(4):338-51", "ArticleIdList": ["2515279"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1974 Sep;71(9):3363-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4530308"]}, {"Citation": "Adv Space Res. 1984;4(10):19-27", "ArticleIdList": ["11539627"]}, {"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1978 May;27(5):571-9", "ArticleIdList": ["97682"]}, {"Citation": "Radiat Environ Biophys. 1991;30(2):87-103", "ArticleIdList": ["1907012"]}, {"Citation": "Mutat Res. 1981 Jul;82(2):263-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6790980"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16348742", "PMC195786", "10.1128/aem.58.8.2355-2359.1992"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
