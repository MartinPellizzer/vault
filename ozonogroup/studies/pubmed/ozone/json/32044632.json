To overcome these defects, hollow fiber membrane was applied in membrane contact ozonation (MCO)-UV process for the reactive brilliant red X-3B (RBRX-3B) degradation. The efficiency of mass transfer was guaranteed due to the enormous gas/liquid contact area supplied in this bubble-less O<sub>3</sub> transfer process. UV photolysis not only significantly improved the O<sub>3</sub> utilization efficiency but also accelerated the mineralization of RBRX-3B by promoting O<sub>3</sub> to decompose to hydroxyl radicals (OH). When 15\u2009mg/L of O<sub>3</sub> was supplied at flow rate of 0.2\u2009L/min, and a liquid velocity of 0.453\u2009m/s, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and total organic carbon (TOC) removal reached 90 % and 77 %, respectively. The rate constant for TOC removal in the MCO-UV process (7.89\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-3</sup>\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>) was 3.08 and 6.12 times higher than that in MCO and UV photolysis processes, respectively. Furthermore, the mineralization efficiency (\u0394COD/\u0394O<sub>3</sub>\u2009=\u20090.84\u2009mg/mg) and electrical energy per mass (E<sub>EM</sub>\u2009=\u20094.7\u2009kW\u2009h/kg) were calculated and these results indicated a promising future for the MCO-UV process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
