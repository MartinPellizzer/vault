Whole lung lavage determined that 129/Svlm, BTBR, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ had a peak increase in polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) at 6 h, whereas C57BL/6J and CAST/Ei had a peak increase at 24 h after exposure; airway PMNs were minimally elevated in A/J and C3H/HeJ; BALB/cJ had a predominant lymphocytic influx. Interleukin-6 concentration in the lavage fluid was associated with the influx of PMNs, whereas the total protein in the lavage fluid did not always correlate with lavage cellularity. Respiratory responses were monitored using whole body plethysmography and enhanced pause index. C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, 129/SvIm, and BTBR were highly sensitive to O3 and exhibited significant increases in enhanced pause to methacholine aerosol stimulation at 6 and 24 h after exposure to O3. In contrast, DBA/2J, A/J, FVB/NJ, CAST/Ei, and C3H/HeJ strains had demonstrated increases in sensitivity to MCh at 6 h after exposure, but responses had returned to near baseline by 24 h after exposure to O3. Epithelial cell proliferation as assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining was evident at 24 h after exposure to O3. C57BL/6J and A/J showed 4% proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells; 129/SvIm, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ had 1-3%; and BTBR, BALB/cJ, CAST/Ei, and C3H/HeJ had < 1%. Phenotypic measurements in six inbred strains were used for an in silico genome analysis based on the Roche mouse database. Consistent loci on chromosomes 1, 7, and 15 were among those identified to have a significant association with the phenotypes studied. In aggregate, our approach has identified O3-resistant (C3H/HeJ and A/J) and -vulnerable (C57BL/6J and 129/SvIm) strains of mice, and determined novel genomic loci, suggesting a clear genetic basis for the lung response to inhaled O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center and VA Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. jsavov@duke.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savov", "ForeName": "Jordan D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whitehead", "ForeName": "Gregory S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianme", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Guochun", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Usuka", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peltz", "ForeName": "Gary", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foster", "ForeName": "W Michael", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "David A", "Initials": "DA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES011961", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES012496", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES07498", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES11375", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL62641", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL66604", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL66611", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL67467", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0W5ETF9M2K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methacholine Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14975936", "10.1165/rcmb.2003-0001OC", "2003-0001OC"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
