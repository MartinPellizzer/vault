The application of such a statistic of representativeness has also been successfully demonstrated by two data sets collected at the Gu-Ting monitoring station in Taipei. By measuring NO2 at 22 sites simultaneously around the Gu-Ting station, the statistic has characterized different degrees of spatial representativeness for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at various areas and microenvironments surrounding this fixed-site monitoring station. By measuring ambient air concentrations at six sites sequentially around the Gu-Ting station, the statistic has also characterized different degrees of representativeness for particulates less than 10 urn in size-(PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), NO2, nitrogen oxides (NOX), nitrogen monoxide (NO), total hydrocarbons (THC), and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHQ-at an open area surrounding this fixed-site monitoring station. This statistical method identifies the Gu-Ting station is well representative of outdoor concentrations of all nine air pollutants for a period of three weeks at the areas within a 700 m radius around this station. The indoor NO2 concentrations, however, are not represented by the measurements at the fixed-site monitoring station."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Taiwan University, College of Public Health, Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial , Hygiene , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Chang-Chuan", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Jing-Shiang", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28067133", "10.1080/10473289.1996.10467510"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
