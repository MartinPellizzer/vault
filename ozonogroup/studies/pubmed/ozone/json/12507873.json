The results were compared with eucalyptus pulp in order to know that both raw materials have a similar behaviour. Ozone treatments were carried out in a special reactor at low consistency (0.5% o.d.p.). The main variables were consumption of ozone by the pulp and application of a xylanase treatment (X) prior to the oxygen stage (O). The responses measured were kappa number, viscosity and brightness, to give the kinetic expressions for delignification, cellulose degradation and elimination of chromophore groups, along with calculation of selectivity. Cellulose degradation and elimination of lignin and chromophore groups show first-order kinetics in all cases. The kinetics of the enzyme pre-treatment effect shows similar behaviour in both raw materials, although the constants of delignification and elimination of chromophore are higher in straw pulp."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Textile and Paper Engineering, E.T.S.E.I.
