Understanding the O<sub>3</sub> formation during autumn and winter is necessary to understand the atmospheric oxidative capacity. Therefore, continuous in-site field observations were carried out during the late summer, early autumn and winter of 2020 in a rural area of Chongqing. The total volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration reported by a Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) were 13.66 \u00b1 9.75 ppb, 5.50 \u00b1 2.64 ppb, and 9.41 \u00b1 5.11 ppb in late summer, early autumn and winter, respectively. The anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs) and biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) were 8.48 \u00b1 7.92 ppb and 5.18 \u00b1 2.99 ppb in late summer, 3.31 \u00b1 1.89 ppb and 2.19 \u00b1 0.93 ppb in autumn, and 6.22 \u00b1 3.99 ppb and 3.20 \u00b1 1.27 ppb in winter. A zero-dimensional atmospheric box model was employed to investigate the sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub>-precursors by relative incremental reactivity (RIR). The RIR values of AVOCs, BVOCs, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) were 0.31, 0.71, 0.09, and -0.36 for late summer, 0.24, 0.59, 0.22, and -0.38 for early autumn, and 0.30, 0.64, 0.33 and -0.70 for winter, and the results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> formation of sampling area was in the VOC-limited region, and O<sub>3</sub> was most sensitive to BVOCs (with highest RIR values, > 0.6). This study can be helpful in understanding O<sub>3</sub> formation and interpreting the secondary formation of aerosols in the winter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
