Plants were grown from seed for 8 wk in controlled-environment chambers and exposed to 70 \u03bcl O<sub>3</sub> l<sup>-1</sup> 7 h d<sup>-1</sup> for the whole period or for 2-wk episodes during weeks 1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 6 or 7 + 8. Controls had charcoal-filtered air. Effects on stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence and net photosynthesis are described. The fluorescence character, t<sub>1/2</sub> , proved to be very sensitive to ozone, and it responded at all stages of plant development, but the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence decreased only when plants received ozone during the first 2 wk of growth. The reduction was caused by a drop in maximum fluorescence. Ozone had no effect on F<sub>0</sub> . Whenever exposure occurred, O<sub>3</sub> significantly reduced net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and increased stomatal conductance. Unlike t<sub>1/2</sub> , the effects were persistent, affecting leaves that were in bud or enshrouded by leaves when the exposure occurred. It is suggested that these persistent effects may have been caused by changes in resource allocation, flowering and senescence, which resulted in altered hormonal balance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Ridley Building, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reiling", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Ridley Building, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davison", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Barnes JD, Davison AW, Booth TA. 1988.
