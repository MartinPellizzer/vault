Complement activation was observed by detecting C5b-9 protein level in cell culture supernatant using ELISA. HCECs were transfected with duplexes of siRNA targeting NLRP3 (NLRP3-siRNA) at 0.1 pmol/\u00b5l for 24\u00a0hours to inhibit the NLPR3 inflammasome pathway. RT-qPCR was performed to examine the efficacy of NLRP3-siRNA for inhibition; a random siRNA duplex was used for control siRNA.", "Both FBC exposure and OBC exposure for 72\u00a0hours significantly increased the C5b-9 protein level compared to negative control cells (all <i>P</i> <\u00a0.05). However, the difference in C5b-9 level after FBC exposure and OBC exposure was not statistically significant (<i>P</i> >\u00a0.05). NLRP3-siRNA transfection reduced C5b-9 protein levels in FBC-treated and OBC-treated HCECs compared to control (lowered by 27% in the FBC-treated group and by 23% in the OBC-treated group, all <i>P</i> <\u00a0.05).", "BC particles, including FBC and OBC, triggered complement activation, increasing the protein level of C5b-9 in cultured HCECs. siRNA targeting NLRP3 to inhibit NLRP3 generation reduced C5b-9 protein level in HCECs treated with FBC or OBC particles, indicating that BC induces complement activation potentially through the NLRP3 inflammasome in HCECs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liqiang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Curr Eye Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8104312", "ISSNLinking": "0271-3683"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement Membrane Attack Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammasomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Membrane Attack Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammasomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "7"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34375537", "10.1080/02713683.2021.1967404"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
