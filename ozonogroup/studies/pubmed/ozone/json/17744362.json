Chlorine (Cl(2)) is released into the gas phase on a time scale of at most a few milliseconds, whereas nitric acid (HNO(3)), the other product, remains in the condensed phase. This reaction could play an important role in explaining the observed depletion of ozone over Antarctica; it releases photolytically active chlorine from its most abundant reservoir species, and it promotes the formation of HNO(3) and thus removes nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) from the gas phase. Hence it establishes the necessary conditions for the efficient catalytic destruction of ozone by halogenated free radicals. In the absence of HCl, ClONO(2) also reacts irreversibly with ice with a collision efficiency of approximately 0.02 at 200 K; the product hypochlorous acid (HOCI) is released to the gas phase on a time scale of minutes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Molina", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tso", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Molina", "ForeName": "L T", "Initials": "LT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "F C", "Initials": "FC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17744362", "10.1126/science.238.4831.1253", "238/4831/1253"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
