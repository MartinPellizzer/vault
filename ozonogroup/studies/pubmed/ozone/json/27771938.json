PCR/RFLP analysis was used to genotype C677T-MTHFR.", "Overall, cumulative UV-irradiance (42 and 120 days pre-clinic) was significantly negatively related to red cell folate (RCF) levels. When the cohort was stratified by MTHFR-C677T genotype, the relationship between UV-irradiance (42 days pre-clinic) and RCF remained significant only in the cohorts containing carriers of the T allele. Statistically significant z-score statistics and interaction terms from genotype and UV-irradiance (p-interaction) demonstrated that genotype did modify the effect of UV-irradiance on RCF, with the largest effect of UV being demonstrated in the 677TT-MTHFR subjects.", "Data provide strong evidence that surface UV-irradiance reduces long-term systemic folate levels, and that this is influenced by the C677T-MTHFR gene variant. We speculate this effect may be due to 677TT-MTHFR individuals containing more 5,10CH<sub>2</sub> -H<sub>4</sub> PteGlu, and that this folate form may be particularly UV labile. Since UV-irradiance lowers RCF in an MTHFR genotype-specific way, there are likely implications for human health and the evolution of skin pigmentation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, PO Box 127, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Lucock", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, PO Box 127, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Beckett", "ForeName": "Emma", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, PO Box 127, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "Charlotte", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, PO Box 127, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Patrice", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Maths and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle, PO Box 127, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Furst", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, PO Box 127, Brush Rd, Ourimbah, NSW, 2258, Australia."}], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "Zoe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anthropology Department, The Pennsylvania State University, 409 Carpenter Building, University Park, Pennsylvania, 16802."}], "LastName": "Jablonski", "ForeName": "Nina G", "Initials": "NG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anthropology Department, The Pennsylvania State University, 409 Carpenter Building, University Park, Pennsylvania, 16802."}], "LastName": "Chaplin", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, NSW, 2308, Australia and, Central Coast Local Health District, Teaching and Research Unit, Gosford Hospital, Gosford, NSW, 2250, PO Box 361, Australia."}], "LastName": "Veysey", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Hum Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8915029", "ISSNLinking": "1042-0533"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "935E97BOY8", "NameOfSubstance": "Folic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Folic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New South Wales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrigenomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27771938", "10.1002/ajhb.22929"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
