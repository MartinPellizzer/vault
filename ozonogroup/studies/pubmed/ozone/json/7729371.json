This study investigated intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and H+ extrusion mechanisms of PM phi from rabbits exposed to sulfuric acid, ozone, and their mixtures. Animals were exposed for 3 h to 125 micrograms/m3 sulfuric acid, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 ppm ozone, or combinations of acid with each concentration of ozone, and the pHi was determined by a fluorescent dye ratioing technique. Exposure to 125 micrograms/m3 acid reduced pHi and exposure to ozone resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in pHi. Ozone generally tended to mitigate the effect of the acid aerosol on pHi. Other groups of rabbits were exposed to 50 micrograms/m3 sulfuric acid, 0.6 ppm ozone, or their mixture, for 3 h, and PM phi were again harvested. The pHi of PM phi following exposure to each of the pollutant atmospheres was not different from control. However, H+ extrusion with an imposed internal acid load was found to be significantly depressed following exposure to either sulfuric acid or ozone alone, while the mixture produced a significant interaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, Tuxedo 10987."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amdur", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlesinger", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01-ES02429", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7729371", "10.3109/01902149509031748"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
