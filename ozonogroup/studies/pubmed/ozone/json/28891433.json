In the present study, we determined the role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the pathogenesis of ozone-induced nonatopic asthma by using lymphoid cell-sufficient C57BL/6 mice, ILC-sufficient Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (devoid of T and B cells), and ILC-deficient Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup> mice (depleted of all lymphoid cells including ILCs). Mice were exposed to 0 or 0.8 parts per million ozone for 1 day or 9 consecutive weekdays (4 hr/day). A single exposure to ozone caused neutrophilic inflammation, airway epithelial injury, and reparative DNA synthesis in all strains of mice, irrespective of the presence or absence of ILCs. In contrast, 9-day exposures induced eosinophilic inflammation and mucous cell metaplasia only in the lungs of ILC-sufficient mice. Repeated ozone exposures also elicited increased messenger RNA expression of transcripts associated with type 2 immunity and airway mucus production in ILC-sufficient mice. ILC-deficient mice repeatedly exposed to ozone had no pulmonary pathology or increased gene expression related to type 2 immunity. These results suggest a new paradigm for the biologic mechanisms underlying the development of a phenotype of childhood nonatopic asthma that has been linked to ambient ozone exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Kumagai", "ForeName": "Kazuyoshi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Lewandowski", "ForeName": "Ryan P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Jackson-Humbles", "ForeName": "Daven N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Buglak", "ForeName": "Nicholas", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "Kaylin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Van Dyken", "ForeName": "Steven J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "James G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA."}], "LastName": "Harkema", "ForeName": "Jack R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "7905907", "ISSNLinking": "0192-6233"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Il2rg protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Rag2 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Innate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Mucosal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metaplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Knockout"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Eosinophilia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mucosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28891433", "10.1177/0192623317728135"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
