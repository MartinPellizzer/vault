However, neither the current observable indicators nor the current indicators based on response-surface modeling (RSM) can fulfill this requirement. Therefore, this study developed new observable RSM-based indicators and applied them to ambient fine particle (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution control in China. The performance of these observable indicators in predicting O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> chemistry was compared with that of the current RSM-based indicators. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u00d7HCHO/NO<sub>2</sub> and total ammonia ratio, which exhibited the best performance among indicators, were proposed as new observable O<sub>3</sub>- and PM<sub>2.5</sub>-chemistry indicators, respectively. Strong correlations between RSM-based and traditional observable indicators suggested that a combination of ambient concentrations of certain chemical species can serve as an indicator to approximately quantify the response of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> to changes in precursor emissions. The observable RSM-based indicator for O<sub>3</sub> (observable peak ratio) effectively captured the strong NO<sub>x</sub>-saturated regime in January and the NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime in July, as well as the strong NO<sub>x</sub>-saturated regime in northern and eastern China and their key regions, including the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The observable RSM-based indicator for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (observable flex ratio) also captured strong NH<sub>3</sub>-poor condition in January and NH<sub>3</sub>-rich condition in April and July, as well as NH<sub>3</sub>-rich in northern and eastern China and the Sichuan Basin. Moreover, analysis of these newly developed observable response indicators suggested that the simultaneous control of NH<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions produces greater benefits in provinces with higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure by up to 1.2 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> per 10 % NH<sub>3</sub> reduction compared with NO<sub>x</sub> control only. Control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by as much as 40 % of NO<sub>x</sub> controls is necessary to obtain the cobenefits of reducing both O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure at the national level when controlling NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. However, the VOC-to-NO<sub>x</sub> ratio required to maintain benefits varies significantly from 0 to 1.2 in different provinces, suggesting that a more localized control strategy should be designed for each province."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Dian", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuxiao", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Zhaoxin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "James T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Carey", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jiming", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Atmos Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "101214388", "ISSNLinking": "1680-7316"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ansari AS, and Pandis SN: Response of inorganic PM to precursor concentrations, Environ.
