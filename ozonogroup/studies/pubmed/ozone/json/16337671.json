The chronic toxicity of the effluents was evaluated by the ability to inhibit the growth of algae Selenastrum capricornutum. Cultured hamster V79 fibroblasts were used to assess the cytotoxicity of effluents submitted to different detoxification processes. Two endpoints were measured in V79 cells: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction and neutral red uptake (NRU). Both treatment processes were able to reduce the TOC, although ozonization was less effective for pulp mill ECF bleaching. The pulp mill ECF bleaching and textile effluents reduced the growth of S. capricornutum by 39% and 27%, respectively. However, at the highest concentration tested, the textile effluents treated by photochemical process for 60 min showed increased cytotoxicity in V79 cells compared to the untreated effluent when assessed by the NRU and MTT reduction assays (increases of 30% and 40%, respectively). Pulp mill ECF bleaching effluent treated by ozonization had a similar cytotoxicity to that of untreated effluent in the NRU assay. In contrast, the MTT reduction assay indicated that effluents treated with ozone were around 20% more cytotoxic than untreated effluents. These results show that cultured fibroblasts may be useful for studying cellular responses to pollutants and may be included in tests to monitor the efficiency of effluent detoxification processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), CP 6109, Campinas, SP 13083-970, Brazil. pmelo@unicamp.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melo", "ForeName": "Patricia Silva", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabrin-Neto", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o Batista", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Moraes", "ForeName": "Sandra Gomes", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Assalin", "ForeName": "M\u00e1rcia Regina", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dur\u00e1n", "ForeName": "Nelson", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haun", "ForeName": "Marcela", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textiles"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16337671", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.01.081", "S0045-6535(05)00235-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
