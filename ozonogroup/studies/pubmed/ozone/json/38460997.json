Conventional methods such as brining, marinating, and baking, are the main approaches to remove the fishy odor. Although these methods have shown notable efficacy, there are simultaneously inherent drawbacks that ultimately diminish the processability of raw materials, encompassing alterations in the original flavor profiles, the potential generation of harmful substances, restricted application scopes, and the promotion of excessive protein/lipid oxidation. In response to these challenges, recent endeavors have sought to explore innovative deodorization techniques, including emerging physical processing approaches, the development of high-efficiency adsorbent material, biological fermentation methods, and ozone water rinsing. However, the specific mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of these deodorization techniques remain not fully elucidated. This chapter covers the composition of major odor-causing substances in food, the methodologies for their detection, the mechanisms governing their formation, and the ongoing development of deodorization techniques associated with the comparison of their advantages, disadvantages, and application mechanisms. The objective of this chapter is to furnish a theoretical framework for enhancing deodorization efficiency through fostering the development of suitable deodorization technologies in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
