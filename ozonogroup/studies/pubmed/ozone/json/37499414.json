This work investigated the co-pollution of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Hainan Province using an observation-based model and explainable machine learning. The O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution that occurs in winter is affected by the wintertime East Asian Monsoon. The O<sub>3</sub> formation shifts from a NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime with a low O<sub>3</sub> production rate (P<sub>O3</sub>) in the non-pollution season to a transition regime with a high P<sub>O3</sub> in the pollution season due to an increase in NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations. Increased O<sub>3</sub> and atmospheric oxidation capacity promote the conversion from gas-phase precursors to aerosols. Meanwhile, the high concentration of particulate nitrate favors HONO formation via photolysis, in turn facilitating O<sub>3</sub> production. Machine learning reveals that NO<sub>x</sub> promotes O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> co-pollution during the pollution period. The P<sub>O3</sub> shows an upward trend at the observation site from 2018 to 2022 due to the inappropriate reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NO<sub>x</sub> in the upwind areas. Our results suggest that a deep reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> should benefit both O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution control in Hainan and bring new insights into improving air quality in other regions of China in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
