The concentration curve of ozone was drawn by standard iodine method. The operating factors included mole ratio of ozone to sulfur dioxide and concentration of Mn2+. When absorption solution has no Mn2+, the removal efficiency of SO2 was 35% at [O3 ]/[SO2 ] = 0.5,but the efficiency was 70% when Mn2+ was put into absorption solution at the same value of [O3 ]/[SO2].With the increasing of [3O]/[SO2], the removal efficiency of SO2 increases. And as concentration of Mn2+ increases, the efficiency also increases. There is an appropriate concentration range which is 1.2 x 10(-2)-1.2 x 10(-1) mol/L for Mn2+."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, North China Electric Power University, Baoding 071003, China. msc1225@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shuang-Chen", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jing-Xiang", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yun-Xue", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20063725"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
