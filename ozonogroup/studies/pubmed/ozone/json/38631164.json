However, a comprehensive DOM study for the whole water supply system is lacking and the potential effects of secondary water supply are largely unknown. This was studied using dissolved organic carbon (DOC), absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Four fluorescent components were identified, including humic-like C1-C2, tryptophan-like C3, and tyrosine-like C4. In the drinking water treatment plants, the advanced treatment using ozone and biological activated carbon (O<sub>3</sub>-BAC) was more effective in removing DOC than the conventional process, with the removals of C1 and C3 improved by 17.7%-25.1% and 19.2%-27.0%. The absorption coefficient and C1-C4 correlated significantly with DOC in water treatments, suggesting that absorption and fluorescence could effectively track the changes in bulk DOM. DOM generally remained stable in each drinking water distribution system, suggesting the importance of the treated water quality in determining that of the corresponding network. The optical indices changed notably between distribution networks of different treatment plants, which enabled the identification of changing water sources. A comparison of DOM in the direct and secondary water supplies suggested limited impacts of secondary water supply, although the changes in organic carbon and absorption indices were detected in some locations. These results have implications for better understanding the changes of DOM in the whole water supply system to help ensure the supplied water quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
