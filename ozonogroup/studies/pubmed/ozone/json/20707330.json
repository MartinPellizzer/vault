Although ozone is an unstable substance and is apt to decay to oxygen (O(2)), it may be preserved for a prolonged time if it is encaged in hydrate cavities in the form of isolated molecules. This possibility was assessed using a hydrate formed from an ozone + oxygen gas mixture coexisting with carbon tetrachloride or xenon. Each hydrate sample was stored in an air-filled container at atmospheric pressure and a constant temperature in the range between -20 and 2 degrees C and was continually subjected to iodometric measurements of its fractional ozone content. Such chronological measurements and structure analysis using powder X-ray diffraction have revealed that ozone can be preserved in a hydrate-lattice structure for more than 20 days at a concentration on the order of 0.1% (hydrate-mass basis)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama 223-8522, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muromachi", "ForeName": "Sanehiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohmura", "ForeName": "Ryo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takeya", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "Yasuhiko H", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem B", "NlmUniqueID": "101157530", "ISSNLinking": "1520-5207"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20707330", "10.1021/jp105031n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
