Hospital admissions for MI and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period from 2006 to 2010. The relative risk (RR) of hospital admissions for MI was estimated using a time-stratified case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased RR for a number of MI admissions was significantly associated with higher O<sub>3</sub> levels both on warm days (>23\u00b0C) and on cool days (<23\u00b0C). This observation was accompanied by an interquartile range elevation correlated with a 7% (95% CI = 2%-12%) and 17% (95% CI = 11%-25%) rise in number of MI admissions, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, no significant associations between ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and number of MI admissions were observed on warm days. However, on cool days, correlation between ambient O<sub>3</sub> after inclusion of each of the other five pollutants, particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub> or PM<sub>2.5</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO), and number of MI admissions remained significant. This study provides evidence that higher levels of ambient O<sub>3</sub> increase the RR of number of hospital admissions for MI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology , College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Hui-Fen", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics , Chang Gung, Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Yi-Hao", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Master Program in Global Health and Development, College of Public Health and Nutrition, Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine , National Health Research Institute , Miaoli , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28598271", "10.1080/15287394.2017.1321092"]}}]}
