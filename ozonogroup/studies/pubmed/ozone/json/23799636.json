The present study looks at the surface steady-state concentration of (1)O2 and quantum yields (\u03a6SO) for organic matter present in or derived from wastewater (WWOM), including those that are partially treated and after undergoing oxidation. The surface steady state concentrations of (1)O2 ranged from 1.23 to 1.43 \u00d7 10(-13) M for bulk wastewaters under simulated sunlight. The \u03a6SO values for these samples varied from 2.8% to 4.7% which was higher than the values observed for the natural organic matter isolates evaluated (1.6-2.1%). Size fractionation of WWOM resulted in \u03a6SO increases, with a value of up to 8.6% for one of the <1 kDa fractions. Furthermore, oxidation of WWOM by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and molecular ozone also resulted in an increase in \u03a6SO, with the highest measured value being 9.3%. This research further explores the correlations between the photosensitizing properties of WWOM and optical characteristics (e.g., absorbance, E2:E3 ratio). Making use of easily measurable absorbance values, a model for the prediction of (1)O2 steady-state concentrations is proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, 428 UCB, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mostafa", "ForeName": "Sim\u00f3n", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosario-Ortiz", "ForeName": "Fernando L", "Initials": "FL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23799636", "10.1021/es401814s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
