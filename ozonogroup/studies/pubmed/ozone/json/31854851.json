The results are as follows. \u2460 In the temporal distribution, the inter-annual variation of absorptive aerosol optical depth (AAOD) first increased and then decreased, reaching the highest value of 0.056 in 2011; this is consistent with the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 0.702 in the Yangtze River Delta. The inter-monthly variation shows that the high value of AAOD appeared mostly in January, March, and June and increased significantly from November to January. \u2461 In the spatial distribution, the AAOD was higher in the north than in the south in the Yangtze River Delta, and the AOD was similar to the AAOD. High values of AAOD above 0.05 were concentrated mainly in northern Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Jinhua. The seasonal spatial distribution of AAOD and AOD was higher in spring and winter and lower in autumn, although the AOD was very high and the AAOD was low in summer. The contribution of black carbon in the Yangtze River Delta was consistent with the annual spatial distribution of the AAOD and AOD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Fan-Shi", "Initials": "FS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Desert Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Urumqi 830002, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yong-Hang", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yi-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Jia", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31854851", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201811211"]}}]}
