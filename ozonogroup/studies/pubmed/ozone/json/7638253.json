In 1993 the depletion persisted up to the end of May, resulting in a significant increase of biologically effective UV radiation. The increases were significantly smaller in 1992 and 1993 than in 1993. The UV exposure of the Finnish population was evaluated through measurements and theoretical calculations. The increase in measured erythemal (International Lighting Commission) UV falling onto horizontal surfaces on clear day was determined relative to model calculations for an average ozone amount. The increase was on average 10% from April to May 1993, and the maximal measured increase was 34%. Theoretical calculations for both erythemal and carcinogenic (Skin Cancer Utrecht--Philadelphia) UV indicated that in 1993 the theoretical annual increase to a vertical (cylinder) surface ranged from 8 to 13% in Finland. The reflection of UV from snow considerably increases facial UV doses in Northern Finland."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jokela", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leszczynski", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Visuri", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ylianttila", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eye"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Face"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Finland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7638253", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb05245.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
