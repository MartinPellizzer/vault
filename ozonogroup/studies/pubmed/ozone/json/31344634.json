When the HPAM concentration was 500\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> and the ozone dose was 25\u202fg O<sub>3</sub>/g TOC, the HPAM removal rate reached 90.79%. Experimental results obtained from gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and rheometer indicated that the refractory HPAM was decomposed into small-molecule compounds. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that there was no acrylamide (AM) in the effluent of the system. Microbial communities in two aerobic biofilm reactors (ABRs) were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq Sequencing, which indicated that norank_f_Cytophagaceae, Meiothermus, Bacillus, etc. were keystone functional bacterial genera and Methanobacterium, norank_p_Bathyarchaeota, norank_c_Marine_Group_\u2160, etc. were dominant functional archaeal groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to treat HPAM-containing wastewater using an aerobic-ozonic-aerobic hybrid process. Good removal efficiencies and presence of functional microorganisms demonstrated that the hybrid treatment system was practical for treating HPAM-containing wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
