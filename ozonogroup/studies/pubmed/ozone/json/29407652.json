The applicability of the modified R<sub>ct</sub> concept was demonstrated using different GO suspensions (GO alone, GO/TiO<sub>2</sub>, GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, GO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) in ozonation process. Results showed that ozone exposure and \u2022OH exposure were found to be higher for GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and GO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> compared to other GO suspensions, which was almost equivalent to O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. The determined initiation and inhibition rate constants of GO alone, were 1 fold higher than GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and GO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, since the GO alone suspension possesses higher O<sub>3</sub> decomposition but lower organic degradation because that GO does not yield \u2022OH. Moreover, GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> suspension, along with natural organic matter (NOM), was proven to be helpful in degrading ibuprofen in ozonation process, but the effect was minimal when compared to O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. These results exhibited that the surface modified GO suspensions could be utilized as future alternative AOPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
