There were 84 h (in 24 days) of ozone episodes (>100 ppbv) observed during the study. June was the most polluted month in the year. The earliest episode observed in May 4 was mainly caused by the favorable meteorological condition for ozone production and accumulation. A multi-day episode from 6 to 8 June was related to the passage of typhoon Nesat. 39 h (in 11 days) of ozone episodes were observed from June 10 to 24. Large scale stagnation, recirculation of air mass, intense solar radiation, high temperature and long-rang transport of pollutants were the main reason for the ozone episodes during this period."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, 250100, People's Republic of China. yqyin@sdu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yongquan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Haixia", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Wenpo", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19458881", "10.1007/s00128-009-9781-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
