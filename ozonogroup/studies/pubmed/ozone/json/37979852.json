We conducted field experiments in four highly polluted rice growing environments of Bangladesh in three cropping seasons (2020-2022), in which we grew 20 different rice varieties with or without application of the ozone protectant ethylene diurea (EDU). The average daytime ozone concentrations at the study sites during the rice growing seasons ranged from 53\u00a0ppb to 84\u00a0ppb, with the lowest concentrations occurring in the year 2020. EDU increased rice grain yields significantly by an average of 10.4\u00a0% across all seasons and locations, indicating that plants were stressed under ambient ozone concentrations. EDU was effective in distinguishing ozone-tolerant from ozone-sensitive varieties, in which yield increased by up to 21\u00a0%. Likewise, the EDU treatment positively affected vegetation indices representing chlorophyll (NDVI), the chorophyll:carotenoid ratio (Lic2), and pigments of the xanthophyll cycle (PRI). Stomatal conductance was increased significantly by an average of around 10\u00a0% among all varieties when plants were treated with EDU. In all physiological traits, significant genotype by treatment interactions occurred, indicating that different varieties varied in their responses to ozone stress. Our study demonstrates that rice production in Bangladesh is severely affected by tropospheric ozone, and calls for the breeding of tolerant rice varieties as well as mitigation measures to reduce air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
