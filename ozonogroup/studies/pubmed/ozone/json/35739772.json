The catalyst was prepared by directly growing \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanorods on Al honeycomb substrate (MnO<sub>2</sub>/Al) via a simple hydrothermal process, and the EAOD mode was performed just by connecting the MnO<sub>2</sub>/Al monolith catalyst with a DC power supply during ozone decomposition reaction. In the EAOD mode reaction, the MnO<sub>2</sub>/Al catalyst exhibited a stable ozone conversion efficiency of over 82 % and excellent stability over 720\u00a0min under a relative humidity of 90%, well beyond the performance of catalyst in the conventional ozone decomposition reaction without the help of electric aid. Here, the water evaporation by the external electric field generated from the EAOD mode hinders the competitive adsorption of water vapor on the active sites of MnO<sub>2</sub>/Al catalyst, consequently enhances its water resistance. Moreover, increasing input electric current of the DC power supply could further improve the catalytic activity and stability of the monolith catalyst for ozone decomposition in EAOD mode reaction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
