Two white clover clones, which were resistant (NC-R) or sensitive (NC-S) to ozone injury, were evaluated. Plant growth and M. incognita reproduction were measured. Root, stolon, and top growth were reduced by PSV infection, which affected NC-R more than NC-S. Both clones were tolerant of M. incognita, but NC-R had less root galling and less nematode reproduction than NC-S, and thus was less susceptible to M. incognita. Reductions in root growth of plants infected with both M. incognita and PSV were greater than in plants infected by either pathogen alone. Nematode reproduction tended to be lower on PSV-infected plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McLaughlin", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Windham", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heagle", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "J Nematol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884299", "ISSNLinking": "0022-300X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19279855", "PMC2619439"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
