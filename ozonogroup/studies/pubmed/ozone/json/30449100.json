Peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) are central intermediates in the BVOC oxidation process. Under clean (low-NO <sub>x</sub>) conditions, the main bimolecular sink reactions for RO<sub>2</sub> are with the hydroperoxy radical (HO<sub>2</sub>) and with other RO<sub>2</sub> radicals. Especially for small RO<sub>2</sub>, the RO<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> reaction mainly leads to closed-shell hydroperoxide products. However, there exist other known RO<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> and RO<sub>2</sub> + RO<sub>2</sub> reaction channels that can recycle radicals and oxidants in the atmosphere, potentially leading to lower-volatility products and enhancing SOA formation. In this work, we present a thermodynamic overview of two such reactions: (a) RO<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RO + OH + O<sub>2</sub> and (b) R'O<sub>2</sub> + RO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 R'O + RO + O<sub>2</sub> for selected monoterpene + oxidant derived peroxy radicals. The monoterpenes considered are \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, limonene, trans-\u03b2-ocimene, and \u0394<sup>3</sup>-carene. The oxidants considered are the hydroxyl radical (OH), the nitrate radical (NO<sub>3</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). The reaction Gibbs energies were calculated at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-QZVPP//\u03c9B97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. All reactions studied here were found to be exergonic in terms of Gibbs energy. On the basis of a comparison with previous mechanistic studies, we predict that reaction a and reaction b are likely to be most important for first-generation peroxy radicals from O<sub>3</sub> oxidation (especially for \u03b2-pinene), while being less so for most first-generation peroxy radicals from OH and NO<sub>3</sub> oxidation. This is because both reactions are comparatively more exergonic for the O<sub>3</sub> oxidized systems than their OH and NO<sub>3</sub> oxidized counterparts. Our results indicate that bimolecular reactions of certain complex RO<sub>2</sub> may contribute to an increase in radical and oxidant recycling under high HO<sub>2</sub> conditions in the atmosphere, which can potentially enhance SOA formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR) , University of Helsinki , P.O.
