Daily symptoms and peak flows were recorded in populations of asthmatics, allergic individuals, those with chronic lung disease symptoms, and asymptomatic individuals (total sample size of 204) over a period of a few years. Meteorology and ambient pollutant concentrations were measured in the basin. Indoor pollutant measurements were made for particulates and CO, indicating that gas stoves and tobacco smoking were the predominant indoor sources. Time series analysis helped determine appropriate lags between environmental stimuli and health responses. Asthmatics showed that most respiratory responses while asymptomatics showed no significant responses. Outdoor ozone, nitrogen dioxide, aeroallergens and meteorology, and indoor gas stoves were significantly related, independently and interactively, with symptoms and peak flow."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lebowitz", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Collins", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holberg", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases, Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microclimate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3608936", "10.1016/s0013-9351(87)80033-6", "S0013-9351(87)80033-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
