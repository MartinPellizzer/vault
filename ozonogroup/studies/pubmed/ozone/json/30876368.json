Analysis of these spectra reveals noticeable deviations from the statistical factor of 2 for the ratio between the number of states in asymmetric and symmetric ozone molecules. It is found that, for the lower energy parts of spectra, the ratio is less than 2 in the singly substituted ozone molecules, but it is more than 2 in the doubly substituted ozone molecules. However, the upper parts of spectra, just below dissociation thresholds, exhibit a different behavior. In this energy range, the singly and doubly substituted ozone molecules behave similar, with the ratio of states in asymmetric and symmetric ozone molecules being more than 2 in both cases. This property may contribute to an explanation of the mysterious \u03b7-effect in the ozone forming reaction that favors the formation of the asymmetric ozone molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Marquette University, Wehr Chemistry Building, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000239503356"], "LastName": "Gayday", "ForeName": "Igor", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Theoretical Division (T-1, MS B221), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000260941430"], "LastName": "Teplukhin", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Marquette University, Wehr Chemistry Building, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201-1881, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000246677645"], "LastName": "Babikov", "ForeName": "Dmitri", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30876368", "10.1063/1.5082850"]}}]}
