This study was conducted to determine the effect of microbubble ozonation on changes in DOM fraction and its effect on the formation of THM4 and HAA5. Alum coagulation and activated carbon adsorption were carried out to reduce the DOM concentration before microbubble ozonation. Microbubble ozonation was carried out at acidic (pH 5.5), neutral (pH 7) and alkaline (pH 8.5) conditions to determine the effect of pH. Coagulation and adsorption of activated carbon were successful in reducing the presence of the hydrophobic acid fraction (HPOA) in peat water completely, but the transphilic (TPH), charged hydrophilic (HPIC) and neutral hydrophilic (HPIN) fractions remained in the water. Microbubble ozonation succeeded in decreasing the presence of TPH fraction but increased the formation of HPIC and HPIN. The degradation of the TPH fraction resulted in reduced formation of chlorinated THM4 and HAA5 (C-THM4 and C-HAA5). On the other hand, the formation of HPIC and HPIN fractions increased the formation of brominated THM4 and HAA5 (B-THM4 and B-HAA5) after the final chlorination process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
