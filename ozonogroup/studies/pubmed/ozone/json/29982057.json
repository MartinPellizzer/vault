A combination of anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation was proposed for methane recovery and nutrient supply from PHWW. Granular activated carbon (GAC) and ozone were used to enhance energy recovery from the PHWW. The results indicated that with GAC addition, the maximum methane yield increased by 67.7%-228\u202fmL/g\u202fCOD<sub>removal</sub>. In addition, Chlorella vulgaris displayed optimal growth in a 5-fold diluted digestate with a 2.32\u202fg/L maximum biomass content and 180\u202fmg/(L\u00b7d) biomass production rate. The total energy yield was 565\u202fkJ/g\u202fCOD, which was 27.4 times higher than that without GAC. Integration of anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation, particularly with GAC addition during fermentation, is a feasible and advantageous process for energy recovery from PHWW."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
