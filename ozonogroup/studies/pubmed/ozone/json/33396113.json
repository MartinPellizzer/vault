We examined the association of air pollution with AECOPD admissions using two-stage time-series analysis, and estimated the annual attributable fractions, numbers, and direct hospitalization costs of AECOPD admissions with principal component analysis.", "From 2013-2017, mean daily concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> declined by nearly 40%, 30%, and 26% respectively. As the average daily 8\u00a0h O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased considerably, the number of days exceeding WHO target (i.e.,100\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3) increased from 103 in 2015-152 in 2017. For each interquartile range increase in pollutant concentration, the relative risks of AECOPD admission at lag 0-3 were 1.093 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1.092 (95% CI 1.08-1.11) for O<sub>3</sub>, and 1.092 (95% CI 1.05-1.14) for SO<sub>2</sub>. Attributable fractions of AECOPD admission advanced by air pollution declined from 9.5% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2016, then increased to 6.0% in 2017. A similar declining trend was observed for direct AECOPD hospitalization costs.", "Declined attributable hospital admissions for AECOPD may be associated with the reduction in concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> in Guangdong, while O<sub>3</sub> has emerged as an important risk factor.
