Initial populations of pathogens in inoculated apple juice were approximately 10(5)-10(6) CFU ml(-1). Heat treatment alone (25, 45, 50 and 55\u00b0C) for 1 min reduced populations of E. coli O157:H7 by 0 to 4\u00b775 log CFU ml(-1) in three types of apple juice. The combination of ozone and heat treatment for 1 min at 25 and 45\u00b0C reduced E. coli O157:H7 by 0\u00b793-3\u00b787 log CFU ml(-1) and below the detection limit (>1 log CFU ml(-1)) at 50 and 55\u00b0C. A similar tendency was observed for S. Typhimurium. In several instances, results showed a synergistic effect of ozone and heat treatment.
