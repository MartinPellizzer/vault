Unlike earlier studies on pre-seismic anomalous signals, here we focus on the co-seismic changes in ocean, land, and atmospheric parameters associated with these two earthquakes. The quasi-coseismic variations have been clearly observed in ocean, atmosphere, and snow parameters from satellite and reanalysis datasets. Our results show a decline in the seawater temperature and salinity, and enhancement in the chlorophyll-a concentration in the eastern Mediterranean Sea associated with the earthquakes. Over the epicentral region, the total ozone column and snowfall have been observed to increase with the occurrence of earthquakes. After a detailed analysis of the hourly parameters (atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed), we found the atmospheric pressure variation caused by the ground motion of seismic waves is the possible reason for the co-seismic changes. Based on the results discussed in this paper, a model of multi-geosphere co-seismic response associated with the 2023 Turkey events is proposed. Additionally, our results show that the crustal motion in the high mountain region within the earthquake preparation zone could be more sensitive prior to the earthquake due to the enhancement of electric field as suggested by the theory of positive holes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
