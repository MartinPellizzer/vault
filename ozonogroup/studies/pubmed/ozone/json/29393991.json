However, there are concerns that these impact estimates might be biased due to the environmental artifacts imposed by this enclosure system. In this study, we collated O<sub>3</sub> exposure and yield data for three major crop species-wheat, rice, and soybean-for which O<sub>3</sub> experiments have been conducted with OTCs as well as the ecologically more realistic free-air O<sub>3</sub> elevation (O<sub>3</sub> -FACE) exposure system; both within the same cultivation region and country. For all three crops, we found that the sensitivity of crop yield to the O<sub>3</sub> metric AOT40 (accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> exposure above a cut-off threshold concentration of 40 ppb) significantly differed between OTC and O<sub>3</sub> -FACE experiments. In wheat and rice, O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was higher in O<sub>3</sub> -FACE than OTC experiments, while the opposite was the case for soybean. In all three crops, these differences could be linked to factors influencing stomatal conductance (manipulation of water inputs, passive chamber warming, and cultivar differences in gas exchange). Our study thus highlights the importance of accounting for factors that control stomatal O<sub>3</sub> flux when applying experimental data to assess O<sub>3</sub> impacts on crops at large spatial scales."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9775-5113"], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhaozhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uddling", "ForeName": "Johan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Haoye", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Kazuhiko", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Glob Chang Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9888746", "ISSNLinking": "1354-1013"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29393991", "10.1111/gcb.14077"]}}]}
