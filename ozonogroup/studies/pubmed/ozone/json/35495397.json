A left open distal tibial fracture (Gustilo type 3C) with a wide and contaminated soft tissues defect, that extended from the knee to the midfoot, is accompanied by wasting of the anterior compartment muscles and ruptured of the anterior tibial artery. We did irrigation and debridement and then we placed an anteriomedial external fixation system type AO with pins. A cross-leg flap and free skin grafts from the opposite limb was performed three weeks after a daily irrigation and debridement, povidon and ozone cream bandages, and antibiotics. After twelve months of follow-up, the fracture was healed and the external fixator was removed.", "Gustilo-Anderson type 3 open fractures remain a veritable orthopedic challenge, even for surgeons with greater experience, because of neurovascular damages, high amputation rate, and vast soft tissue injuries. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary surgical team led to preserve the limb with good result after one year. It is reasonable to judge and attempt a limb preservation even with wide open tibial fractures."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IJS Publishing Group Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Al Assad and Al Mouwasat University Hospitals, Damascus University- Faculty of Medicine, Damascus, Syria."}], "LastName": "Alsultan", "ForeName": "Abdullah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Al Assad and Al Mouwasat University Hospitals, Damascus University- Faculty of Medicine, Damascus, Syria."}], "LastName": "Al Masri", "ForeName": "Mohamad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Aleppo University Hospital, Aleppo, Syria."}], "LastName": "Al-Hajjaj", "ForeName": "Maher", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Damascus University- Faculty of Medicine, Khorfakkan Hospital, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Al Atrash", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, Al Assad and Al Mouwasat University Hospitals, Damascus University- Faculty of Medicine, Damascus, Syria."}], "LastName": "Alsultan", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Med Surg (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "101616869", "ISSNLinking": "2049-0801"}, "CoiStatement": "The author declares that they have no conflicts of interest regarding this study.
