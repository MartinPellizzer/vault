This study was performed to determine whether in utero exposure to TS influences the pulmonary response of newborn rat pups to ozone (O\u2083). Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to TS or air for 3 h/d from gestation d 7 through 21. The pulmonary response of pups was assessed following a single 3-h exposure to air or 0.6 ppm O\u2083 on d 13 after birth. In all, 4 exposure groups were evaluated: (1) Air/Air (in utero air and postnatal air), (2) Air/O\u2083 (in utero air and postnatal O\u2083), (3) TS/Air (in utero TS and postnatal air), and (4) TS/O\u2083 (in utero TS and postnatal O\u2083). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and BAL cells and fluid were analyzed. Data revealed a significant increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and total BALF protein in the Air/O\u2083 group compared to the Air/Air control, reflecting the inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of O\u2083. However, in utero exposure to TS attenuated PMN infiltration into the air spaces for recovery in the BAL of TS/O\u2083 pups. Lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity significantly increased only in the TS/O\u2083 group but not in Air/O\u2083 pups, thus suggesting that PMN are sequestered in the lung tissue and that the in utero TS likely inhibits O\u2083-mediated influx of PMN into the air spaces. Lung tissue analyses further showed a significant rise in manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein and a decrease in extracellular SOD protein in the Air/O\u2083 group, suggesting oxidative effects of O\u2083. Interestingly, in utero TS exposure again suppressed these effects in the TS/O\u2083 group. Overall, results suggest that in utero exposure to TS alone produced minimal acute pulmonary effects in newborn rats, but modulated adverse effects of postnatal O\u2083 exposure. The results are contrary to the interactive toxic responses predicted for sequential exposures to TS and O\u2083, and may represent the development of \"cross-tolerance.\""]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Center for Toxicology, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Sung Gu", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhoopalan", "ForeName": "Vanitha", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akinbiyi", "ForeName": "Tolulola", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gairola", "ForeName": "C Gary", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhalla", "ForeName": "Deepak K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21432716", "10.1080/15287394.2011.539133", "935259615"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
