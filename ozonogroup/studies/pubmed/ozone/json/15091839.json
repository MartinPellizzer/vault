A field study was conducted to investigate the effects of chronic O(3) exposure on kernel-growth components of two soft red winter-wheat genotypes (Seven and MD5518308). Five air-quality treatments, including charcoal-filtered air (CF), non-filtered air (NF), NF + 20, and NF + 40 and NF + 80 nl O(3) liter(-1) air were applied 4 h d(-1), 5 d wk(-1) through maturity. In the case of the NF + treatments, O(3) was added to existing ambient O(3) levels. Spike samples were collected 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 days after anthesis (DAA). Linear and quadratic equations were fitted to kernel-weight data to estimate kernel-growth rate (KGR) and kernel-fill duration (KFD). Effective filling period (EFP) and assimilate utilization (AU) were also determined. Rates of growth for individual kernels were 0.74 mg d(-1) and 1.07 mg d(-1) for the NF + 80 and CF treatments, respectively. The NF + 80 nL litter(-1) O(3) treatment significantly reduced KGR and AU compared with the CF treatment. Severn had a significantly loger KFD than MD5518308, but O(3) had no significant effect on KFD of either genotype. Each genotype had similar EFP values, and O(3) had no significant effect on EFP. Linear relationships between O(3) exposure and kernel weight suggests that O(3) effects on kernel weight begin soon after anthesis in MD5518308, but, in Severn, O(3) has a greater effect on kernel weight during the later stages of kernel development. These data suggest that decreased economic yield associated with chronic O(3) exposure is primarily the result of decreased KGR."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agronomy Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slaughter", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulchi", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091839", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90030-r", "0269-7491(93)90030-R"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
