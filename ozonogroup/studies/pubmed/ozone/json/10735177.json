Current evidence suggests that these substances induce, by the mechanism of imprinting, alterations of the differentiation of several cell-types, resulting in the development of disease during the adult age. The most known delayed effects to prenatal exposure to agents displaying hormone action, pollutants, food additives and natural food components, substances of abuse and stress by the mechanism of imprinting are described. Among them, estrogens, androgens, progestins, lead, benzopyrenes, ozone, dioxins, DDT, DDE, methoxychlor, chlordecone, parathion, malathion, polychlorobiphenyls, pyrethroids, paraquat, food additives, normal food constituents, tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine and opiates. It is concluded that perinatal exposure to several agents causes irreversible changes that determine health conditions during adulthood. Several diseases developing during adulthood probably were determined during early stages of life, under the effect of exposure or preferential mother's diet during pregnancy. Regulations to avoid these early exposures may contribute to an important improvement of health conditions of humankind."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Experimental Endocrinology and Environmental Pathology LEEPA, University of Chile, Medical School, Santiago. atcherni@machi.med.uchile.cl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tchernitchin", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tchernitchin", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mena", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Unda", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soto", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8404358", "ISSNLinking": "0236-5383"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gonadal Steroid Hormones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gonadal Steroid Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}], "NumberOfReferences": "121"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10735177"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
