In particular, we have identified and quantified nitrotriphenylenes in the airborne particulate matter extracts collected over four consecutive 6-h periods on 2 December 1999. The concentrations of 1- and 2-nitrotriphenylene ranged from 0.04 to 0.44 and from 0.02 to 0.47 ng/m3, respectively, and the concentrations in the airborne particulate matter extracts collected during the 18:00-24:00 h time period were the highest of the four collection periods. 1-Nitropyrene and 2-nitrofluoranthene were also identified and quantified in the four 6-h samples. Although the concentrations of 1- and 2-nitrotriphenylenes were not higher than that of 2-nitrofluoranthene except during the 18:00-24:00 h time period, the concentrations were much higher than that of 1-nitropyrene during the four collection periods. The higher concentrations of 1- and 2-nitrotriphenylenes during the 18:00-24:00 h time period are presumably responsible for the high reactivity of parent triphenylene with NO2/NO3/N2O5, and high stability of 1- and 2-nitrotriphenylenes toward O3 + O2. In addition, the observed isomer distribution of nitrotriphenylenes suggested that direct emission of nitrotriphenylenes is also a source as well as their atmospheric formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Chemistry and Engineering, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hisamatsu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inazu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aika", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chrysenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18WX3373I0", "NameOfSubstance": "triphenylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11482656", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00516-6", "S0045653500005166"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
