The formation of digalactosyl diglyceride and trigalactosyl diglyceride was inhibited much more than the formation of monogalactosyl diglyceride, steryl glycoside, and acylated steryl glycoside. Essentially identical results were obtained when glycolipid synthesis was inhibited by N-ethyl maleimide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and CdCl(2). Iodoacetate and iodoacetamide affected neither the total incorporation of sugar from uridine 5'-pyrophosphate-galactose nor distribution of the incorporated sugar in the various glycolipids.Ozone reacted with model membrane systems prepared with egg lecithin. In the absence of reduced glutathione, products included malonaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of glutathione, malonaldehyde was still produced, but the glutathione was oxidized and no peroxide was detected. When these studies were extended to chloroplast preparations, it was also found that malonaldehyde was produced and glutathione was oxidized.It was concluded that ozone inhibits glycolipid biosynthesis in chloroplast preparations by way of oxidation of enzyme sulfhydryl groups but that this reaction may be a secondary effect of oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California 92502."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mudd", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McManus", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ongun", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCullogh", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Can J Biochem Physiol. 1959 Aug;37(8):911-7", "ArticleIdList": ["13671378"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1959 May;82(1):70-7", "ArticleIdList": ["13650640"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1962 Aug;98:253-61", "ArticleIdList": ["13883105"]}, {"Citation": "J Lipid Res. 1969 Nov;10(6):623-30", "ArticleIdList": ["5348119"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1966 Dec 28;130(2):528-31", "ArticleIdList": ["5972863"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1970 Aug 7;169(3945):605-6", "ArticleIdList": ["5426783"]}, {"Citation": "Atmos Environ. 1969 Nov;3(6):669-82", "ArticleIdList": ["5382204"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1970 Jul;66(3):909-16", "ArticleIdList": ["4316683"]}, {"Citation": "J Lipid Res. 1967 Sep;8(5):417-28", "ArticleIdList": ["4860576"]}, {"Citation": "Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem. 1965;342(1):73-80", "ArticleIdList": ["5875622"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1963 Apr 2;11:60-4", "ArticleIdList": ["13969161"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1964;14:503-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5836548"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1949 Jan;24(1):1-15", "ArticleIdList": ["16654194"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1969 Jul;8(7):2827-32", "ArticleIdList": ["5808335"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1970 Apr;45(4):517-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5427124"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Phys Lipids. 1969 Sep;3(3):221-33", "ArticleIdList": ["5348061"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1968 Apr 10;243(7):1558-66", "ArticleIdList": ["5647271"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem. 1949 Dec;24(2):305-13", "ArticleIdList": ["15405719"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Oil Chem Soc. 1966 May;43(5):265-70", "ArticleIdList": ["5933460"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1969 Sep 25;244(18):4899-903", "ArticleIdList": ["5824565"]}, {"Citation": "Phytopathology. 1969 Sep;59(9):1284-6", "ArticleIdList": ["5820899"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1969 Nov;115(2):335-9", "ArticleIdList": ["5378384"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1971", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1971", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1971", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1972", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16657793", "PMC396861", "10.1104/pp.48.3.335"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
