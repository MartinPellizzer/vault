While oxidative stress is critical for their effects, the precise mechanisms, including chemical mediators, remain obscure. Previously, we reported that air plasma-activated medium (APAM) exhibited tumor-selective anticancer activity. The fragmentation of mitochondria and their asymmetrical assembly around the peripheral regions of the damaged nucleus, namely, monopolar perinuclear mitochondrial clustering (MPMC), proceed to the effect. Subsequently, we found that APAM had a substantial amount of O<sub>3</sub> in addition to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), nitrile (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). In the present study, we investigated the possible role of O<sub>3</sub> in the anticancer effect. For this purpose, we created a nitrogen oxide-free ozonated medium ODM. ODM exhibited potent cytotoxicity against various cancer but not nonmalignant cells. ODM also increased MPMC, hydroxyl radicals, lipid peroxides, and their shifts to perinuclear sites in cancer cells. Catalase and iron chelation prevented these events and cytotoxicity. ODM also decreases the intracellular labile irons while increasing those within mitochondria. ODM had substantial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> but this oxidant failed to cause MPMC and cytotoxicity. These results show that ODM can mimic the effects of APAM, including MPMC and tumor-selective anticancer effects. The findings suggest that O<sub>3</sub> is critical in mediating the anticancer effects of APAM by triggering oxidative cell death caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and iron."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
