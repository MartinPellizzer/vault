In this manuscript, we report on the influence of surface treatment of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and electron transport layer (ETL), ZnO, on the photovoltaic performance of inverted organic solar cells (IOSC) and their correlation with the surface chemistry and surface potential as studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), using the device structure glass/ITO/ZnO/P3HT: PCBM/MoO3/(Au or Ag) (P3HT, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), and PCBM, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester). Our results show that although ozonization of ITO leads to an improvement in the device power conversion efficiency, the ozonization of a subsequent ZnO layer results in a decreased performance mainly because of a decrease in the fill factor (FF). However, subsequent methanol (CH3OH) treatment of ZnO layer on an ozonized ITO electrode shows substantial improvement with device efficiencies exceeding \u223c4% along with superior reproducibility of the devices. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the surface wettability, chemistry, and surface potential using contact angle measurements, XPS, and KPFM attribute the improvements to the elimination of surface defects and the changes in the surface potential. Finally, impedance analysis suggests that methanol treatment of the ZnO layers leads to the development of a favorable nanophase structure with higher conductivity, which is otherwise indiscernible using microscopic methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Materials Science and Engineering and \u2021Samtel Center for Display Technologies, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Shailendra Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Materials Science and Engineering and \u2021Samtel Center for Display Technologies, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India."}], "LastName": "Jindal", "ForeName": "Rajeev", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Materials Science and Engineering and \u2021Samtel Center for Display Technologies, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26158508", "10.1021/acsami.5b03583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
