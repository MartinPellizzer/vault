The morning 'rush-hour' peak was mainly due to vehicle emissions, while the late evening peak was mainly attributed to meteorological conditions, particularly atmospheric stability and wind speed. Total suspended particulate matter was the main pollutant with its concentrations at few sites often exceeding the Recommended Malaysia Air Quality Guidelines. The levels of other pollutants were generally within the guidelines. Since 1980, six major haze episodes were officially reported in Malaysia: April 1983, August 1990, June 1991, October 1991, August to October 1994, and July to October 1997. The 1997 haze episode was the worst ever experienced by the country. Short-term observations using continuous monitoring systems during the haze episodes during these periods clearly showed that suspended particulate matter (PM10) was the main cause of haze and was transboundary in nature. Large forest fires in parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan during the haze period, clearly evident in satellite images, were identified as the probable key sources of the widespread heavy haze that extended across Southeast Asia from Indonesia to Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. The results of several studies have also provided strong evidence that biomass burning is the dominating source of particulate matter. The severity and extent of 1997's haze pollution was unprecedented, affecting some 300 million people across the region. The amount of economic costs suffered by Southeast Asian countries during this environmental disaster was enormous and is yet to be fully determined. Among the important sectors severely affected were air and land transport, shipping, construction, tourism and agro-based industries. The economic cost of the haze-related damage to Malaysia presented in this study include short-term health costs, production losses, tourism-related losses and the cost of avertive action. Although the cost reported here is likely to be underestimated, they are nevertheless significant (roughly RM1 billion).", "The general air quality of Malaysia since 1970 has deteriorated. Studies have shown that should no effective countermeasures be introduced, the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the year 2005 would increase by 1.4, 2.12, 1.47 and 2.27 times, respectively, from the 1992 levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Environmental Technology and Natural Resource Management, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor. awang@fsas.upm.edu.my"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Awang", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaafar", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdullah", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdullah", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Noor", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Respirology", "NlmUniqueID": "9616368", "ISSNLinking": "1323-7799"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smoke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoke"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10894109", "10.1046/j.1440-1843.2000.00248.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
