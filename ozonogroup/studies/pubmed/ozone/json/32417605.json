To evaluate the removal efficiency of NO and SO<sub>2</sub> using O<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, the consumption of two reactants (O<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>) in line with the conversion of NO and SO<sub>2</sub> was quantified experimentally. In addition, NO and SO<sub>2</sub> were converted to valuable fertilizers, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. To identify a principle strategy to enhance the generation of fertilizer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the reaction mechanisms for the formation of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Acceleration of SO<sub>2</sub> oxidation could be achieved effectively by adding NO to a gas mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>. The formation of HNO<sub>3</sub> might be enhanced by the simultaneous feeding of NO and SO<sub>2</sub>. Particle generation was also 10 times higher for NH<sub>3</sub>/(NO\u202f+\u202fSO<sub>2</sub>) than for NH<sub>3</sub>/NO and for NH<sub>3</sub>/SO<sub>2</sub>, which is a prominent feature of this study. Moreover, the introduction of steam had a positive influence on particle generation. This method offers dual applications for NO and SO<sub>2</sub> removal from a flue gas stream and direct fertilizer generation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
