NO<sub>X</sub> emissions from croplands are subject to being underestimated or overlooked in air pollution simulations of regional atmospheric chemistry models. With constraints of ground and space observations of NO<sub>2</sub>, the WRF-Chem model is used to investigate the cropland NO<sub>X</sub> emission and its contribution to the near-surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution in North China Plain (NCP) during a growing season as a case study. Model simulations have revealed that the cropland NO<sub>X</sub> emissions are underestimated by around 80% without constraints of satellite measured NO<sub>2</sub> column densities. The biogenic NO<sub>X</sub> source is estimated to account for half of the anthropogenic NO<sub>X</sub> emissions in the NCP during the growing season. Additionally, the cropland NO<sub>X</sub> source contributes around 5.0% of the maximum daily average 8h O<sub>3</sub> concentration and 27.7% of NO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the NCP. Our results suggest the agriculture NO<sub>X</sub> emission exerts non-negligible impacts on the summertime air quality and needs to be considered when designing emission abatement strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
