Mitigation of these emissions is warranted since N(2)O is a strong greenhouse gas and important ozone-depleting compound. Until now, only physicochemical technologies have been applied to mitigate point sources of N(2)O, and no biological treatment technology has been developed so far. In this study, a bioelectrochemical system (BES) with an autotrophic denitrifying biocathode was considered for the removal of N(2)O. The high N(2)O removal rates obtained ranged between 0.76 and 1.83 kg N m(-3) net cathodic compartment (NCC) d(-1) and were proportional to the current production, resulting in cathodic coulombic efficiencies near 100%. Furthermore, our experiments suggested the active involvement of microorganisms as the catalyst for the reduction of N(2)O to N(2), and the optimal cathode potential ranged from -200 to 0 mV vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) in order to obtain high conversion rates. Successful operation of the system for more than 115 days with N(2)O as the sole cathodic electron acceptor strongly indicated that N(2)O respiration yielded enough energy to maintain the biological process. To our knowledge, this study provides for the first time proof of concept of biocathodic N(2)O removal at long-term without the need for high temperatures and expensive catalysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Microbial Ecology and Technology (LabMET), Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Gent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Desloover", "ForeName": "Joachim", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puig", "ForeName": "Sebasti\u00e0", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Virdis", "ForeName": "Bernardino", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clauwaert", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boeckx", "ForeName": "Pascal", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verstraete", "ForeName": "Willy", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boon", "ForeName": "Nico", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22070656", "10.1021/es202047x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
