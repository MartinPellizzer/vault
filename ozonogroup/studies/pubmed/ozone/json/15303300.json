Bench-scale reactors were constructed to operate in a manner analogous to a commercially available system manufactured by Terr-Aqua Environmental Systems (only with longer contact time). The GAC system consisted of two GAC biofilter beds that operated in a cyclical manner. On a given day, the first GAC bed adsorbed methyl isobutyl ketone from a simulated waste airstream, while the second bed underwent regeneration; then on the next day, the second bed was in the adsorption mode while the first was regenerated. Three bench-scale systems were used to compare the performance under three operating conditions: (1) ozone/ associated oxidant regeneration of a GAC biofilter system that was seeded with microorganisms from a field site, (2) a humid air regeneration of a seeded GAC biofilter, and (3) a humid air regeneration of an unseeded GAC biofilter. For the advanced oxidant regenerated GAC biofilter, a maximum removal efficiency of >95% was achieved with an empty bed contact time of 148 sec and an influent concentration of 125 ppm methyl isobutyl ketone, and 90-95% was achieved at 148-sec empty bed contact time and a 1150-ppm influent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Army TACOM-TARDEC, Warren, Michigan, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dusenbury", "ForeName": "James S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cannon", "ForeName": "Fred S", "Initials": "FS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15303300", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470947"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
