However, there is limited information about the level of lysis or changes in cell properties after ozonation, release of intracellular compounds and their contribution to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). This study aims to: (1) assess the extent of the pre-ozonation effects on CB cell properties; (2) determine the CT (ozone concentration \u00d7 detention time) values required for complete loss of cell viability; and (3) study the DBPs formation associated with the pre-ozonation of cyanobacterial cells in laboratorial suspensions. To these ends, both Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena flos-aquae suspensions were prepared at concentrations of 250,000 cells mL(-1) and 1,500,000 cells mL(-1) and were subjected to ozone dosages of 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 mg L(-1) at pH 6 and pH 8. A quick and complete loss of viability was achieved for both CB species after exposure (CT) to ozone of <0.2 mg min L(-1), although no significant decrease in total cell numbers was observed. Maximum dissolved organic carbon (DOC) releases of 0.96 mg L(-1) and 1.63 mg L(-1) were measured after ozonation of 250,000 cells mL(-1) of M. aeruginosa and A. flos-aquae, respectively. DOC release was found to be pH and ozone dose dependent. Ozonation of CB cells increased formation of trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA), mainly for suspensions of A. flos-aquae at pH 8 (by 174% and 65% for THM and HAA respectively). Utilities considering using ozone for oxidising CB cells should weigh out the benefit of CB control with the potential increased formation of chlorinated DBPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
