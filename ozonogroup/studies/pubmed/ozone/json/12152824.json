Statistical models were developed to estimate stomatal conductance (gs) of 40-year-old ponderosa pine at three sites differing in pollutant exposure for the purpose of calculating O3 uptake. Gs was estimated using julian day, hour of day, pre-dawn xylem potential and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). The median difference between estimated and observed field gs did not exceed 10 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1), and estimated gs within 95% confidence intervals. 03 uptake was calculated from hourly estimated gs, hourly O3 concentration, and a constant to correct for the difference in diffusivity between water vapor and 03. The simulation model TREGRO was also used to calculate the cumulative 03 uptake at all three sites. 03 uptake estimated by the statistical model was higher than that simulated by TREGRO because gas exchange rates were proportionally higher. O3 exposure and uptake were significantly correlated (r2>0.92), because O3 exposure and gs were highly correlated in both statistical and simulation models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, Riverside, CA 92507, USA. ngrulke@deltanet.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grulke", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Preisler", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Retzlaff", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12152824", "10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00338-4", "S0269-7491(01)00338-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
