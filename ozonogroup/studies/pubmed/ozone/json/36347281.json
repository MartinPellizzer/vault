At present, there are many studies on the conventional gaseous pollutants and particulate matter of NG vehicles, but very few studies on their VOCs. In this study, the chassis dynamometer is used to test CNG/E10 bi-fuel light-duty vehicles, analyze the advantages of CNG in CO<sub>2</sub>, fuel thermal efficiency, and cost, and discuss its disadvantages in NO<sub>x</sub> emission. Most importantly, the emission characteristics and ozone formation potential of VOCs in the exhaust of CNG vehicles were analyzed in the study. Compared with E10, CNG fuel can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission by about 20 %, improve thermal efficiency by about 13 %, and save fuel costs by about 50 %. However, it will increase NO<sub>x</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> emissions by about 10 % and 13 % respectively. As for VOCs, the emission factor of VOCs from CNG fuel is about 54 % of E10 fuel. The VOCs group with the highest proportion in the exhaust of CNG-fueled vehicles is alkanes, >80 %. while the alkanes and alkenes with the highest proportion in E10 fuel are 30 % and 23 % respectively. C2 VOCs emitted by CNG account for >70 %, while C2 VOCs emitted by E10 are <60 %, followed by C4 VOCs, about 10 % - 30 %. The OFPs of VOCs in CNG exhaust is about 13.7 % of E10. Alkenes contribute the most to ozone, and the OFPs of alkenes in CNG and E10 vehicle exhaust accounts for about 55.3 % and 78.8 % of TVOCs respectively. The results of this study are helpful to improve people's understanding of the environmental value of using NG vehicles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
