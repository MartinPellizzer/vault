Group 1 was accepted as the control group, Group 2 received intramuscular 20\u2009mg/kg methylprednisolone acetate and Group 3 received 14 sessions of ozone treatment in addition to methylprednisolone acetate. The subjects were sacrificed on the 30<sup>th</sup> day. Retinal tissues were removed. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels were evaluated for tissue biochemistry and serum ischaemic modified albumin (IMA), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels were evaluated with the ELISA method. Haematoxylin-eosin staining and TUNEL evaluation for apoptosis were evaluated as histopathological methods.", "In the treatment group, antioxidant parameters of TAS, SOD and CAT were higher, oxidative and ischaemic parameters of MDA, TOS and IMA were lower, inflammatory parameters of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were lower, retinal thickness was better and apoptosis amount was lower.", "Apoptosis increases in retinal tissues due to high dose systemic steroid administration and the retina becomes thinner. With biochemical examination, oxidation parameters increased while antioxidant parameters decreased. Both histopathological and biochemical parameters improved significantly with ozone treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, \u00c7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, \u00c7anakkale, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "ForeName": "Ayd\u0131n", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4436-9160"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, \u00c7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, \u00c7anakkale, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u015eehito\u011flu", "ForeName": "M\u00fc\u015ferref Hilal", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6708-1229"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency and Disaster Management, Health School, Nam\u0131k Kemal University, Tekirda\u011f, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karabo\u011fa", "ForeName": "\u0130hsan", "Initials": "\u0130"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, \u00c7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, \u00c7anakkale, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ar\u0131kan", "ForeName": "Sedat", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cutan Ocul Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101266892", "ISSNLinking": "1556-9527"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ischemia-modified albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "43502P7F0P", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylprednisolone Acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ZIF514RVZR", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin, Human"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Cutan Ocul Toxicol. 2024 Jun;43(2):148. doi: 10.1080/15569527.2024.2343978", "PMID": "38695323"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Methylprednisolone Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Retina"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Retinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32619116", "10.1080/15569527.2020.1790590"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
