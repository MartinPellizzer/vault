Ozone-sensitive and tolerant pollen populations have been identified in tobacco, petunia, and tomato cultivars. The rate of tube elongation can be reversibly slowed or stopped by exposure to low concentrations of ozone. Tube growth rates in the presence of a range of ozone dosages, of pollen populations exhibiting differing ozone sensitivity can be measured and different growth rates can be correlated with ozone dosages. The performance of selected pollen populations can then be used to bioassay ozone in ambient air by introducing the air sample into a growth chamber where ozone-sensitive pollen in growing. Petunia and tobacco pollen are especially useful because they store well at ordinary freezer temperatures and do not require special preparation prior to storage. Modified Brewbacker's growth medium is suitable for growth of both these pollen types. Four useful cultivars are Bel W-3, ozone-sensitive and Bel B, ozone-tolerant tobacco, and White Bountiful, ozone-sensitive and Blue Lagoon, ozone-tolerant petunia. Observations can be made directly by using a TV scanner, or by time lapse or interval photography. Year-round pollen production can be achieved in the greenhouse. Harvested pollen can be tested, packaged, and transported to user facilities without loss of vigor. Pollen populations are inexpensive to produce, respond reliably, and are simple to use as a bioassay for air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feder", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Morphogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1968 Jun 7;160(3832):1122", "ArticleIdList": ["5647434"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1978 Dec;27:139-47", "ArticleIdList": ["738233"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1972 Jun;49(6):924-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16658085"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7460876", "PMC1568650", "10.1289/ehp.8137117"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
