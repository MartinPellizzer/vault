Our study identified temporal and spatial variations in asthma hospitalization across the study region and explored the combined effect of exposure to ambient ozone and air toxics on asthma hospitalization. Asthma hospitalization hot spots and clusters were mostly not located on zip codes with reported high quantities of total air releases of chemical pollutants. There was no significant interaction between ambient ozone exposure and toxic air releases relative to asthma hospitalization. The major predictor of asthma hospitalization was season, with hospitalization rate per 10,000 people for asthma being highest in winter period when ozone levels are usually lowest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nnoli", "ForeName": "Nnamdi C", "Initials": "NC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Management Policy and Community Health, School of Public Health , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Health Policy, School of Public Health , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linder", "ForeName": "Stephen H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Mary A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Management Policy and Community Health, School of Public Health , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gemeinhardt", "ForeName": "Gretchen L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health , The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , Houston , Texas , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hazardous Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hazardous Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29962221", "10.1080/09603123.2018.1479515"]}}]}
