In this study, two lab-scale continuous-operating activated sludge treatment systems were established: one was operated in conjunction with ozonation for excess sludge reduction, and the other was operated under normal conditions as control. The results indicate that an ozone dose of 100 mg O\u2083 g(-1)SS led to a zero yield of excess sludge in the sludge-reduction system during a continuous-operating period of 45d. Although ozonation gave a relatively lower specific oxygen uptake rate of activated sludge, it had little effect on the system's removal performance of COD and nitrogen substances. As a plus, sludge ozonation contributed a little more removal of target EDCs (estrone, 17\u03b2-estrodiol, estriol, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, and 4-nonylphenol). However, the total phosphorus removal declined notably due to its accumulation in the sludge-reduction system, which necessitates phosphorus recovery for the activated sludge process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
