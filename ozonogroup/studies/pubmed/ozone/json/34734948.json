The current work aimed to quantify the changes due to the lockdown in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in two contrasting cities in India (Delhi and Hyderabad) using a boosted regression tree model to account for the influence of meteorology. The median NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were observed to decrease after lockdown in both cities, up to 57% and 75% for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, respectively when compared to previous years. After normalization due to meteorology the calculated reduction after lockdown for PM<sub>2.5</sub> was small (<8%) in both cities, and was likely less attributable to changes in local emissions, but rather due changes in background levels (<i>i.e.</i> regional source(s)). The reduction of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> due to lockdown varied by site (on average 5-30%), likely reflecting differences in relative proximity of local sources to the monitoring site, demonstrating the key influence of meteorology on ambient levels post-lockdown. Ozone was observed to increase after lockdown at both sites in Delhi, likely due to changes in relative amounts of precursor concentrations promoting ozone production, suggesting a volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regime in Delhi. Thus, the calculated reduction in air pollutants due to lockdown in the current work cannot be extrapolated to be solely from a reduction in emissions and instead reflects the overall change in ambient levels, as meteorology and atmospheric chemical processes also contributed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2268-9956"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada. lcrilley@yorku.ca."}], "LastName": "Crilley", "ForeName": "Leigh R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada. lcrilley@yorku.ca."}], "LastName": "Iranpour", "ForeName": "Yashar E", "Initials": "YE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6908-5829"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada. lcrilley@yorku.ca."}], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "Cora J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34734948", "10.1039/d1em00187f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
