Plants were subjected to ambient and elevated (ambient+20 ppb) O<sub>3</sub> along with three doses of biochar (0%, 2.5%, and 5%). Elevated ozone alone reduced most of the growth parameters, negatively affecting the test cultivar's physiology. Although enzymatic antioxidants were up-regulated by elevated O<sub>3</sub>, damage to the membrane integrity was evident by higher MDA content in the wheat leaves. Besides, the uptake of nutrients was observed to be reduced under elevated O<sub>3</sub> due to the reduced phyto-availability of the soil's nutrients and cation exchange capacity. Such limitation of assimilates and nutrients marked a trade-off between growth and defence, translating to grain yield loss. However, applying biochar as a soil conditioner ameliorated the detrimental effects of O<sub>3</sub> with respect to the economic yield of wheat. Biochar alone improved soil properties and nutrient phyto-availability, which translated to better plant growth, stronger physiological capacity, and higher crop productivity. Thus, the study inferred that altered nutrient phyto-availablity and its uptake, likely associated with biochar-induced improved soil properties, relayed stronger plant physiology and antioxidative defence system to combat O<sub>3</sub> induced oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
