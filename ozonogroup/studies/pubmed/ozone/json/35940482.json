The multiplicative model has been argued to perform better for leaf-level and regional-level application. In this study, we demonstrate that the photosynthetic model is superior to the multiplicative model even for leaf-level studies using measurements performed on Mangifera indica. We find that the multiplicative model overestimates the daytime stomatal conductance, when compared with measured stomatal conductance and prescribes zero conductance at night while measurements show an average conductance of 100\u00a0mmol(H<sub>2</sub>O)m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. The daytime overestimation of the multiplicative model can be significantly reduced when the model is modified to include a response function for ozone-induced stomatal closure. However, nighttime pollutant uptake fluxes can only be accurately assessed with the photosynthetic model which includes the stomatal opening at night during respiration and is capable of reproducing the measured nighttime stomatal conductance. At our site, the nocturnal flux contributes 64%, 39%, 46%, and 88% of the total for NO<sub>2</sub> uptake in winter, summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon, respectively. For SO<sub>2,</sub> nocturnal uptake amounts to 35%, 28%, 28%, and 44% in winter, summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon, respectively while for ozone the nighttime uptake contributes 30%, 17%, 18%, and 29% of the total stomatal uptake in winter, summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
