As a consequence, inhaled ozone produces diffuse inflammation of the airways, combined with an obstructive ventilatory impairment and long-lasting bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In physiopathological terms, the features observed reflect the characteristics of an asthmatic airway reaction. Thus, ozone seems to be a potential trigger of newly generated asthma in healthy persons and, in addition, may deteriorate the course of the disease in patients with preexisting asthma. The damage induced by ozone depends on the concentration as well as on the amount of inhaled pollutants. According to the duration and the physical activities during ozone-exposure, slight lung function defects have been demonstrated even at concentrations up to 120 micrograms/m3 (60 ppb). Long-term effects of ozone on human health are not yet fully explored; however, the results of a few epidemiological studies give strong evidence of harmful effects by repeated or chronic exposure to photochemical oxidants. So far an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and deterioration of lung function could be demonstrated in populations living in areas of high atmospheric pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pneumologische Abteilung Klinik Barmelweid, Aarau."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Asthma und Ozon."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax", "NlmUniqueID": "8403202", "ISSNLinking": "1013-2058"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1439419"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
