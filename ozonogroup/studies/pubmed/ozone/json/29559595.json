After culture overnight, 21 bacterial monoclones with the same diameter were selected and divided into 3 groups: A negative control group, a baseoil (camellia oil) group and an ozonated camellia oil group. We used a ring to isolate the single clone and added oil inside the ring, cultured the whole plate over night, picked out each single clone (with gel) to 5 mL LB medium and cultured it for 12 h. The final concentration of the LB medium was detected by plate count method and turbidimetry.\u2029 Results: According to the plate count method and turbidimetry, the bacterial concentration in the ozonated camellia oil group was lower than that in the negative control group and base oil group (P<0.001).\u2029 Conclusion: Bacterial monoclone culture method shows that ozonated camellia oil can significantly kill Staphylococcus aureus, and this method is an effective method for evaluating the bactericidal function of the oiling agent in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Yaping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jianyun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Feifeng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Caifeng", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Zhibing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban", "NlmUniqueID": "101230586", "ISSNLinking": "1672-7347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camellia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29559595", "10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2018.02.005"]}}]}
