The mineralization and partial chemical oxidation rates of SPRW using these metal oxides are in the same order of magnitude, and the catalytic activity in the mineralization of SPRW decreased in the order Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3\u2009</sub>><sub>\u2009</sub>CeO<sub>2\u2009</sub>>\u2009FeOOH. The mineralized fraction progressively increased with time in the catalytic process while in the non-catalytic process it remained constant. The effect of the operational conditions on the mineralization and partial chemical oxidation rates using Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was investigated in detail. The mineralization rate was found to be lower than the partial oxidation rate due to the formation of partially oxidized by-products, and this is dependent on the solids dosage and pH. An investigation of the mechanism demonstrated that the enhancement effect could be attributed to the introduction of the manganese oxide nanoparticles, which could promote the utilization of O<sub>3</sub> and/or enhance the formation of free radicals (\u2022OH, \u2022O<sub>2</sub>H and \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) on the solid surface and further accelerate the degradation of the organic compounds present in the wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Energy and the Environment Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering , Federal University of Santa Catarina , Florian\u00f3polis , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Centuri\u00e3o", "ForeName": "A P S L", "Initials": "APSL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Energy and the Environment Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering , Federal University of Santa Catarina , Florian\u00f3polis , Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldissarelli", "ForeName": "V Z", "Initials": "VZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Energy and the Environment Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering , Federal University of Santa Catarina , Florian\u00f3polis , Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1992-2916"], "LastName": "Scaratti", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Energy and the Environment Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering , Federal University of Santa Catarina , Florian\u00f3polis , Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4519-5641"], "LastName": "de Amorim", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Energy and the Environment Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering , Federal University of Santa Catarina , Florian\u00f3polis , Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2863-7260"], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "R F P M", "Initials": "RFPM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29267135", "10.1080/09593330.2017.1420103"]}}]}
