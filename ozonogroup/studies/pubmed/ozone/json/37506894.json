The footprints of total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a conventional activated sludge WWTP during 12 consecutive months were clarified. It was found that TC, FC and E.coli in influent were significantly removed (log 4.71, log 4.43 and log 4.62, respectively) by WWTP with sand filtration playing a key role, and excess sludge was a major potential pathway for them flowing to the environment. Through quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), hand-to-mouth ingestion of untreated wastewater and wastewater in secondary/efficient sedimentation tanks, as well as accidental ingestion of sludge in dewatering workshop presented the highest infection risks of pathogenic E.coli in the WWTP, considerably exceeded the U.S. EPA benchmark (\u22641\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> pppy). PPE application and E.coli concentration reduction in wastewater or sludge were recommended to reduce the infection risks at these stages. Further, partial ozonation and dissolved ozone flotation thickening were investigated able to reduce the infection risks at the stages of secondary and tertiary treatment of wastewater or sludge treatment by 90-\u00a098\u00a0%. The findings of this study would assist in selecting appropriate processes for the further sanitation of WWTPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
