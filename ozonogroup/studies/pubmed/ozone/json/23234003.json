Results showed that ozone could be thoroughly decomposed (removal rate was maintaining 100% all along the process studied) for 5 h under the condition of O3 12.89 mg x min(-1), 18 mm diameter glass tube was stuffed by activated carbon (made from coal, 2.0-2.5 mm diameter). The temperature of ODP was found rise during the treatment. The temperature became stable after quickly rise to 65-69 degrees C; and the CO2 output reduced with the stable temperature. The mechanisms of ozone decomposition were found including three parts. The first is catalytic decomposition by AC. AC enriches O3 and enhances O3 decomposition to form O2. The second is AC reaction with O3, which leads to destruction of the surface structure or group and output of CO2 and NOx are released with offgas. The third is temperature rising caused by heat production of CO2 and NOx formation according to the above two mechanisms, which enhances O3 thermal decomposition. Meanwhile, some basic design principles of ozone decomposition device were discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Sciences and Resources, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China. hlliu827@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Long", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Ye", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Ming", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Ru-Yuan", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui-Jun", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23234003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
