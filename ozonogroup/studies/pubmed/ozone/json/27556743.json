The rate coefficients determined using relative rate methods were kTHF+Cl = (1.96 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10(-10), kTHF+OD = (1.81 \u00b1 0.27) \u00d7 10(-11), kTHF+O3 = (6.41 \u00b1 2.90) \u00d7 10(-21), k2-MTHF+Cl = (2.65 \u00b1 0.43) \u00d7 10(-10), k2-MTHF+OD = (2.41 \u00b1 0.51) \u00d7 10(-11), k2-MTHF+O3 = (1.87 \u00b1 0.82) \u00d7 10(-20), k2,5-DMTHF+OD = (4.56 \u00b1 0.68) \u00d7 10(-11), k2,5-DMTHF+Cl = (2.84 \u00b1 0.34) \u00d7 10(-10), k2,5-DMTHF+O3 = (4.58 \u00b1 2.18), kfuran+Cl = (2.39 \u00b1 0.27) \u00d7 10(-10), and kfuran+O3 = (2.60 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10(-18) molecules cm(-3) s(-1). Rate coefficients of the reactions with ozone were also determined using the absolute rate method under pseudo-first-order conditions. OD radicals, in place of OH radicals, were produced from CD3ONO to avoid spectral overlap of isopropyl and methyl nitrite with the reactants. The kinetics of OD radical reactions are expected to resemble the kinetics of OH radical reactions, and the rate coefficients of the reactions with OD radicals were used to calculate the atmospheric lifetimes with respect to reactions with OH radicals. The lifetimes of THF, 2-MTHF, and 2,5-DMTHF are approximately 15, 12, and 6 h, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Copenhagen Center for Atmospheric Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen , Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "Christina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Copenhagen Center for Atmospheric Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen , Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Nielsen", "ForeName": "Ole John", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Copenhagen Center for Atmospheric Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen , Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "LastName": "\u00d8sterstr\u00f8m", "ForeName": "Freja F", "Initials": "FF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Physics, Lund University , Professorgatan 1 SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Ausmeel", "ForeName": "Stina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Physics, Lund University , Professorgatan 1 SE-221 00, Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Nilsson", "ForeName": "Elna J K", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Copenhagen Center for Atmospheric Research, Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen , Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, California State University Northridge , 18111 Nordhoff Street, Northridge, California 91330-8262, United States."}], "LastName": "Sulbaek Andersen", "ForeName": "Mads P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27556743", "10.1021/acs.jpca.6b06618"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
