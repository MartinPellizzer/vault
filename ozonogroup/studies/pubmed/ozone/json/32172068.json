More dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and disinfection by-products (DBPs) precursors were removed, meanwhile, less microbes, less metabolites and smaller microbial clusters were detected in the effluent of CAC compared with GAC. Sequentially, lower DBPs formation and higher disinfection efficiency were achieved in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). Furthermore, it was observed that extracellular electron transfer was enhanced in the attached biofilms of CAC, hence improving the microbial metabolic activity and biological removal of DOC. The results were attributed to the strong interaction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) with highly graphitized CAC. In addition, CAC resulted in totally different EPS in attached biofilms with superior characteristics including stronger viscosity, higher flocculating efficiency, mechanical stability and numerous binding sites for bacterial cells. Consequently, a wide range of compact interconnected biofilms formed on the surface of CAC and exhibited certain binding effect for microbial flocs and metabolites. Therefore, CAC resulted in higher microbial metabolic activity and lower release of microbes and metabolites, which was beneficial to maintain water quality safety in downstream DWDSs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
