To minimize the risk of exposure, the removal of these drugs from work environments, such as compounding facilities, has been recommended. In our previous paper, the degradation and inactivation efficacy of ozone water, which is being introduced into Japanese hospitals as a chemical decontamination agent, was reported for its effects on typical antineoplastic drugs (gemcitabine, irinotecan, paclitaxel). This article aims to further investigate the efficacy of ozone water for eight antineoplastic drugs to clarify its application limitations. A small amount (medicinal ingredient: typically ca. 1.5 \u03bcmol) of formulation containing 5-fluorouracil, pemetrexed, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, or docetaxel was mixed with 50 mL of ozone water (~8 mg/L), and the resulting solutions were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography over time to observe the degradation. Consequently, the ozonation was overall effective for the degradation of the drugs, however this varied depending on the chemical structures of the drugs and additives in their formulations. In addition, after the parent drugs were completely degraded by the ozonation, the degradation mixtures were subjected to 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and evaluated for mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium strains and cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. The degradation mixtures of cisplatin and ifosfamide were mutagenic while those of the other drugs were non-mutagenic. Further, the ozonation resulted in clear decreases of cytotoxicity for 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin, but increases of cytotoxicity for pemetrexed, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide. These results suggest that the ozone water should be restrictedly used according to the situation of contamination in clinical settings because the ozonation enhances toxicity depending on the drug even if degradation is achieved."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
