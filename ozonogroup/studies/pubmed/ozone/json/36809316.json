However, some VOCs such as benzene are highly carcinogenic, while others such as ethylene and propylene may cause secondary air pollution, owing to their high ozone-generating ability. Accordingly, the US EPA(United State, Environment Protect Agency) introduced a fenceline monitoring system that regulates the concentration of VOCs at the boundary of a facility, away from the chimney source. This system was first introduced in the petroleum refining industry, which simultaneously emits benzene, affecting the local community because of its high carcinogenicity, and ethylene, propylene, xylene, and toluene, which have a high photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). These emissions contribute to air pollution. In Korea, the concentration at the chimney is regulated; however, the concentration at the plant boundary is not considered. In accordance with the EPA regulations, Korea's petroleum refining industries were identified and the limitations of the Clean Air Conservation Act were studied. The average concentration of benzene at the research facility examined in this study was 8.53\u2009\u00b5g/m3, which complied with the benzene action level of 9\u2009\u00b5g/m3. However, this value was exceeded at some points along the fenceline, in proximity to the benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) manufacturing process. The composition ratios of toluene and xylene were 27% and 16%, respectively, which were higher than those of ethylene or propylene. These results suggest that reduction measures in the BTX manufacturing process are necessary. This study shows that legal regulations should enforce reduction measures through continuous monitoring at the fenceline of petroleum refineries in Korea.<i>Implications</i>: Although volatile organic compounds(VOCs) are essential in various industrial sites, they adversely affect the health of people in the near community. Benzene is highly carcinogenic, so it is dangerous if exposed continuously. In addition, there are various types of VOCs, which combine with atmospheric ozone to generate smog. Globally, VOCs are managed as Total VOCs. However, through this study, VOCs have priority, and in the case of the petroleum refining industry, it is suggested that VOCs should be preemptively measured and analyzed to be regulated. In addition, it is necessary to minimize the impact on the local community by regulating the concentration at the fenceline beyond the chimney measurement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Safety Convergence Science, Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Min-Gyu", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Complex, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeong Hun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Science, Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Seok J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Complex, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Sung Hwan", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Complex, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jeong Ung", "Initials": "JU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Complex, National Institute of Environmental Research, Incheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Cheon Woong", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Environmental Science, Korea University, Seong-buk-gu, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BK21 FOUR R&E Center for Learning Health System, Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "Kyong Whan", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5707-1382"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Science, Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyo Eun", "Initials": "HE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AUG1H506LY", "NameOfSubstance": "propylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36809316", "10.1080/10962247.2023.2182385"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
