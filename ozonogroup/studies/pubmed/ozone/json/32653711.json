Detailed inventories of the two WWTPs were conducted by involving materials and transportation for civil works undertaken. EPD 2018 and ReCiPe life cycle impact assessment methods were employed to measure all the impact categories. Five treatment processes - (1) pumping, (2) primary treatment, (3) secondary treatment, (4) sludge line, and (5) building landscape - were considered for the assessment. It was found that concrete and reinforcing steel played similarly vital roles in most of the EPD 2018 impacts. The significant score of reinforcing steel was found on human cancer toxicity, which contributed more than 90% of the impacts. The contribution of diesel on ozone formation was 5% higher than that of reinforcing steel. Glassfiber was responsible for 70% of the burdens on ozone depletion, showing much higher than the total share of concrete and reinforcing steel. Primary treatment units only contributed 9.5% of the construction impacts in the Girona WWTP but up to 43.8% in Mill Creek WWTP mainly because of the proportion of consumed materials. In short, the comprehensive data inventories were necessary when evaluating the total environmental impacts of the WWTP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
