The result indicated that the NDEA yields (0.4\u00a0%) during chlorination was 1.3 times of that during chloramination (0.3\u00a0%); pre-oxidation with 4\u00a0mg/L O<sub>3</sub> significantly cut down its formation; the reduction rates were up to 67.5 and 48.5\u00a0%, respectively. OH scavenger greatly augmented the final NDEA amount from 1.86 to 5.05\u00a0\u03bcg/L during ozonation, while its roles on subsequent processes differed with disinfection methods as well as O<sub>3</sub>(g) dosages. Most of co-existed substances inhibited NDEA generation, except NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, which slightly promoted during ozonation. Basing on Gaussian calculation, GC/MS and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis, the influencing mechanisms of pre-O<sub>3</sub> on NDEA formation in subsequent disinfection processes were proposed. In addition, the calculated toxicity analysis as well as the whole toxicity was applied to evaluate the possibility of pre-O<sub>3</sub> on risk control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
