This is particularly important for plants growing with high levels of Ca2+ in the rhizosphere. Recently, we have shown that in two calcicoles, Leontodon hispidus L. and Centaurea scabiosa L., trichomes play a key role in this regulatory process. Ozone is known to have a marked effect on plant Ca2+ homeostasis. Therefore, we have examined the effect of this pollutant on the regulation by trichomes of apoplastic Ca2+ in the calcicole L. hispidus. Treatment with 100 nl l-1 ozone resulted in a reduction in stomatal conductance of approximately 25% in plants grown with 15 mM Ca2+ in the rhizosphere. Analysis of total Ca2+ levels revealed that these changes in stomatal behaviour reflect a decrease in the ability of trichomes to sequester Ca2+. The amount of Ca2+ present in the trichome tip cell was reduced by approximately 38%. This was accompanied by an increase in the levels of Ca2+ in the guard cells and other tissues of the leaf. These data suggest that ozone has a detrimental effect on the ability of trichomes to regulate the concentration of apoplastic Ca2+ in L. hispidus, resulting in altered stomatal behaviour, and hence gaseous exchange, possibly due to the disruption of guard-cell Ca(2+)-mediated signal transduction. This has important implications for the growth and survival of plants growing in Ca(2+)-rich soils."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Silva", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansfield", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McAinsh", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M4I0D6VV5M", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Surface Extensions"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11762166", "10.1007/s004250100674"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
