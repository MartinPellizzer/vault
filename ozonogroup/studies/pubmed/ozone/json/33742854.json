In addition, the transport pathways and potential source regions of O<sub>3</sub> were investigated. The results show that surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at the city station in Zhengzhou City increased significantly during the period 2014-2018 (<i>P</i><0.05) with a growth rate of 15.50 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, and the timespan of exceeding pollutant standards was extended. The monthly O<sub>3</sub> variations showed an \"M\" pattern with the seasonal maximum in summer. The diurnal O<sub>3</sub> variations showed a \"single-peak\" pattern with a diurnal concentrations peak at 15:00-16:00, while the diurnal peak at the rural station was relatively high (130.94 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). At the urban station, the exceedance probability of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations was relative high when hourly temperature (<i>T</i>) exceeded 23\u2103, relative humidity (RH) was less than 65%, wind speed (WS) ranged 2.0-4.0 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, and wind direction was southeast or northeast. Based on the multivariate linear fitting of impact factors on O<sub>3</sub>, the main controlling factors at the city and industrial sites were also identified as <i>T</i> and RH compared to <i>T</i> and WS at the traffic and suburb sites. Back trajectory analysis and potential sources of O<sub>3</sub> during different seasons were significantly different, with the dominant transport trajectories during spring and summer being short-distance and slow-moving airflows from the south and northeast; autumn and winter were characterized by long-distance and quick-moving airflows from the northwest. The high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations observed in summer were mainly affected by local photochemical formation and regional transport from Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui Provinces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xu-Dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhengzhou Ecological Environment Monitoring Center of Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450007, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Ming-Hao", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ya-Song", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33742854", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202006197"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
