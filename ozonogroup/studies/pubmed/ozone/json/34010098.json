PS microspheres, prepared using oil-in water (o/w) solvent evaporation method, were loaded with oxygen containing functional groups using an ultraviolet/ozone (UVO<sub>3</sub>) system. Using water-soluble carbodiimide chemistry, gelatin was subsequently immobilized on UVO<sub>3</sub> treated PS microspheres. The amount of immobilized gelatin was found to be directly proportional to the surface carboxyl (COOH) concentration on PS microspheres. Face Centered Central Composite Design (FCCD) was employed to optimize the process conditions of UVO<sub>3</sub> treatment to maximize the surface COOH concentration on PS microspheres for allowing higher gelatin immobilization. Statistical results revealed that, the optimized process conditions were ozone flow rate of \u223c64,603\u2009ppm, exposure time of \u223c60\u2009minutes and sample amount of 5.05\u2009g. Under these conditions, the surface COOH concentration on PS microspheres was \u223c1,505\u2009nmol/g with the corresponding amount of immobilized gelatin was \u223c2,725\u2009\u00b5g/g. Characterization analyses strongly suggest that the optimized UVO<sub>3</sub> treatment and successive gelatin immobilization have successfully improved surface wettability and dispersion stability of PS microspheres. Moreover, gelatin coated PS microcarriers were also proven as able to support the growth of CHO-K1 cells in high cell density culture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7052-5078"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemical and Process Engineering Technology, Lebuhraya Tun Razak, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Arifin", "ForeName": "Mohd Azmir", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia Kulliyyah of Engineering, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mel", "ForeName": "Maizirwan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemical and Process Engineering Technology, Lebuhraya Tun Razak, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Swan", "ForeName": "Sia Yiik", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute for Halal Research and Training, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Samsudin", "ForeName": "Nurhusna", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute for Halal Research and Training, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Hashim", "ForeName": "Yumi Zuhanis Has-Yun", "Initials": "YZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute for Halal Research and Training, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Salleh", "ForeName": "Hamzah Mohd", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Prep Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9607037", "ISSNLinking": "1082-6068"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polystyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-70-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Gelatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CHO Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gelatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microspheres"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polystyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34010098", "10.1080/10826068.2021.1923031"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
