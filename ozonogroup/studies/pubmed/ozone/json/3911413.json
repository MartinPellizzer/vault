The scope of the study was to compare both systems in relation to the removal of organic contaminants in water, and to the reduction of the side effects of chlorination. The water quality was measured with organic surrogate parameters (organohalogen, -nitrogen, -phosphorus and -sulphur) and in bacterial mutagenicity assays. In this particular setting, the combination of ozonation and GAC filtration was superior in all points to GAC filtration alone. The effects of ozonation are sometimes quite different, depending on the type of water treated. Its positive influence should be confirmed in a local situation. As GAC treatment causes a shift towards formation of more brominated THM after chlorination, special attention was given to this item. A higher inorganic bromide/DOC ratio resulted in higher brominated THM concentrations after chlorination. However, the mutagens formed during chlorination in presence of more inorganic bromide could be inactivated more easily by rat liver homogenate than in the normal setting. The results of this study confirmed earlier findings stating a negative influence of chlorination on water quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van der Gaag", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kruithof", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Puijker", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organometallic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organophosphorus Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polystyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37380-43-1", "NameOfSubstance": "amberlite XAD 7"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acrylic Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organometallic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organophosphorus Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polystyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollution, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}], "NumberOfReferences": "19"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3911413", "10.1016/0048-9697(85)90325-0", "0048-9697(85)90325-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
