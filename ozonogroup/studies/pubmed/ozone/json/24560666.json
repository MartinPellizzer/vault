Different surfaces used in food industry including PVC pipes, polyethylene bags, plastic surfaces and fresh produce were analyzed for the biofilm formation by S. typhimurium ST1 and ST2. Malic acid alone was not able to inhibit biofilm formation in all the samples. However, combination of malic acid with ozone reduced the biofilm formation on plastic bags as well as on PVC pipes suggesting as an effective disinfectant for food contact surfaces. Five- and six-fold reduction in biofilm formation was observed in microtitre plates after 20 h and 40 h. Scanning electron micrographs of carrot and turnip showed control over the biofilms. Malic acid as sanitizer in food industry was effective for the complete inhibition of biofilm in carrot and other food contact surfaces, besides this, combined sanitizer (malic acid and ozone) was effective in turnip. Biofilms in food-processing industries can survive even after the sanitizer treatment and may represent reservoirs of product contamination leading to subsequent spoilage and/or food safety risks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.
