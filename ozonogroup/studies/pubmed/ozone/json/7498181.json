Karst needles was studied by fumigating potted grafts from mature trees. Clonal trees of Norway spruce were fumigated in open-top chambers for one growing season. Proteins, soluble and membrane bound, were extracted from the needles in a four-step procedure: (i) grinding in liquid nitrogen and then in a pH 5.0 buffer with thiourea added to inhibit phenol oxidase and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVP) added to bind phenolic compounds; (ii) precipitation of proteins with acetone at -20 degrees C; (iii) solubilization in a modified lysis buffer; and (iv) dialysis against the modified lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis according to O'Farrell's method. The changes in the silver-stained protein pattern were evaluated by using image processing methods. Electrophoretograms from stressed and nonstressed trees are presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Ecology, Norwegian Forest Research Institute, As."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davidsen", "ForeName": "N B", "Initials": "NB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Electrophoresis", "NlmUniqueID": "8204476", "ISSNLinking": "0173-0835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver Staining"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7498181", "10.1002/elps.11501601214"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
