The most stable and precise transducer heads are heated and, therefore, prone to accelerated ozone decomposition, limiting measurement accuracy and compromising purity. Here, we describe a vacuum system and a method for ozone production, suitable to accurately determine the pressure of pure ozone by avoiding the problem of decomposition. We use an inert gas in a particularly designed buffer volume and can thus achieve high measurement accuracy and negligible degradation of ozone with purities of 99.8% or better. The high degree of purity is ensured by comprehensive compositional analyses of ozone samples. The method may also be applied to other reactive gases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNRS, UMR 7092, Laboratoire de Physique Mol\u00e9culaire pour l'Atmosph\u00e8re et l'Astrophysique, F-75005, Paris, France. janssen@lpma.jussieu.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janssen", "ForeName": "Christof", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simone", "ForeName": "Daniela", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guinet", "ForeName": "Micka\u00ebl", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Sci Instrum", "NlmUniqueID": "0405571", "ISSNLinking": "0034-6748"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21456766", "10.1063/1.3557512"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
