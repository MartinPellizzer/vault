The patients were randomized to either ozone injection (n=23) or lidocaine injection (n=23) groups. All injections were administered once a week for three consecutive weeks. The primary outcome measure was the pain severity assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures were cervical lateral flexion range of motion (ROM), pain score (PS), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). The measurements were performed before the treatment, and at four and 12 weeks after treatment.", "There was a significant effect of time for VAS, PS, and NDI scores in both groups. Compared to baseline versus Weeks 4 and 12, the VAS, PS, and NDI scores significantly decreased over time in both groups (p<0.001 for all). A significant group X time interaction was identified regarding the VAS scores. The mean difference in the VAS scores over time was significantly higher in the lidocaine group compared to the oxygen-ozone group (p=0.028).", "Oxygen-ozone and lidocaine injections of the trigger point can effectively improve pain and functional status. However, lidocaine injection appears to be superior in reducing pain compared to oxygen-ozone injection, but is not superior in improving function and PS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9538-1453"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Health Sciences University, Gaziler Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Korkmaz", "ForeName": "Nurdan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6439-8818"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Health Sciences University, Gaziler Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "\u00d6r\u00fcc\u00fc Atar", "ForeName": "Merve", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8800-8776"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Health Sciences University, Gaziler Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Uyar K\u00f6yl\u00fc", "ForeName": "Sinem", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8276-9627"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Health Sciences University, Gaziler Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Aslan", "ForeName": "Sefa G\u00fcmr\u00fck", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2934-0423"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Ankara City Hospital, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Tezen", "ForeName": "\u00d6zge", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9400-4683"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Health Sciences University, G\u00fclhane School of Medicine, Gaziler Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Kesikburun", "ForeName": "Serdar", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Turk J Phys Med Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "101719024", "ISSNLinking": "2587-1250"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The authors declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Lucas N, Macaskill P, Irwig L, Moran R, Bogduk N.
