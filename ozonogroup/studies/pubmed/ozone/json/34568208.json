Elastomeric modules from brackets were collected at T<sub>0</sub> (Fresh samples) and T<sub>1</sub> (2<sup>nd</sup> week) and T<sub>2</sub> (4<sup>th</sup> week) for assessment of the microbial growth. These collected modules were cultured and evaluated for the presence of Streptococcus Mutans and Lactobacilli and numbers of colonies were counted at each interval. Data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software (Version 20.0). Level of significance was kept at 5%. Intra-group and inter-group comparison between pretreatment, 2<sup>nd</sup> week and 4<sup>th</sup> week was done for each group using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney U test.", "There was presence of Streptococcus Mutans and Lactobacilli during orthodontic treatment which progressively increased from T<sub>o</sub> to T<sub>1</sub> and then declined from T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>2.</sub> The colony counts were maximum for Fluoridated mouthwash and least for Chlorhexidine and the results were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05).", "All three antimicrobial agents used were effective against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. Chlorhexidine proved to be more efficacious whereas Fluoridated mouthwash proved to be least effective against both Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus bacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2021 Journal of Orthodontic Science."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, I.
