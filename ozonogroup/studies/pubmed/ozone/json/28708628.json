The removal of 18 multi-class pharmaceuticals, as model trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), has been studied. (Biological) activated carbon filtration could reduce the amount of TrOCs significantly (>99%) but is cost-intensive for full-scale applications. Filtration techniques mainly depending on biodegradation mechanisms (TF and SSF) are found to be inefficient for TrOCs removal as a stand alone technique. Ozonation resulted in 90% removal of the total amount of quantified TrOCs, but a post-ozonation step is needed to cope with an increased unselective toxicity. SSF following ozonation showed to be the only technique able to reduce the unselective toxicity to the same level as before ozonation. In view of process control, innovative correlation models developed for the monitoring and control of TrOC removal during ozonation, are verified for their applicability during ozonation in combination with TF, SSF or BAC. Particularly for the poorly ozone reactive TrOCs, statistically significant models were obtained that correlate TrOC removal and reduction in UVA<sub>254</sub> as an online measured surrogate parameter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk, Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, Kortrijk B-8500, Belgium E-mail: michael.chys@ugent.be; michael.chys@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Chys", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EnVOC, Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent B-9000, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Demeestere", "ForeName": "Kristof", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk, Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, Kortrijk B-8500, Belgium E-mail: michael.chys@ugent.be; michael.chys@gmail.com; EnVOC, Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent B-9000, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Ingabire", "ForeName": "Ange Sabine", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BioGEM, Faculty of Applied Engineering, University of Antwerp, Salesianenlaan 90, Hoboken B-2660, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Dries", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "EnVOC, Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, Ghent B-9000, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Van Langenhove", "ForeName": "Herman", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LIWET, Department of Industrial Biological Sciences, Ghent University Campus Kortrijk, Graaf Karel de Goedelaan 5, Kortrijk B-8500, Belgium E-mail: michael.chys@ugent.be; michael.chys@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Van Hulle", "ForeName": "Stijn W H", "Initials": "SWH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28708628", "10.2166/wst.2017.207"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
