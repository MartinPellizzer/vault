The effect of air pollution on venous thromboembolism (VTE) is less certain. <b>Objectives:</b> To test for associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and VTE. <b>Methods:</b> This is a retrospective case-crossover study of adult patients with an objectively confirmed VTE event. Exposure to the mean and maximum particulate matter \u2a7d2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone were estimated with inverse distance squared weighting from multiple stationary air quality monitors. Conditional logistic regression with a 7-day individual lag model estimated the odds ratio (OR) of VTE occurrence during the case period relative to the referent period. Prespecified subgroup analysis was performed to further test associations in higher risk patients. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,803 VTE events met inclusion criteria for analysis. Deep vein thrombosis was identified in 1,966 (70.1%) and pulmonary embolism in 915 (32.6%) subjects. Median age was 57 years. Small negative associations were observed for the maximum PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure at 1 day (OR, 0.992; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.986-0.997) and the mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure at 1 day (OR, 0.982; 95% CI, 0.97-0.994), 5 days (OR, 0.987; 95% CI, 0.975-0.999), 6 days (OR, 0.984; 95% CI, 0.972-0.996), and 7 days (OR, 0.982; 95% CI, 0.971-0.994) before VTE diagnosis. Similar negative associations were observed for the 8-hour mean (OR, 0.989; 95% CI, 0.981-0.997) and 8-hour maximum (OR, 0.992; 95% CI, 0.985-0.999) ozone exposure 4 days before VTE diagnosis. Positive relationships (ORs of \u223c1.02) between the 8-hour mean and maximum ozone exposures 6-7 days preceding VTE diagnosis were observed in a recently hospitalized subgroup. <b>Conclusions:</b> Short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone does not appear to be associated with an overall increased risk of VTE. Further well-designed studies are needed to test whether previously reported associations between VTE and air pollution exist."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3059-8026"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of General Internal Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Utah Health Thrombosis Service, University of Utah Medical Center."}], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Stacy A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of City & Metropolitan Planning, and."}], "LastName": "Mendoza", "ForeName": "Daniel L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, and."}], "LastName": "Pirozzi", "ForeName": "Cheryl S", "Initials": "CS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "UL1 TR002538", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Am Thorac Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "101600811", "ISSNLinking": "2325-6621"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Venous Thromboembolism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33984246", "10.1513/AnnalsATS.202010-1337OC"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
