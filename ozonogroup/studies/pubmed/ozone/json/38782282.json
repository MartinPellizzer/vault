To reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, the newly-discovered nod gene which can directly convert NO into N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> was successfully cloned from the anaerobic denitrification sludge. The recombinant plasmid containing the nod gene was built, and the expression of nod gene in Escherichia coli was determined, leading to the construction of recombinant engineering bacteria. Results showed that the recombinant engineering bacteria E. coli BL21 (DE3)-pET28a-nod could autonomously degrade NO, with a degradation rate of 72\u00a0% within 48\u00a0h, and could produce 2479.72\u00a0ppm of N<sub>2</sub> and 75.12\u00a0mL of O<sub>2</sub>. The cumulative O<sub>2</sub> production of the sludge sample and recombinant E. coli within 8\u00a0h was 1.75\u00a0mL and 8.45\u00a0mL, respectively. The cumulative O<sub>2</sub> production of recombinant E. coli was at least 4.82 times higher than that of the sludge sample. The investigation proposed a new biodegradation pathway for nitrogen pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
