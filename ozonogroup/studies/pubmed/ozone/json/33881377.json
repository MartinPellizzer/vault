Initially, the ozonation pretreatment (OZP) method was performed by varying ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) dosage and disintegration time. At optimized conditions (O<sub>3</sub> dosage (0.04\u2009g/g suspended solid; SS) and disintegration time (40\u2009minutes)), 17.6% of liquefied organics emancipate rate (LER) and 13.5% of SS reduction were perceived. Further augmenting LER of fruit waste, OZCAP method was proceeded by varying citric acid dosage and disintegration time at an optimized OZP dosage (0.04\u2009g/g SS). A higher LER (24.4%) and SS reduction (19%) were described at an optimal citric acid dosage (0.03\u2009g/g SS) and disintegration time (20\u2009minutes). Then, the hydrogen production potential of OZCAP, OZP and raw fruit waste were evaluated in which OZCAP method exhibited a higher cumulative hydrogen production (30\u2009mL/g volatile solids). Energy valuation reveals that OZCAP method exhibited a net energy of 3.7\u2009kWh/kg of fruit waste."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sethupathy", "ForeName": "Anbazhagan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Pathak", "ForeName": "Pushkar Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1762-3779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Sivashanmugam", "ForeName": "Palani", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, KL University, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Arun", "ForeName": "Chelliah", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Thiruvarur, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Banu", "ForeName": "Jayakumar Rajesh", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."}], "LastName": "Ashokkumar", "ForeName": "Muthupandian", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9881064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2968PHW8QP", "NameOfSubstance": "Citric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7YNJ3PO35Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Citric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33881377", "10.1177/0734242X211010364"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
