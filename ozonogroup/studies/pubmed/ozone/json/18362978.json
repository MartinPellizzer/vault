In this tutorial review, the kinetics, products and mechanisms of these reactions are examined, starting with a discussion of the original mechanism proposed by Criegee and following with a summary presentation of the complex, free radical-mediated reactions of carbonyl oxide (Criegee) intermediates. The contribution of ozone-terpene reactions to the atmospheric burden of secondary organic aerosol material is also discussed from the viewpoint of the formation of non-volatile organic acid products from the complex chemistry of ozone with alpha-pinene. Throughout the article, currently accepted understanding is supported through the presentation of key experimental results, and areas of persistent or new uncertainty are highlighted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading, PO Box 224, Whiteknights, Reading, UK RG6 6AD."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marston", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Soc Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "0335405", "ISSNLinking": "0306-0012"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18362978", "10.1039/b704260b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
