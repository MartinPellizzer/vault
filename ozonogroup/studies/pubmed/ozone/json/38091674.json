Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of ozone pollution on renal function and explore mechanisms. We first conducted a cross-sectional study based on Wuhan Chronic Disease Cohort Study baseline information. We recruited 2699 eligible participants, estimated their residential ozone concentrations, collected fasting peripheral blood samples for biochemical analysis and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The linear regression model was applied to evaluate the long-term association between ozone pollution and eGFR. Then, we recruited another 70 volunteers as a panel with 8 rounds follow-up visits. We calculated the eGFR and measured fasting blood glucose and lipid levels. The linear mixed-effect model along with mediation analysis were performed to confirm the short-term association and explore potential mechanisms, respectively. For the long-term association, a 10.95\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment of 3-year ozone exposure was associated with 2.96\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> decrease in eGFR (95%CI: -4.85, -1.06). Furthermore, the drinkers exhibited a pronounced declination of eGFR (-7.46\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>, 95%CI: -11.84, -3.08) compared to non-drinkers in relation to ozone exposure. Additionally, a 19.02\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in 3-day ozone concentrations was related to 2.51\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> decrease in eGFR (95%CI: -3.78, -1.26). Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance mediated 12.2% and 16.5% of the aforementioned association, respectively. Our findings indicated that higher ozone pollution could affect renal function, and the hyperglycemia and insulin resistance linked to ozone might be the underlying mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
