We performed an untargeted serum proteomic analysis in a randomized, crossover, controlled exposure trial. We recruited 32 healthy young adults and asked them to receive filtered air and 200-ppb ozone exposures for 2\u00a0h in a random order before serum collection. Linear mixed-effect models were used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the two exposures and Gene Ontology enrichment and ingenuity pathway analysis were performed to determine their biological function. A total of 56 DEPs were identified. For example, acute ozone exposure increased coagulation factor X and factor VII-activating protease by 20.96% and 28.35%, respectively. Whereas, protein Z, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor, and plasminogen decreased by 13.62%, 33.54%, and 10.47%, respectively. We also observed a 42.32% decrease in paraoxonase 3 and evident changes in four apolipoproteins. Additionally, we found 18.21% and 95.82% increases in L-selectin and \u03b22-microglobulin, respectively, and significant changes in three complements. DEPs and enriched pathways suggest that short-term ozone exposure may promote coagulation, suppress fibrinolysis, disrupt lipoprotein metabolism, activate immune responses, and affect the complement system. These findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms linking acute ozone exposure to thrombosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
