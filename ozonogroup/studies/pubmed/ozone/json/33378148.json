To maintain the performance, the device should be packaged in such a way that it hermetically blocks moisture from the device; however, in practice, it is rather difficult to achieve. The more practical solution is to impede the moisture ingress to the device. In optoelectronic devices that will be outdoors like solar cells, the interfacial adhesion strength between the encapsulant layer (adhesive) and a moisture barrier layer is also a critical parameter. This paper presents surface modifications of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) carrier films, one of the layers in the trilayer barrier film that directly adheres to an encapsulant, using chemical, UV/ozone, and both treatments to improve adhesion with the thermoset encapsulant polymer material. Whereas previous studies also utilized treatment methods to increase the wettability characteristics, in this paper, we not only present the results of the adhesion strength upon various techniques to achieve good adhesion but also screen their behavior upon exposure to a damp-heat (60 \u00b0C, 90% RH) environment. We found that the combined treatment method increases the adhesion by up to 12.1-fold and demonstrates up to a 200% increase in adhesion strength even upon our severe damp-heat environmental condition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Hah", "ForeName": "Jinho", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "George W.
