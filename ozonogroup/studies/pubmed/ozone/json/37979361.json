These substances can be produced by marine microalgae, estimates of their current and future emissions are imperfect, because the processes by which marine microalgae respond to environmental changes are rarely account for environmental pollutants. Here, concurrent measurements of the potential effects of polystyrene (PS) microplastics with concentrations of 25-100\u00a0mg/L on the growth of Phaeodactylum tricornutum and their volatile halocarbons (VHCs) production were made over a 20-day culture period. The maximum inhibition rates (IR) due to 0.1\u00a0\u00b5m and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m PS microplastics on cell density were 40.11 % and 32.87 %, on Chl a content were 25.89 % and 20.73 %, and on Fv/Fm were 9.74 % and 9.00 %, respectively. All IR showed dose-dependent effects with maxima occurring in the logarithmic phase. However, in the stationary phase, P. tricornutum exposed to PS microplastics exhibited improved attributes. Enhanced biogenesis of VHCs was induced by the excess reactive oxygen species in algal cells due to microplastics exposure, and their production rates were higher in the logarithmic phase than stationary phase. This represents that oxidative stress to cells plays a dominant role in determining the release of CHBrCl<sub>2</sub>, CHBr<sub>2</sub>Cl, and CHBr<sub>3</sub>. Hence, we suggest that the widespread microplastics in the ocean may be partly responsible for the increase in the emission of VHCs by marine phytoplankton, thereby affecting the ozone layer recovery in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
