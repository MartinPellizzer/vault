The NILU-UV irradiance meter is a ground-based, multi-channel, moderate bandwidth filter instrument. UVI values derived from measurements by a NILU-UV instrument deployed in the New York area (40.74\u00b0N, -74.03\u00b0E) to monitor the erythemal UV radiation from 2010 to present is compared to UVI values derived from OMI measurements and predicted by the NWS model. OMI overestimated the UVI values by 13.06% for all cloud conditions compared with the UVI values derived from measurements by the NILU-UV instrument. The heavier the cloud cover, the higher the overestimation. The mean relative difference between the UVI derived from the NWS model and from NILU-UV measurements was 11.54%. The UVI prediction by NWS was also overestimated under cloudy conditions. Under overcast conditions the NWS predictions of UVI values differ significantly from those derived from NILU-UV measurements, yielding a correlation of only 0.8025 and a mean relative difference of 28.25%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dahlback", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stamnes", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stamnes", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stamnes", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25968369", "10.1364/AO.54.001945", "312600"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
