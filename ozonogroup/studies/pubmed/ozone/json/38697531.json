While stringent control measures targeting VOCs have been implemented in recent years, an assessment of historical trends is imperative to evaluate their effectiveness. In this study, trends of VOC emissions, compositions, and reactivity from solvent use sources in the PRD region from 2006 to 2019 were estimated using a developed methodology, which considered the improvement of manufacturing equipment and removal efficiency. Results showed that total VOC emissions from solvent use sources displayed an overall increase from 277 kt in 2006 to 400 kt in 2019 despites some fluctuations, with metal products contributing more than 20\u00a0% each year. Aromatics and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) accounted for over 70\u00a0% of total VOC emissions, increasing by 21 kt and 52 kt respectively. OFP and SOAFP increased by 40\u00a0% and 23\u00a0% respectively from 2006 to 2019. Specific aromatic species, including m/p-xylene, toluene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, o-xylene and ethylbenzene were identified as key species in both VOC emission amount and reactivity. This study aims to facilitate the understanding of VOC emission evolution from solvent use sources in the region and provide insights into the impact of enacted measures, aiding in the future development of more targeted and efficient strategies in the PRD region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
