To determine whether NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> sensors meet this criterion, three commercially available units (Cairclip O<sub>3</sub>/NO<sub>2</sub>, Aeroqual NO<sub>2</sub>, and Aeroqual O<sub>3</sub> sensors) were co-located three times with validated instruments (NO<sub>x</sub> chemiluminescence [NO<sub>2mon</sub>] and photometric O<sub>3</sub> analyzers [O<sub>3mon</sub>]) at an outdoor monitoring station. As cofactors of sensor performance such as temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) potentially influence the response of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> sensors, corrections for cofactors were made by using T, RH, and the sensor measurements to predict measurements made by NO<sub>2mon</sub> and O<sub>3mon</sub> during the first co-location period (training dataset). The developed models were tested in the merged data obtained from the second and third co-location periods (testing dataset). In the training and testing datasets, the mean NO<sub>2</sub> as measured by NO<sub>2mon</sub> was 4.6\u2009ppb (range = 0.4-35\u2009ppb) and 9.4\u2009ppb (range = 1-37\u2009ppb), respectively. The mean O<sub>3</sub> in the training and testing datasets as measured by O<sub>3mon</sub> was 38.8\u2009ppb (range = 1-65\u2009ppb) and 35.7\u2009ppb (range = 1-61\u2009ppb), respectively. None of the sensor measurements in the training dataset were within the NIOSH accuracy criterion (mean error \u226525%). After correcting for cofactors of sensor performance, the accuracy of the Cairclip O<sub>3</sub>/NO<sub>2</sub> and the Aeroqual O<sub>3</sub> sensors considerably improved when tested with the testing dataset (mean error\u2009=\u2009-1% and 14%, respectively). However, the Aeroqual NO<sub>2</sub> sensor had an error that was not within \u00b125%. Raw measurements from the tested sensors may be unsuitable for assessing workers' exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Corrections for cofactors of Cairclip O<sub>3</sub>/NO<sub>2</sub> and Aeroqual O<sub>3</sub> sensor performance are required for more accurate occupational exposure assessment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isiugo", "ForeName": "Kelechi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newman", "ForeName": "Nicholas", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jandarov", "ForeName": "Roman", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grinshpun", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Environmental Health , University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reponen", "ForeName": "Tiina", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES006096", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T42 OH008432", "Acronym": "OH", "Agency": "NIOSH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Occup Environ Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "101189458", "ISSNLinking": "1545-9624"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Roth HD, Hwang PMT, and Li Y: Assessment of recent ozone short-term epidemiologic studies.
