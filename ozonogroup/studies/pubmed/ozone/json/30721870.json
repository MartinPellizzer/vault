Many epidemiological studies have reported the association between O<sub>3</sub> pollution and mortality, only a few studies have focused on the O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality and corresponding economic effects at the Chinese city and province level. This study reports the seasonal variation of ground-level O<sub>3</sub> in 338 cities of China during the year 2016 and evaluates its effect on premature mortality and economic loss. It further illustrates the differences in cause-specific mortality outcomes of the log-linear and linear model, two of the prominently used methods for estimating health effects. In 2016, the annual average daily maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> concentration in China ranged between 74 and 201\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (138\u202f\u00b1\u202f24.7\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). 30% of the total population was exposed to >160\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> O<sub>3</sub> concentration (Chinese national ambient air quality standard) and about 67.2% urban population lived in exposure above the WHO recommended O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (100\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). The estimated national O<sub>3</sub>-attributable mortality was 74.2 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: 16.7\u00d710<sup>3</sup>-127\u00d710<sup>3</sup>) in the log-linear model, whereas, the total O<sub>3</sub>-related mortality using the linear model was 69.6 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: 16.2 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup>-115 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup>). The exposure to O<sub>3</sub> caused a nationwide economic loss of about 7.6 billion US$ (range: 1.7-12.9) in 2016. This study uniquely provides most comprehensive coverage of the Chinese cities for O<sub>3</sub> associated mortality utilizing ground level measurement data for 2016 and presents a measurable assessment to the policymakers of China for streamlining their efforts on air quality improvement and O<sub>3</sub> containment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
