Here, we report year-long, high temporal resolution monitoring results of airborne alpha radioactivity from both radon gas and radon progeny attached to particulates immediately northeast of an oil refinery in Commerce City, Colorado, USA, in an environmental justice community of concern. Gas and particle-associated radioactivity contributed nearly evenly to the total alpha radioactivity. Total radioactivity levels of 30-40\u2009Bq m<sup>-3</sup> were 2-3 times higher than background levels (~10-15\u2009Bq m<sup>-3</sup>) when winds were light and southwesterly, suggesting the refinery as the geographic origin. Furthermore, elevated airborne radioactivity tracked most closely with the light hydrocarbon and natural gas tracer ethane. Thus, the data imply natural gas as the radon emission carrier, possibly from flaring. However, this could not explain all our particle-associated radioactivity observations. Our findings are unique and suggest a need for further investigations of radon emissions from oil and gas infrastructure such as natural gas processing plants, compressor stations, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries that process oil and natural gas from unconventional production.<i>Implications Statement</i>: Regulatory agencies currently do not mandate or conduct monitoring of radioactivity releases and public exposure from petroleum industry air emissions. This study reports elevated radioactivity from radon gas and nonvolatile radon decay products attached to particulate matter, at about 2-3 times above background levels in proximity to Colorado's largest oil refinery. Observations were within an environmental justice community of concern that experiences well above-average exposure to many other harmful atmospheric pollutants, suggesting potential adverse health effects from this cumulative exposure. Our findings offer actionable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and affected communities alike."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1612-1651"], "LastName": "Helmig", "ForeName": "Detlev", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rolling Stone Magazine, New York, New York, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nobel", "ForeName": "Justin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Planet Ozone Meteorological Consulting, Concord, California, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5284-6855"], "LastName": "Caputi", "ForeName": "Dani", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Human Health Inc, Westport, Connecticut, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daly", "ForeName": "Ryan W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LDWX LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Darby", "ForeName": "Lisa S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Be the Change - Colorado, Littleton, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doe", "ForeName": "Phillip T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cultivando, Adams County, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "Olga", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greenberg", "ForeName": "Gabriel", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hueber", "ForeName": "Jacques", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kateric Ltd, Longmont, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Potter", "ForeName": "Kat", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schade", "ForeName": "Gunnar W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pitch Roll and Yaw LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Simoncic", "ForeName": "Susan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boulder Atmosphere Innovation Research LLC, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fort Collins, Colorado, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stahli", "ForeName": "Michel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Subra Company, New Iberia, Louisiana, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subra", "ForeName": "Wilma", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39189887", "10.1080/10962247.2024.2393194"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
