Variety ampla, whose ozone sensitivity is less well known, is native to Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO). In the early 2000s, researchers found putative ozone symptoms on var. ampla and rhizomes were sent to Appalachian State University to verify that the symptoms were the result of ozone exposure. In 2011, potted plants were exposed to ambient ozone from May to August. These same plants were grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) in 2012 and 2013, and exposed to charcoal-filtered (CF), non-filtered (NF), elevated ozone (EO), NF+50ppb in 2012 for 47days and NF+30/NF+50ppb ozone in 2013 for 36 and 36days, respectively. Ozone symptoms similar to those found in ROMO (blue-black adaxial stippling) were reproduced both in ambient air and in the OTCs. Both varieties exhibited foliar injury in the OTCs in an exposure-dependent manner, verifying that symptoms resulted from ozone exposure. In two of the three study years, var. digitata appeared more sensitive than var. ampla. Exposure to EO caused reductions in ambient photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) for both varieties. Light response curves indicated that ozone reduced A, g<sub>s</sub>, and the apparent quantum yield while it increased the light compensation point. In CF air, var. ampla had higher light saturated A (18.2\u00b11.04 vs 11.6\u00b10.37\u03bcmolm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), higher light saturation (1833\u00b1166.7 vs 1108\u00b1141.7\u03bcmolm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), and lower Ci/Ca ratio (0.67\u00b10.01 vs 0.77\u00b10.01) than var. digitata. Coneflowers in both Parks are adversely affected by exposure to ambient ozone and if ozone concentrations increase in the Rocky Mountains, greater amounts of injury on var. ampla can be expected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
