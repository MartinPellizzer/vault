Although 6-PPDQ toxicity has been frequently assessed in aquatic organisms, the possible toxic effects of 6-PPDQ on mammals remain largely unclear. We here aimed to perform systematic assessment to evaluate 6-PPDQ toxicity on multiple organs in mice. Male BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 6-PPDQ for two exposure modes, single intraperitoneal injection and repeated intraperitoneal injection every four days for 28\u00a0days. Serum, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, testis, brain, and heart were collected for injury evaluation by organ index, histopathology analysis and biochemical parameters. In 0.4 and 4\u00a0mg/kg 6-PPDQ single injected mice, no significant changes in organ indexes and biochemical parameters were detected, and only moderate pathological changes were observed in organs of liver, kidney, lung, and brain. Very different from this, in 0.4 and 4\u00a0mg/kg 6-PPDQ repeated injected mice, we observed the obvious increase in organ indexes of liver, kidney, lung, testis, and brain, and the decrease in spleen index. Meanwhile, the significant pathological changes were formed in liver, kidney, lung, spleen, testis, and brain in 0.4 and 4\u00a0mg/kg 6-PPDQ repeated injected mice. Biochemical parameters of liver (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) and kidney (urea and creatinine) were all significantly upregulated by repeated injection with 0.4 and 4\u00a0mg/kg 6-PPDQ. After repeated exposure, most of 6-PPDQ was accumulated in liver and lung of mice. Therefore, our results suggested the risk of repeated exposure to 6-PPDQ in inducing toxicity on multiple organs in mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
