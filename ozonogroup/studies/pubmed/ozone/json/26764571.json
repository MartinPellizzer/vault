The oxidative transformations of the phenylurea herbicides fenuron, monuron and diuron were investigated. The initial rates of transformation demonstrated that UV photolysis was highly efficient in the cases of diuron and monuron. Ozonation proved to be much more effective in the transformation of fenuron than in those of the chlorine containing monuron and diuron. In heterogeneous photocatalysis, the rate of decomposition decreased with increase of the number of chlorine atoms in the target molecule. Addition of ozone to UV-irradiated solutions and/or TiO2-containing suspensions markedly increased the initial rates of degradation. Dehalogenation of monuron and diuron showed that each of these procedures is suitable for the simultaneous removal of chlorinated pesticides and their chlorinated intermediates. Heterogeneous photocatalysis was found to be effective in the mineralization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Isotopes, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences , Budapest , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Kov\u00e1cs", "ForeName": "Krisztina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Farkas", "ForeName": "J\u00e1nos", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Ver\u00e9b", "ForeName": "G\u00e1bor", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Arany", "ForeName": "Eszter", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Simon", "ForeName": "Gerg\u0151", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry , University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Schrantz", "ForeName": "Krisztina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Dombi", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e1s", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Applied and Environmental Chemistry , University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1di", "ForeName": "Kl\u00e1ra", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Research Group of Environmental Chemistry, University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry , University of Szeged , Szeged , Hungary."}], "LastName": "Alapi", "ForeName": "T\u00fcnde", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9I3SDS92WY", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I99GAK5X1D", "NameOfSubstance": "monuron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O7L040435W", "NameOfSubstance": "fenuron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diuron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26764571", "10.1080/03601234.2015.1120597"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
