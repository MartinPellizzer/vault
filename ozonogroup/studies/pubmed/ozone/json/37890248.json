This review assesses the efficacy of photolysis, O<sub>3</sub> based (O<sub>3</sub>/UV, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/UV, Fenton, Fenton-like, hetero-system) and sonochemical and electro-oxidative AOPs in this regard. The main purpose of this review and some suggestions for the advancement of AOPs is to facilitate the elimination of toxic organic pollutants. Initially proposed for the purification of drinking water in 1980, AOPs have since been employed for various wastewater treatments. AOPs technologies are essentially a process intensification through the use of hybrid methods for wastewater treatment, which generate large amounts of hydroxyl (\u2022OH) and sulfate (SO4\u00b7-) radicals, the ultimate oxidants for the remediation of organic pollutants. This review covers the use of AOPs and ozone or UV treatment in combination to create a powerful method of wastewater treatment. This novel approach has been demonstrated to be highly effective, with the acceleration of the oxidation process through Fenton reaction and photocatalytic oxidation technologies. It is clear that Advance Oxidation Process are a helpful for the degradation of organic toxic compounds. Additionally, other processes such as \u2022OH and SO4\u00b7-\u00a0radical-based oxidation may also arise during AOPs treatment and contribute to the reduction of target organic pollutants. This review summarizes the current development of AOPs treatment of wastewater organic pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
