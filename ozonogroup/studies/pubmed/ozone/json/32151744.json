The assessment of their tissue concentrations may improve our understanding of how they attenuate pathophysiological mechanisms promoting disease. We hypothesized that significant differences exist when the tissue concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, and nitrosylated species (RXNO) are compared among different tissues, particularly when nitrite is administered orally because nitrite generates various NO-related species in the stomach. We studied the different time-dependent changes in plasma and tissue concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, and RXNO after oral nitrite 15\u00a0mg/kg was administered rats, which were euthanized 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 or 1440\u00a0min after nitrite administration. A control group received water. Arterial blood samples were collected and the rats were perfused with a PBS solution containing NEM/DTPA to prevent the destruction of RXNO. After perfusion, heart, aorta, mesenteric artery, brain, stomach, liver and femoral muscle were harvested and immediately stored at -70\u00b0C until analyzed for their nitrite, nitrate and RXNO contents using an ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence assay. While nitrite administration did not increase aortic nitrite or nitrate concentrations for at least 60\u00a0min, both aorta and mesenteric vessels stored nitrite from 8 to 24\u00a0h after its administration and their tissue concentrations increased from 10 to 40-fold those found in plasma. In contrast, the other studied tissues showed only transient increases in the concentrations of these NO metabolites, including RXNO. The differences among tissues may reflect differences in mechanisms regulating cellular influx of nitrite. These findings have important pharmacological and clinical implications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
