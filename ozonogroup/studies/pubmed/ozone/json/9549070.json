These compounds are chemically reduced to nitric oxide, which is determined by its chemiluminescent reaction with ozone. Suspended materials and colors in cosmetic products do not interfere. Hence their removal before analysis is not required. A detection limit of 33 ppb, calculated as nitrite, was obtained. No false-positive interferences were observed from antifoaming agents, several N-nitroso compounds, and nitrate up to 20 ppm. Among cosmetic products surveyed, potential nitrosating agents were found at levels ranging from 113 to 5021 ppb. No consistent relationship was found between levels of potential nitrosating agents and N-nitrosamines in the same products. However, the highest levels of nitrosating agents were most often associated with the highest levels of N-nitrosamines known to be present in the products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC 20204, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yates", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cosmetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cosmetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9549070"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
