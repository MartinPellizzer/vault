The rice plants were subjected to three gas treatments (charcoal-filtered air (CF) and O<sub>3</sub> at 1.0 (1.0\u00d7O<sub>3</sub>) and 1.5 (1.5\u00d7O<sub>3</sub>) times the ambient concentration) in combination with two conditions of N fertilization. At five time points throughout the growth period, plant samples were collected to measure the leaf area and dry mass of each plant organ. At the final harvest, yield, yield components, and harvest index were measured. There was a significant interactive effect of O<sub>3</sub> and N on leaf, stem, root, and whole-plant dry mass at the final harvest. The dry mass of each plant organ and the whole-plant dry mass of rice plants grown in 1.5\u00d7O<sub>3</sub> were significantly lower than those in the plants grown in CF and 1.0\u00d7O<sub>3</sub> under SN, whereas there were no significant differences in the dry mass among the three gas treatments under NN. Brown rice yield was significantly reduced by the exposure to O<sub>3</sub> under SN, but not under NN. Relative yield loss rate based on the AOT40 (accumulated exposure over a threshold of 40\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup>) was pronounced under SN, whereas relative yield was almost unchanged at different AOT40 levels under NN. We concluded that the sensitivity of growth and yield of rice to O<sub>3</sub> is dependent on N levels in the soil; the exposure to ambient levels of O<sub>3</sub> has a negative effect on rice under SN, but not under NN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental and Agricultural Engineering, Institute of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan. tatsumi@go.tuat.ac.jp."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama, 332-0012, Japan. tatsumi@go.tuat.ac.jp."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6763-6909"], "LastName": "Tatsumi", "ForeName": "Kenichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecoregion Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abiko", "ForeName": "Tamami", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Yamanashi, 4-4-37 Takeda, Kofu, Yamanashi, 400-8510, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinose", "ForeName": "Yoshiyuki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inagaki", "ForeName": "Shiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Science on Biosphere, Institute of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izuta", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "JPMJPR1603", "Agency": "Japan Science and Technology Agency", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "16K18778", "Agency": "Japan Society for the Promotion of Science", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2009 May;157(5):1445-52", "ArticleIdList": ["18977574"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2018 May 23;66(20):5125-5132", "ArticleIdList": ["29715025"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2008 Oct;155(3):453-63", "ArticleIdList": ["18456378"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell. 2018 Mar;30(3):638-651", "ArticleIdList": ["29475937"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2018 Mar;25(9):8174-8180", "ArticleIdList": ["29116534"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2000 Sep;109(3):517-24", "ArticleIdList": ["15092885"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci (China). 2008;20(3):320-5", "ArticleIdList": ["18595399"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Biol (Stuttg). 2009 Nov;11 Suppl 1:70-5", "ArticleIdList": ["19778370"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1987;47(2):95-113", "ArticleIdList": ["15092712"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Environ. 2006 Jul;29(7):1193-209", "ArticleIdList": ["17080943"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1991;74(2):149-64", "ArticleIdList": ["15092071"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2010 May;158(5):1763-7", "ArticleIdList": ["19962222"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1994;86(3):287-95", "ArticleIdList": ["15091620"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1996;93(2):121-7", "ArticleIdList": ["15091350"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31493087", "10.1007/s11356-019-06358-6", "10.1007/s11356-019-06358-6"]}}]}
