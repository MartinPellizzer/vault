It has been well-known that ozone has potent ability to oxidize organic compounds and can induce respiratory irritation. Although ozone has deleterious effects, many therapeutic effects have also been suggested. Since last few decades, the therapeutic potential of ozone has gained much attention through its strong capacity to induce controlled and moderated oxidative stress when administered in precise therapeutic doses. A plethora of scientific evidence showed that the activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1a), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element (Nrf2-ARE), and activated protein-1 (AP-1) pathways are the main molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ozone therapy. Activation of these molecular pathways leads to up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant systems, activation of immune functions as well as suppression of inflammatory processes, which is important for correcting oxidative stress in diabetes and spinal pain. The present study intended to review critically the available scientific evidence concerning the beneficial properties of ozone therapy for treatment of diabetic complications and spinal pain. It finds benefit for integrating the therapy with ozone into pharmacological procedures, instead of a substitutive or additional option to therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braidy", "ForeName": "Nady", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izadi", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Grup de Nutrici\u00f3 Comunit\u00e0ria i Estr\u00e8s Oxidatiu (IUNICS) and CIBEROBN (Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition), Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sureda", "ForeName": "Antoni", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jonaidi-Jafari", "ForeName": "Nematollah", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banki", "ForeName": "Abdolali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nabavi", "ForeName": "Seyed F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8859-5675"], "LastName": "Nabavi", "ForeName": "Seyed M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Spinal Cord Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28594115", "10.1002/jcp.26044"]}}]}
