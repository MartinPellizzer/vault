Studies on long-term O<sub>3</sub> variations and their influencing factors are essential for understanding O<sub>3</sub> pollution and its impact. Here, we conducted an analysis of long-term variations in O<sub>3</sub> during 2006-2022\u00a0at the Longfengshan Regional Atmosphere Background Station (LFS; 44.44\u00b0N, 127.36\u00b0E, 330.5\u00a0m a.s.l.) situated on the northeastern edge of the Northeast China Plains. The maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> fluctuated substantially, with the annual MDA8 decreasing significantly during 2006-2015 (-0.62\u00a0ppb\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), jumping during 2015-2016 and increasing clearly during 2020-2022. Step multiple linear regression models for MDA8 were obtained using meteorological variables, to decompose anthropogenic and meteorological contributions to O<sub>3</sub> variations. Anthropogenic activities acted as the primary drivers of the long-term trends of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>, contributing 73% of annual MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> variability, whereas meteorology played less important roles (27%). Elevated O<sub>3</sub> at LFS were primarily associated with airflows originating from the North China Plain, Northeast China Plain, and coastal areas of North China, primarily occurring during the warm months (May-October). Based on satellite products of NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO columns, the O<sub>3</sub> photochemical regimes over LFS revealed NO<sub>x</sub>-limited throughout the period. NO<sub>2</sub> increased first, reaching peak in 2011, followed by substantial decrease; while HCHO exhibited significant increase, contributing to decreasing trend in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> during 2006-2015. The plateauing NO<sub>2</sub> and decreasing HCHO may contribute to the increase in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in 2016. Subsequently, both NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO exhibited notable fluctuations, leading to significant changes in O<sub>3</sub>. The study results fill the gap in the understanding of long-term O<sub>3</sub> trends in high-latitude areas in the Northeast China Plain and offer valuable insights for assessing the impact of O<sub>3</sub> on crop yields, forest productivity, and climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
