The degradation efficiency was evaluated in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>) and BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD under various operating conditions. Pilot experiments comprising the O<sub>3</sub>-RPB unit coupled with a biological contact oxidation unit were also carried out. The COD removal rates in the pilot process increased markedly to about 70-85% compared to about 40% in the original treatment process, which is the tertiary aerobic treatment in the plant, confirming that the O<sub>3</sub>-RPB system is very efficient in improving the biodegradability of the POM effluent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research Center of the Ministry of Education for High Gravity Engineering and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology , Beijing , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Beijing Water Business Doctor Co.
