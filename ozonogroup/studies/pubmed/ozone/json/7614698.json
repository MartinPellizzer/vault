Mice and rats were exposed to 0, 0.5 or 1.0 p.p.m. ozone by inhalation for 24 or 30 months. There was an increased incidence of lung neoplasms in B6C3F1 mice. However, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in F344/N rats. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate benign and malignant lung neoplasms from B6C3F1 mice for mutations in the K-ras gene at codons 12, 13 and 61, (ii) determine if the frequency and spectra of K-ras mutations were unique for ozone-induced lung neoplasms, (iii) determine if specific K-ras mutations were associated with the size and morphological patterns of lung neoplasms or ozone exposure concentrations and (iv) screen lung neoplasms by immunohistochemical methods for the p53 protein. K-ras mutations were detected by single-strand conformation analysis and identified by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded neoplasms. K-ras mutations were detected in 73% of ozone-induced neoplasms, as compared with 33% of lung neoplasms from controls. The predominant mutations consisted of A-->T transversions at codon 61 (8/19) and G-->T transversions at codon 12 (7/19). Specific K-ras mutations in lung neoplasms were not associated with various morphological patterns. Our data suggests that ozone may cause direct and/or indirect DNA damage in the K-ras proto-oncogene of B6C3F1 mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sills", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "H L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greenwell", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herbert", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boorman", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devereux", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["K-ras", "p53"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, p53"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, ras"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7614698", "10.1093/carcin/16.7.1623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
