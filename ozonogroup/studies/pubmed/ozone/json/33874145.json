Juvenile Douglas fir (Pseudulsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) were inoculated with Rhizopogon vinicolor A. H. Smith and Lactarius rufus (Scop.: Fr.) Fr., and allowed to grow outdoors for a period of four months. Subsequently, they were transferred to a phytotron and treated with 0 or 200\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> ozone for 28 days. During these treatments, they were watered with a solution of ammonium sulphate of concentrations corresponding to 5, SO and 200 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> , During the last three days, the trees were pulse-labelled with 14CO<sub>2</sub> . Ozone increased the amounts of <sup>14</sup> C recovered in the new needle fraction, whereas the amounts recovered in the roots and root/soil respiration tended to decrease. Mycorrhizal frequency tended to increase during ozone treatment. Ammonium sulphate did not affect the distribution pattern of <sup>14</sup> C over the trees, but seemed to stimulate the activity of the root system and mycorrhizal frequency at the intermediate nitrogen level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DLO-Institute for Soil Fertility Research, P.O.
