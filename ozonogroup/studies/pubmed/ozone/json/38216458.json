Chengdu had O<sub>3</sub> pollution days for 20 days, whereas Chongqing had no O<sub>3</sub> pollution days. In this study, we analyzed the influencing factors of this difference from the emission level of precursors and meteorological conditions. The results showed that:\u2460 the total mixing ratio of 52 VOCs (volatile organic compounds) (including 26 alkanes, 16 aromatics, and 10 alkenes) in Chengdu (18.8\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>) was 2.8 times that of Chongqing (6.6\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>), and the total O<sub>3</sub> formation potential (OFP) (51.2\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>) was 2.0 times that of Chongqing (25.0\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>). The\u00b7OH radical loss rate (<i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>) (3.9 s<sup>-1</sup>) was 1.7 times that of Chongqing (2.3 s<sup>-1</sup>). The top three OFP in Chengdu were ethylene, <i>m</i>/<i>p</i>-xylene, and isoprene, and those in Chongqing were isoprene, ethylene, and propylene. The contribution rate of alkenes to O<sub>3</sub> in Chongqing was 60.7%, whereas the OFP of alkenes and aromatics in Chengdu were 1.6 times and 2.9 times that in Chongqing. In conclusion, the total mixing ratio of VOCs, atmospheric photochemical activity, and O<sub>3</sub> formation potential of Chengdu were higher than those of Chongqing. \u2461 Isoprene was ranked first place in <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> in both Chengdu and Chongqing, indicating that the contribution of biogenic sources to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in August was significant. However, the biogenic source emission activity was in response to temperature. From August 14 to 24, the high temperature in Chongqing (38.3\u2103) decreased biogenic source emission activity, whereas the temperature in Chengdu (34.9\u2103) increased the biogenic sources emission activity. \u2462 The horizontal and vertical atmospheric diffusion conditions of Chongqing were better than those of Chengdu, and Chengdu was affected by regional pollution transmission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation&Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Mu-Lan", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation&Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-Liang", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Urban Atmospheric Environment Integrated Observation&Pollution Prevention and Control of Chongqing, Chongqing Research Academy of Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chongqing 401147, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Dan-Lin", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Qin-Wen", "Initials": "QW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38216458", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202301019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
