This study aimed to compare the pain control effect, based on the time to wound healing, of using a sitz bath with ozonised water with that of using a sitz bath with ordinary tap water in patients who have had a haemorrhoidectomy.", "Patients were divided into two equal-sized groups: Group O used a sitz bath with ozonised water after haemorrhoidectomy and patients in Group T used a sitz bath with ordinary tap water. Different concentrations (1ppm, 2ppm and 4ppm) of ozonized water were tested to determine their bactericidal activities. Pain levels were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (ranging from 0-10 where 0 is 'no pain' and 10 is 'unbearable pain'), on days two, three and seven. Cohort analysis was retrospectively performed on the prospectively randomised collected data for this study.", "A total of 80 patients participated in the study. No case showed any signs of bacterial growth. On postoperative day seven, patients in Group O showed a significantly lower pain level than those in Group T (1.35\u00b10.48 versus 2.40\u00b10.9; p<0.001). The time needed for anus scars to be completely healed was significantly shorter for Group O than that for Group T (2.75\u00b10.63 weeks versus 3.85\u00b10.80 weeks; p<0.001).", "The results of this study showed that using a sitz bath with ozonised water reduced pain and accelerated healing in patients who have had a haemorrhoidectomy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Ajou University School of Medicine, 164 World cup-ro, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16499, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Joo Hyung", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Services Administration, University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720, 2nd Ave S, Birmingham, AL, 35294, US."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dae Hyun", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul Clinical Laboratories, A-dong, Heungdok IT valley 13, Heungdeok 1-ro, Giheung-gu, Yongin, 16954, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Baik", "ForeName": "Sae Yun", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Hanvit Hospital, 1017 Gyeongsu-daero, Jangan-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16300, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yong Pyo", "Initials": "YP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Wound Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9417080", "ISSNLinking": "0969-0700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Baths"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemorrhoidectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain, Postoperative"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Wound"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32421480", "10.12968/jowc.2020.29.5.289"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
