At 248 nm, the dissociation is well described as impulsive in nature with all rotational states exhibiting similarly large, near-limiting values for the bipolar moments describing their angular momentum alignment and orientation. At 265 nm, however, the angular momentum polarization parameters determined for consecutive odd and even rotational states exhibit clear differences. Studies at the intermediate wavelength of 260 nm strongly suggest that such a difference in the angular momentum polarization is speed dependent and this proposal is consistent with the angular momentum polarization parameters extracted and reported previously for longer photolysis wavelengths [G. Hancock et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 5, 5386 (2003); S. J. Horrocks et al., J. Chem. Phys. 126, 044308 (2007)]. The alternation of angular momentum polarization for successive odd and even J states may be a consequence of the different mechanisms leading to the formation of the two O2 (a 1Deltag) Lambda doublets. Specifically, the involvement of out of plane parent rotational motion is proposed as the origin for the observed depolarization for the Delta- relative to the Delta+ state."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, The University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QZ, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horrocks", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ritchie", "ForeName": "G A D", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharples", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17887838", "10.1063/1.2775453"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
