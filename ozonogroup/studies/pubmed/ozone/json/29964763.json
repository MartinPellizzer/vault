The concentrations, compositions, and seasonal variation of VOCs were measured in 2012 at Changbai Mountain Forest Ecosystem Research Station, a remote station in Northeast China. Weekly samples were collected in the Changbai Mountain area and analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the annual mean concentration of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 10.7\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\u00b16.2\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Halohydrocarbon was the most abundant component, accounting for 37% of the total VOCs, followed by alkanes and aromatics, accounting for 33% and 15% respectively, and alkenes accounted for 15%. The seasonal variation of TVOCs in this area was obvious, and the order was spring >autumn >summer >winter. TVOCs concentration in spring was very significantly higher than those in any other season (<i>P</i><0.05). The principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the sources of the VOCs. Five sources were resolved by the PCA, including traffic sources, LPG,biogenic sources, combustion sources, industrial sources and regional transportation. The HYSPLIT-4.0 model was used to analyze the effect of pollutant transport, and the results indicated that the transport of pollutants from southwest had a significant effect on the increase of VOCs concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fang-Kun", "Initials": "FK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Gui-Qian", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-Si", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964763", "10.13227/j.hjkx.2016.09.008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
