A recirculating loop of 6-in diameter unlined ductile iron pipe was used to simulate turbulent flow conditions in a pipe with significant corrosion and tubercle buildup. Conventionally treated test water was subjected to either ozonation, carbon adsorption (GAC), reverse osmosis (RO) or no further treatment before being chlorinated and introduced into the pipeline simulator. Results showed that overall chlorine decay in the simulator was consistently dominated by wall reactions whose first-order rate constants were an order of magnitude higher than those for the bulk water. With free chlorine, the wall rate constants for ozonated and GAC-treated water were about twice those of conventional or RO-treated water. This behavior is believed due to the effect that changes in the organic content of water have on its ability to complex iron and the effect that changes in water conductivity have on pipe wall corrosion. Tests run with chloraminated water showed no statistically significant effect of treatment type and had wall rate constants that were only 40 to 70% as high as those using free chlorine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, 26 W.
