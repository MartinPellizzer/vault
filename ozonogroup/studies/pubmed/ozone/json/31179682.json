At 120 min reaction time, Co/MCM-48 and Ce/MCM-48 showed 46.6 and 63.8% mineralization for clofibric acid (CA) degradation, respectively. Less than 33% mineralization was achieved with Co/MCM-48 and Ce/MCM-48 during sulfamethazine (SMZ) ozonation. In the presence of monometallic oxides modified MCM-48 catalysts, total organic carbon (TOC) removal of diclofenac sodium (DCF) was around 80%. The composite Co-Ce/MCM-48 catalyst exhibited significantly higher activity in terms of TOC removal of CA (83.6%), SMZ (51.7%) and DCF (86.8%). Co-Ce/MCM-48 inhibited efficiently the accumulation of small molecular carboxyl acids during ozonation. A detailed research was conducted to detect the nature of material structure and mechanism of catalytic ozonation by using a series of characterizations. The main reaction pathway of CA was determined by the analysis of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, in line with the results of frontier electron density calculations that reactive oxygen species (ROSs) were easy to attack negative regions of pharmaceuticals. The Si-O-Si, Co\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7HO-Si-O-Si-OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce, and O<sub>3</sub>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Co-HO-Si-O-Si-OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce-OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O<sub>3</sub> basic units in catalysts were constructed to detect the orbit-energy-level difference. The results revealed that a synergistic effect existed at the interface between cobalt and cerium oxides over MCM-48, which facilitated the ROSs sequence in solution with ozone. Therefore, the multivalence redox coupling of Ce<sup>4+</sup>/Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup> along with electron transfer played an important role in catalytic ozonation process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment , South China Normal University , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shangyi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment , South China Normal University , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Drinking Water Safety , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment , Ministry of Education, Higher Education Mega Center , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xukai", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment , South China Normal University , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Haotian", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment , South China Normal University , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xianglin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment , South China Normal University , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment , Ministry of Education, Higher Education Mega Center , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Fenglong", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment , Nanjing Normal University , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Limin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment , Nanjing Normal University , Nanjing 210023 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment , South China Normal University , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Drinking Water Safety , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment , Ministry of Education, Higher Education Mega Center , Guangzhou 510006 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-2091-4382"], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Laisheng", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "144O8QL0L1", "NameOfSubstance": "Diclofenac"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G0H8C9362", "NameOfSubstance": "Cobalt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "619G5K328Y", "NameOfSubstance": "ceric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cobalt"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diclofenac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31179682", "10.1021/acsami.9b02143"]}}]}
