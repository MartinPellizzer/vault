The classification results showed three pollution periods: severe (December, January and February), ozone (May\u2012August), and slight (March and November). These features were combined with potential source contribution function (PSCF), concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) and backward trajectory model (HYSPLIT) for simulating spatio-temporal trajectory of air polluted during each pollution periods. The results show that PM<sub>2.5</sub> mainly comes from CD and surrounding cities, and some may be from India, Myanmar and Chongqing; PM<sub>10</sub> mainly comes from CD and surrounding cities and some may be from India and Myanmar; NO<sub>2</sub> mainly comes from CD and surrounding cities and cities and Some of the pollution may come from the input of India, Myanmar, Chongqing and Inner Mongolia; O<sub>3</sub> mainly comes from the urban agglomeration of Sichuan Basin and some areas from Chongqing, Sichuan Liangshan and Yunnan Guizhou. Combined with the meteorological data of temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, aerosol optical depth, planetary boundary layer height and thermal anomaly data, the Monthly, daily and hourly spatio-temporal characteristics and the possible occurred cause of the main air pollution during each pollution period in CD were revealed detail. The research in this paper is critical for pollution control and prevention and provides a scientific basis for studying the spatio-temporal characteristics and sources of pollution in megacities in terrain such as basins and mountains.<i>Implications:</i> Air pollution has a significant impact on human and ecological health. In 2013, Chengdu was one of the five cities with the most serious PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in the world. In the previous study of air pollution in Chengdu, it was only for a short period of pollution. It is impossible to fully understand the spatio-temporal trajectory and cause of air pollution. Chengdu is surrounded by mountains, and the meteorological conditions have been stagnant for a long time. The research on the spatio-temporal evolution of the main air pollution trajectories in each pollution period in Chengdu is particularly important. Quantifying the pollution trajectory and air pollution concentration is helpful to fully understand the air quality in Chengdu. The comprehensive analysis of multi-source data such as air pollution and meteorology has focused on strengthening the in-depth research on the transmission law of air pollution, the spatio-temporal change trend of air pollution, the sources of air pollution and the causes of air pollution, so as to help people fully understand the sources and causes of pollution in Chengdu. Aiming at the trajectory law, causes and occurrence time of air pollution, it is conducive for the government to formulate corresponding policies, carry out regional emission reduction and joint prevention and control, improve air quality and minimize the harm of air pollution to the public."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Engineering and Technology, Chengdu University of Technology, Leshan, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geomathematics Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xingjie", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geomathematics Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Physics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geomathematics Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Physics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geophysics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geomathematics Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Physics, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bingli", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35358021", "10.1080/10962247.2022.2058642"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
