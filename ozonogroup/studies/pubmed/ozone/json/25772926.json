Chlorhexidine (CHX), propolis (PRO), ozonated water (OW), gaseous ozone (OG) and KTP laser were used for this purpose.", "Twelve primary molar teeth were used in this study. One-third of the teeth (from coronal portion) were removed to obtain flat surfaces. After applying the cavity-disinfectants, an adhesive (prime and bond NT) was applied to dentin surfaces, and composite crowns were built up. One group received no pretreatment and was set as a control (CONT). Ten sticks were obtained from these samples and were stressed in tension until failure using a universal testing machine and the data were recorded.", "The mean strength values (in MPa) of the sticks were OW (11.12) > KTP (9.58) > CHX (7.58) > PRO (7.42) > CONT (6.38) > OG (5.84) and OW showed significantly higher results than the other groups, except KTP group (P < 0.05).", "OW and KTP might be used safely without compromising the bond strength of restorative materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University, Faculty of Dentistry, Sivas/Turkiye, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Oznurhan", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ozturk", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ekci", "ForeName": "E Sungurtekin", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12690-20-9", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium titanylphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin-Bonding Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Molar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tensile Strength"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25772926", "10.4103/1119-3077.151774", "NigerJClinPract_2015_18_3_400_151774"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
