The purpose of the present work is to determine how the lymph nodes and lungs of a mutant strain of animal, which lacks this type of cell, differ in their response to ozone exposure when compared with animals that possess a normal complement of lymphocytes. We exposed athymic nude (nu/nu) mice or heterozygous (nu/+) euthymic mice to 0.7 ppm ozone for 20 h/d for 7 or 14 d while maintaining control groups in clean air. At 7 d the lymph-node hyperplastic response normally seen in euthymic, ozone-exposed animals was greatly reduced in exposed athymic animals. By both 7 and 14 d, greater damage had occurred in the lungs of ozone-exposed, athymic animals than in similarly exposed euthymic animals. Lung wet weight divided by body weight, which was used as a general indicator of lung damage, increased by substantially more in athymic animals than in conventional animals. In a parallel manner, quantitative microscopic analysis, a more sensitive indicator, revealed a marked increase in the lung lesion volumes. Qualitative histologic analysis showed that the change in the response in the athymic animal was most prominent in the peripheral region of the lung extending from the alveolar duct to the alveoli, and was characterized by a greater acute inflammatory cell reaction. Possible mechanisms by which the T-cell could produce the observed effect include secretion of factors that enhance inherent resistance of the lung's target cells, or alterations in the way the inflammatory response to ozone-mediated damage occurs. The results support the idea that the mediastinal lymph node lymphocyte response is adaptive in nature and aids in protecting the lung from ozone-mediated effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dziedzic", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heterozygote"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Homozygote"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymph Nodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3494850", "10.1080/15287398709531002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
