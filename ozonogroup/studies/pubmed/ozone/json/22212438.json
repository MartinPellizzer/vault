The ozone-initiated reaction products of limonene, an abundant VOC, were used as a model of indoor air mixtures to study upper airway (sensory) irritation, bronchoconstrictive and alveolar level effects after repeated exposures. Mice were exposed 1h/day for 10 consecutive days to: air, limonene (52 ppm/289 mg/m(3)); ozone (0.1 ppm/0.2mg/m(3)); a reaction mixture of limonene (52\u00b18 ppm) and ozone (0.5, 2.5 and 3.9 ppm) resulting in ~0.05 ppm residual ozone. Neither the limonene nor the ozone exposures alone showed consistent effects on the respiratory parameters. In the limonene/ozone groups, the respiratory rate decreased concentration-dependently with an extrapolated no-effect-level of ~0.3 ppm admixed ozone. Both sensory irritation and airflow limitation were conspicuous effects of the mixtures; sensory irritation appeared rapidly and airflow limitation developed slowly during each exposure. The effects of these parameters did not change with increasing number of exposures. No firm conclusion could be drawn about alveolar level effects. Cells in bronchoalveolar lavage were unchanged irrespective of exposure to air, ozone, and limonene with and without ozone. In conclusion, the study indicated that repeated exposures to ozone-initiated limonene mixtures did not cause sensitization of sensory irritation and airflow limitation. Bronchoalveolar lavage after exposures to ozone, and limonene with and without ozone, respectively, did not show airway inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
