The study sites were located on the NW-SE transect through the Western (12 sites), Eastern (11 sites) and Southern (3 sites) Carpathians in forest ecosystems typical of each area. Some of the forest monitoring sites were located in national parks, biosphere reserves and areas of protected landscape. Each permanent site of 0.7 ha area consisted of 5 small 500m(2) circular plots, arranged in the form of a cross, i.e. four placed on the cardinal points (N, E, S, W) and one in the center. Phytosociological records were done twice during the 1998 growing season using the Braun-Blanquet's method. The study sites represented various types of forest: Picea abies stands (8), beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands (10), fir (Abies alba) stands (2) and mixed beech-fir, spruce-fir and beech-spruce stands (6). Age of most stands was 80-100 years. Degree of crown damage varied greatly between sites, a percentage of damaged trees decrease in Carpathians from West to East. It corresponds well with the O(3) level in these areas. Typical damage by O(3) in herb layer species in several Carpathian sites were found. Land-use map for the entire Carpathian Mountains and two detailed land use maps for Tatras (Western Carpathians) and Retezat (Southern Carpathians) are presented. A little more than half of the Carpathian territory is forested. The most densely forested are Eastern Carpathians, while the most sparsely Western Carpathians. Arable lands occupy 22.6% of the Carpathians, pastures and meadows 6.2%, water bodies 1.9%, and build up areas several percent. In the highest elevation of the Carpathians alpine meadows (11.3%) and rocks (3.5%) are distributed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Polish Academy of Sciences, 31-512 Krak\u00f3w, Lubicz Str. 46, Cracow, Poland. grodzin@ibpost.ib-pan.krakow.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grodzi\u0144ska", "ForeName": "Krystyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Godzik", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fraczek", "ForeName": "Witold", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Badea", "ForeName": "Ovidiu", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oszl\u00e1nyi", "ForeName": "J\u00falius", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Postelnicu", "ForeName": "Daniela", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shparyk", "ForeName": "Yuriy", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Renewal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15046837", "10.1016/j.envpol.2003.10.031", "S0269749103004123"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
