However, the joint effect of multiple air pollutants on lipid profiles and the role of each pollutant are still unclear. This panel study aims to investigate and compare the overall associations of major air pollutants with lipid parameters in obese and normal-weight adults, and assess the relative importance of each pollutant for lipid parameters. Forty-four obese and 53 normal-weight young adults were recruited from December 2017 to June 2018 in Beijing, China. Their fasting blood was collected and serum lipid levels were measured in three visits. Six major air pollutants were included in this study, which were PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and CO. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was implemented to estimate the joint effect of the six air pollutants on various lipid parameters. We found that decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the obese group and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-C in the normal-weight group were associated with the exposure to the mixture of six air pollutants above. Significant increases in total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C were observed in both groups, and the effect was stronger in obese group. Of the six air pollutants above, O<sub>3</sub> had the largest posterior inclusion probability in above lipid indices, ranging from 0.75 to 1.00. In the obese group, approximately linear exposure-response relationships were observed over the whole range of logarithmic O<sub>3</sub>-8\u00a0h max concentration, while in the normal-weight group, these relationships existed when the logarithmic concentration exceeded about 2.8. Therefore, lipid profiles of obese adults may be more sensitive to air pollution and this study highlights the importance of strengthening emissions control efforts for O<sub>3</sub> in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
