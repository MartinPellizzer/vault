Recent research has also indicated that nitrous acid (HONO) can be emitted in significant quantities from soil microbial activities. However, only a few studies have quantified emissions of HONO along with NO from a wide range of soil types. In this study, we measured emissions of HONO and NO from soil samples collected from 48 sites across China and found much higher emissions of HONO than of NO, especially for samples from northern China. We performed a meta-analysis of 52 field studies in China, which revealed that long-term fertilization increased the abundance of nitrite-producing genes much more than the abundance of NO-producing genes. This promotion effect was greater in northern China than in southern China. In simulations using a chemistry transport model with laboratory-derived parametrization, we found that HONO emissions had a greater effect than NO emissions on air quality. Moreover, we determined that with projected continuous reductions in anthropogenic emissions, the contribution from soils to maximum 1 h concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and ozone and daily average concentrations of particulate nitrate in the Northeast Plain will increase to 17%, 4.6%, and 14%, respectively. Our findings highlight the need to consider HONO in the assessment of the loss of reactive oxidized nitrogen from soils to the atmosphere and its effect on air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 999077 Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yanan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, 518055 Shenzhen, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4765-9377"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 999077 Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6593-570X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, 100871 Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jianmin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Environmental Pollution Prediction and Control, Gansu Province, College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University, 730000 Lanzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8839-8345"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth System Science, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Meta-Analysis", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36802547", "10.1021/acs.est.2c07793"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
