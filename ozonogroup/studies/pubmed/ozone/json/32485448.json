Three decontaminating units (SCAVENGER\u2122), which have the capacity to inject up to 120\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/h and 250 Kg O<sub>2</sub>/h in the form of microbubbles (90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter), were placed in the contaminated Valsequillo reservoir, Central Mexico. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment, 20 physicochemical parameters, 18 organic compounds, 66 inorganic compounds and 11 biological indicators were measured before, during and after the treatment; all of them in several representative sites of the east side of the Valsequillo reservoir. After 5\u00a0months of operating the SCAVENGER\u2122 units in the eastern part of the reservoir, the concentration of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) increased 68%. Likewise, the chemical reducing conditions of the reservoir reflected by the low oxidation-reduction potential (ORP; -237\u00a0\u00b1\u00a075\u00a0mV) became quasi-oxidant (10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058\u00a0mV). The treatment was efficient in water disinfection, presenting an 80% reduction in Fecal Coliforms (FC). Some heavy metals also showed a decrease in their concentration, being as follows: Al (65%), Cr (35%), Pb (46%), Zn (60%), Mn (20%), Mo (40%), Fe (32%), As (58%) and Co (26%). Due to the selective reactivity of ozone towards aliphatic and aromatic unsaturated compounds, several organic compounds reduced in their concentration by up to two orders of magnitude. Based on the above, it is evident that the treatment with ozone and oxygen was effective in substantially improving the quality of water in the east side of the Valsequillo reservoir."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
