As the conventional wastewater treatment plants cannot stably remove these EDCs, post-treatment with advanced chemical oxidation methods such as ozonation are proven effective to further remove EDCs, but this additional treatment increase the wastewater treatment cost, which is impractical for worldwide application. To find potential alternative effective method, this work presents the importance of EDCs conjugates. Specifically, two important facts are described: 1) concentrations of EDCs conjugates in raw municipal wastewater vary with temperature, and their existence results in underestimated removal performance of WWTPs; 2) Strategies to enhance the cleavage rates of EDCs conjugates are most effective to improve the observed removal performance of conventional WWTPs on EDCs. Further work should be performed to check whether effective solutions can be found to increase their cleavage rates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
