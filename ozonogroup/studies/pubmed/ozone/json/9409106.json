The purpose of this study was to evaluate the absorptive properties of UV tints in CR-39 lenses.", "We used a spectrophotometer to measure the UV transmittance of three groups of UV tinted CR-39 lenses, including (1) lenses tinted by local optical laboratories: (2) lenses tinted by us, using commercially available dyes: and (3) stock UV lenses that have UV absorptive molecules throughout the lens. We also tested the durability of these tints to daily washing/drying by measuring their UV transmittance characteristics at 3, 6, and 12 months.", "All the tested lenses absorbed all of the UV-B and at least 99% of UV-A. The durability of these UV tints when exposed to daily washing/drying was excellent: all lenses continued to absorb all of the UV-B and at least 99% of UV-A after 1 year.", "These data suggest that UV tinted CR-39 lenses provide protection against UV radiation that meets the ANSI Z80.3-1996 Standard for non-prescription sunglasses and fashion eyewear. Furthermore, normal daily washing/drying for 1 year does not cause a significant decrease in the protective effect of the UV tint."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Illinois College of Optometry, Chicago, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "D Y", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "W L", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trachimowicz", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Optom Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "7505575", "ISSNLinking": "0003-0244"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Durable Medical Equipment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Eyeglasses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Lenses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materials Testing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9409106"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
