Thus, a pyrrolic \u03b2-carbon with its alkyl substituent was excised and replaced by an oxygen atom, and the neighboring \u03b2-carbon was hydroxylated. This work clarifies the nature of the products first described by Fischer and De\u017eeli\u0107, in 1933, and verifies the work by Shulg'a and coworkers, from 1977. Furthermore, the chemistry of the oxazolochlorin hemiacetals was studied: They could be dehydroxylated or converted to alkyl acetals and gem-dialkyl derivatives, all possessing chlorin-type optical spectra. Their oxidative conversions generated a unique tetrahydrofuran-linked oxazolochlorin dimer and a hexaethylporpholactone. The work expands on the knowledge of converting porphyrins to porphyrinoids of potential utility containing nonpyrrolic building heterocycles."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
