The adsorption capacity of GAC for 2,4-DCP was not influenced by the humic substances preloaded to have equilibrium concentration of 24.9mg Cl(-1) (14.5mg Cg(-1)). The adsorption capacity of GAC for 2,4-DCP decreased to one tenth of new GAC after the first adsorption-extraction step because of only 16% desorption in the first step. However, 2,4-DCP adsorbed on GAC was completely extracted after the second step suggesting that GAC can be used as adsorbent to transfer 2,4-DCP from water to acetic acid. The concentration ratio of 2,4-DCP from water into acetic acid was around 2x10(5), whereas the concentration ratio of humic substances was about 3.5, indicating that 2,4-DCP was selectively adsorbed and extracted by this system. The first order degradation rate constant for 2,4-DCP by ozone in acetic acid increased with the addition of humic substances. The rate constant with 16mg Cl(-1) of humic substances was 2.6 times as high as that without humic substances. Humic substances behaved as a promoter for the degradation of 2,4-DCP by ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Material Science and Chemical System Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, 1-4-1 Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima City, Hiroshima 739-8527, Japan. okawa@fukuoka-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okawa", "ForeName": "Kiyokazu", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakano", "ForeName": "Yoichi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishijima", "ForeName": "Wataru", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "Mitsumasa", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R669TG1950", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-dichlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15504485", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.08.009", "S0045-6535(04)00686-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
