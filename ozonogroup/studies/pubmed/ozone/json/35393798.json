The Spring Festival of 2020 was affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia epidemic:companies stopped work and production, and traffic was restricted, providing scientific experimentation opportunities for pollutant emission reduction research. This study analyzed the variety of the composition, chemical reaction activity, and sources of VOCs in the Pearl River Delta during the Spring Festival and the epidemic control period, using real-time online monitoring data of VOCs obtained at four sites(Guangzhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, and Duanfen)in the Pearl River Delta from January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020. The results showed that during the Spring Festival and the epidemic control period, the average of <i>\u03c6</i> (VOCs) in the Pearl River Delta was 15.89\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, and the maximum hourly average concentration was 45.43\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, values that were 44% and 60% lower, respectively, than those before the Spring Festival holiday. Among the VOCs component concentration decreases, the aromatic hydrocarbon component decreased the most, and the decrease in the urban area of the Pearl River Delta (74%) was significantly greater than that in the suburban area (56%). As a result, the contribution rate of aromatic hydrocarbons to the total VOCs was reduced to less than 10%. The analysis of the\u00b7OH reaction activity of VOCs(<i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>)and ozone formation potential(OFP)showed that the <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> and OFP of VOCs decreased significantly in the Pearl River Delta during the Spring Festival and the epidemic control period. Compared with those before the Spring Festival holiday, the total <i>L</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub> and total OFP decreased by an average of 60% and 63% in the urban area of the Pearl River Delta, respectively. Additionally, the atmospheric oxidation had also been significantly reduced, which showed a 28% decrease in <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub><i>x</i></sub>). The ratio of toluene/benzene showed that the influence of industrial sources had almost disappeared during the Spring Festival and the epidemic control period, and the total points of the representative components of industrial-related solvent-use sources such as toluene, ethylbenzene, and <i>m/p</i>-xylene dropped by 72% to 91%. The results of this study suggest that solvent-use sources and vehicle exhaust emission sources are the current sources of VOCs that need to be paid attention to in the prevention and control of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the Pearl River Delta region, and the impact of petrochemical sources cannot be ignored in the work of further reducing the background concentration of O<sub>3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Regional Air Quality Monitoring, Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Regional Air Quality Monitoring, Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Luan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Regional Air Quality Monitoring, Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Li-Rong", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Regional Air Quality Monitoring, Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Guangzhou 510308, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongguan Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Dongguan 523000, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Hong-Bo", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhongshan Sub-branch of Guangdong Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Zhongshan 528400, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Man-Ya", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou OnePoint Environmental Consultant Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510220, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cheng-Liu", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Holidays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35393798", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202106240"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
