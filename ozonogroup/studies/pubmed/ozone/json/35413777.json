The growth promotion effect of mycelium was as follows: alkali pretreatment\u00a0>\u00a0alkali combined with ozone pretreatment\u00a0>\u00a0ozone pretreatment\u00a0>\u00a0high-temperature water pretreatment (control). The highest cellulose degradation (35.38%) was observed in alkali pretreatment group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while the maximum lignin loss of 28.10% was reached in the ozone pretreatment group. Correlation analysis showed that both cellulose and lignin could be used as carbon sources to promote mycelium growth, but the effect of cellulose was better. High activities of \u03b2-glucosidase (2.92\u00a0IU/g) and filter paper enzyme (2.92\u00a0IU/g) were observed in alkali pretreatment group on Day 6 and 8, respectively, which were significantly correlated with the change of cellulose degradation rate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
