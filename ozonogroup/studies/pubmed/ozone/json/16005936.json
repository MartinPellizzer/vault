Due to the public health risk caused by the presence of bromate as a suspected carcinogen, attention had been addressed to the conditions under which bromate is formed. In this study, photoanodic bromine generation and bromate (BrO(3)(-)) formation were investigated using a TiO(2) electrode in a photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) treatment process. The separation of anodic and cathodic reactions in the PEC system resulted in a pH decrease from 9.3 to 3.0 in the photoanode compartment and an increase to 11.0 in the cathode compartment. Under a photo-illumination intensity of 5.7 m W cm(-2) UV, a biasing potential of +1.0V vs SCE, a pH of 6.0 and at a NaBr concentration of 1.0 x 10(-2) M, active bromine formation increased over time with 2.4 x 10(-6) M min(-6) rate and reached a steady-state concentration of 1.44 x 10(-4) M in 60 min. Bromate formation was detected after a lag-period of 15 min and exhibited a continuous increasing trend with respect to irradiation time. No bromate formation was observed below pH 6.5 whereas an increasing bromate concentrations and pH up to pH=8.5 were noted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Pamukkale University, 20017 Kinikli/Denizli, Turkey. selcukh@pamukkale.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selcuk", "ForeName": "Huseyin", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarikaya", "ForeName": "Hasan Z", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bekbolet", "ForeName": "Miray", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "Marc A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16005936", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.04.086", "S0045-6535(05)00663-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
