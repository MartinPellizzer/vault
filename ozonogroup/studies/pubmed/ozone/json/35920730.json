Here, we reveal and compare the environmental hazards of aquatic macro- and microplastic debris through a holistic life cycle assessment approach. Compared to polymeric debris, microplastics, especially smaller than 10 \u03bcm, exhibit higher freshwater ecotoxicity enhanced by watersheds' high average depth and low water temperature. High microplastic concentration within drainage basins can also cause air pollution regarding particulate matter formation and photochemical ozone formation. The environmental drawbacks of plastic mismanagement are then demonstrated by showing that the microplastic formulation and removal in drinking water treatment plants can pose more than 7.44% of the total ecotoxicity effect from plastic wastes' (microplastics') whole life cycle. Specifically, these two life cycle stages can also cause more than 50% of the plastic wastes' life cycle ecotoxicity effect related to organic chemical emissions. Therefore, reducing environmentally harmful plastic losses through advanced plastic waste recycling, collection, and effective microplastic removal technologies needs future investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Systems Engineering, College of Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9609-4299"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Systems Engineering, College of Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, United States."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Fengqi", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microplastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Cycle Stages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microplastics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35920730", "10.1021/acs.est.2c01549"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
