This component of the terrestrial solar spectrum would be intensified if the atmospheric ozone layer were reduced. A method for calculating and statistically analyzing relative crowding coefficients was developed and used to evaluate the competitive status of the species pairs sown in a modified replacement series. The effect of the supplementary UV-B irradiance was generally detrimental to plant growth, and was reflected in decreased leaf area, biomass, height and density as well as changes in competitive balance for various species. For some species, interspecific competition apparently accentuated the effect of the UV-B radiation, while more intense intraspecific competition may have had the same effect for other species. A few species when grown in a situation of more severe mutual interspecific competition exhibited enhanced growth under the UV-B radiation treatment. This, however, was usually associated with a detrimental effect of the radiation on its competitor and thus was likely the result of its improved competitive circumstance rather than a beneficial physiological effect of the radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Range Science, Utah State University, 84322, Logan, UT, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Ecology Center, Utah State University, 84322, Logan, UT, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fox", "ForeName": "Fred M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Range Science, Utah State University, 84322, Logan, UT, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Ecology Center, Utah State University, 84322, Logan, UT, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caldwell", "ForeName": "Martyn M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1976 Oct;58(4):563-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16659718"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 Jul;60(1):165-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16660029"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28309126", "10.1007/BF00349807", "10.1007/BF00349807"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
