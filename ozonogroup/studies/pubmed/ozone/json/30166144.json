Unwaxed Fuji apples of commercially acceptable maturity were inoculated with 6.0-7.0 Log<sub>10</sub>\u202fCFU L.\u00a0innocua/apple, and subjected to refrigerated air (RA, 33\u202f\u00b0F), controlled atmosphere (CA, 33\u202f\u00b0F, 2% O<sub>2</sub>, 1% CO<sub>2</sub>), or CA with low doses of ozone gas (50.0\u202f-87.0\u202fppb\u202f) storage in a commercial facility for 30 weeks. A set of uninoculated apples was simultaneously subjected to the above storage conditions for total plate count and yeasts and molds enumeration. L.\u00a0innocua survival under RA and CA storage was similar, which led to 2.5-3.0 Log<sub>10</sub>\u202fCFU/apple reduction during storage. Continuous gaseous ozone application decreased L.\u00a0innocua population on Fuji apples to \u223c1.0 Log<sub>10</sub>\u202fCFU/apple after 30-week storage, and suppressed apple native flora. CA storage delayed apple fruit ripening through reduction of apple firmness and titratable acidity loss, and low dose gaseous ozone application had no negative influence on apple visual quality, including both external and internal disorders. In summary, L.\u00a0innocua decreased on Fuji apple surfaces during commercial long-term RA and CA storage. Ozone gas has the potential to be used as a supplemental intervention method to control Listeria spp. and to ensure fresh apple safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
