Specifically, a ZrO2:B thin film deposited on a hydrophobic layer becomes superhydrophilic following ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment, whereas the same treatment has no effect on the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic layer alone. Investigation of the ZrO2:B/hydrophobic interface layer using angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR XPS) confirmed it to be chemically bonded like glue. Using the multifunctional nature of the ZrO2:B thin film, flexible amorphous indium oxide (In2O3) thin-film transistors (TFTs) were subsequently fabricated on a polyimide substrate along with a ZrO2:B/poly-4-vinylphenol (PVP) dielectric. An aqueous In2O3 solution was successfully coated onto the ZrO2:B/PVP dielectric, and the surface and chemical properties of the PVP and ZrO2:B thin films were analyzed by contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface-engineered PVP dielectric was found to have a lower leakage current density (Jleak) of 4.38 \u00d7 10(-8) A/cm(2) at 1 MV/cm, with no breakdown behavior observed up to a bending radius of 5 mm. In contrast, the electrical characteristics of the flexible amorphous In2O3 TFT such as on/off current ratio (Ion/off) and electron mobility remained similar up to 10 mm of bending without degradation, with the device being nonactivated at a bending radius of 5 mm. These results suggest that ZrO2:B thin films could be used for low-temperature, solution-processed surface-modified flexible devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Engineering, Yonsei University , Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jee Ho", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Jin Young", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Sun Woong", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tae Il", "Initials": "TI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baik", "ForeName": "Hong Koo", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25664940", "10.1021/acsami.5b00036"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
