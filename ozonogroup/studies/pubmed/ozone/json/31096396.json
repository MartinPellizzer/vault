However, few studies have considered the potential ozone generation caused by VOCs emitted from sewage sludge composting plants. This study investigated the VOC emissions from a full-scale composting plant. Five major treatment units of the composting plant were chosen as the monitoring locations, including the dewatered room, dewatered sludge, blender room, fermentation workshop, and product units. The fermentation workshop units displayed the highest concentration of VOC emissions at 2595.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1367.3\u202f\u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup>, followed by the blender room, product, dewatered sludge, and dewatered room units, whose emissions ranged from 142.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f86.8\u202f\u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup> to 2107.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1045.6\u202f\u03bcg.m<sup>-3</sup>. The detected VOC families included oxygenated compounds, alkanes, alkenes, sulfide compounds, halogenated compounds, and aromatic compounds. Oxygenated compounds, particularly acetone, were the most abundant compounds in all samples. Principal component analysis revealed that the dewatered room and dewatered sludge units clustered closely, as indicated by their similar component emissions. The product units differed from the other sampling units, as their typical compounds were methanethiol, styrene, carbon disulfide, and hexane, all of which were the products of the latter stages of composting. Among the treatment units, the fermentation workshop units had the highest propylene equivalent (propy-equiv) concentration. Dimethyl disulfide and limonene were the major contributors. Limonene had the highest propy-equiv concentration, which contributed to the increased atmospheric reactivity and ozone formation potential in the surrounding air. To control the secondary environmental pollution caused by the VOC emissions during sewage sludge composting, the emission of limonene and dimethyl disulfide must be controlled from the blender room and fermentation workshop units."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
