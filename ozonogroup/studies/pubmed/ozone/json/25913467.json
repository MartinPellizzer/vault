CRBR with acclimated biomasses could efficiently remove catechol and its related COD from wastewater at organic loading rate (OLR) of 7.82\u00a0kg COD/m(3).d (HRT of 9\u00a0h). Then, OLR increased to 15.64\u00a0kg COD/m(3).d (HRT of 4.5\u00a0h) and CRBR failed. Catalytic ozonation process (COP) used as a pre-treatment and could improve the performance of the failed CRBR. The overall removal efficiency of the combined process attained respective steady states of 91% and 79% for degradation and COD removal of catechol. Therefore, the combined process is more effective in degradation and COD removal of catechol; it is also a viable alternative for upgrading industrial wastewater treatment plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
