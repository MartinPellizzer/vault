Removal of algae, change and removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disinfection by products (DBPs) control during the preozonation enhanced coagulation treatments in the jar-scale and pilot-scale experiment were studied. Algae activity (AA) was measured and used to elucidate the mechanisms of algae removal by above treatments. Results show that algae removal can be improved distinctively by proper preozonation, as the ozone dose 1.0 mg x L(-1), for instance. Algae removal could be increased from 55%-85% by traditional coagulation to 95% by enhanced coagulation after preozonation; and the best removal achieved 99.3% with ozone 1.0 mg x L(-1) and PACl 3.0 mg x L(-1); the residual THMFP (Trihalomethanes formation potential) was lowered from 117 microg x L(-1) by traditional coagulation to 46 microg x L(-1). But higher dose of ozone (as > or = 2.0 mg x L(-1)) impairs organic matter removal, although it decreases algae activity further. Significant differences were found in algae removal by AA detection between ozonation and traditional coagulation. Traditional coagulation had little effect on AA no matter the different PAC1 doses; while AA decreased clearly after ozonation. AA was lowered below 12 under 0.5-2.0 mg x L(-1) ozonation; and it kept decreasing with increase of ozone dosage. During the following coagulation, coagulant or some of its hydrolysised components enhanced the AA decrease by ozonation. Compared to the method of normal microscopy counting, AA test expresses the influence of algae living state by water treatment processes more clearly; which would provide treatment process designer with more distinct information about algae removal mechanisms and how to arrange the treatment processes to improve algae removal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Sciences and Resources, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, China. hlliu827@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hai-Long", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhi-Yong", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zheng-Jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Fang-Qin", "Initials": "FQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eukaryota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19774984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
