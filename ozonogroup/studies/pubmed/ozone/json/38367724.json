However, the reason for the decrease in grain nitrogen (N) accumulation caused by O<sub>3</sub> and whether EDU serves as N fertilizer remain unclear. An experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of factorial combinations of O<sub>3</sub> enrichment (ambient air plus 60\u00a0ppb) and EDU (foliage spray with 450\u00a0ppm solutions) on N concentration, accumulation and remobilization in hybrid rice seedlings. Compared to ambient condition, elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly inhibited the N accumulation in vegetative organs during anthesis and grain N accumulation during the maturity stage. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased the total N accumulation during anthesis and maturity stages, with a greater impact at the latter stage. The decrease in grain N accumulation caused by O<sub>3</sub> was attributed to a decrease in N remobilization of vegetative organs during the grain filling period as well as to a decrease in post-anthesis N uptake. However, there was no significant change in the proportion of N remobilization and N uptake in grain N accumulation. The inhibitory effect of O<sub>3</sub> on N remobilization in the upper canopy leaves was greater than that in the lower canopy leaves. In addition, elevated O<sub>3</sub> increased the N accumulation of panicles at the anthesis stage, mainly by resulting in earlier heading of rice. EDU only increased N accumulation at the maturity stage, which was mainly attributed to an increase in rice biomass by EDU. EDU had no significant effect on N concentration, N remobilization process, and N harvest index. The findings are helpful to better understand the utilization of N fertilizer by rice under O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and can also provide a theoretical basis for sustainable nutrient management to alleviate the negative impact of O<sub>3</sub> on crop yield and quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
