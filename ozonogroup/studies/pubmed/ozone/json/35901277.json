The rational design and employment of bimetallic nanocatalysts (NCs) are expected to address this issue. In this work, the well-shaped and monodispersed AuPt NCs (diameter \u2248 9 nm) were functionalized on one-dimensional (1D) In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanofibers (NFs) to construct efficient gas sensors. The sensor demonstrated dual-selective and ppb-level detection for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and acetone (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O) at different optimal working temperatures. For the possible application exploitation, a circuit was designed to monitor O<sub>3</sub> concentration and provide warnings when the concentration safety limit (50 ppb) was exceeded. Moreover, simulated exhaled breath measurements were also carried out to diagnose diabetes through C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O concentration. The selective detection for O<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O was further analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The drastically enhanced sensing performances were attributed to the synergistic catalytic effect of AuPt NCs. Both the \"spillover effect\" and the Schottky barrier at the interfaces of AuPt NCs and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NFs promoted the sensing processes of O<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Optoelectronics, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, P.
