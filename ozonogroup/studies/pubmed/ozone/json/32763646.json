During G20, observed concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO were all below national air quality standards, whereas those of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> were above national standard (with an averaged value of 160.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) but had a decreasing trend. Model sensitivity studies show that, MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Hangzhou during G20 were reduced by 11.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> (6.8%), 14.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> (8.9%), and 19.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> (11.7%) with emission control measures in the core area, Zhejiang province, and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, respectively, indicating that control measures were the most effective when carried out jointly in YRD. Considering the ratios of NO<sub>x</sub> to VOCs during G20, Hangzhou and most areas of Zhejiang province were in transitional regime; reductions in either NO<sub>x</sub> or VOCs could reduce O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. We also quantified how sensitive O<sub>3</sub> concentrations respond to emission reductions in sectors of industry, power, residential and transportation in the whole of YRD during G20. The removal of emissions in industry and transportation sectors would lead to the largest reductions of 17.6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> (10.5%) and 12.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> (7.4%) in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Hangzhou during G20, respectively. This study has important implications for the control of high O<sub>3</sub> levels in eastern China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
