Exposure to increased [O(3)] also resulted in warmer canopies, especially during the day. The lower \u03bbET decreased season total evapotranspiration (ET) by c. 26%. The [O(3)]-induced relative decline in ET was half that of the relative decline in seed yield, driving a 50% reduction in seasonal WUE. \u2022 These results suggest that rising [O(3)] will alter the canopy energy fluxes that drive regional climate and hydrology, and have a negative impact on productivity and WUE, key ecosystem services."], "CopyrightInformation": "No claim to original US government works.
