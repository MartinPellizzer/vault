The neutral polymer derived from uridine diphosphate glucose utilization yielded, after cellulase digestion, mostly cellobiose and to a lesser extent a substance tentatively identified as a mixed-linkage beta1,4 = beta1,3-trisaccharide; only cellobiose was found after guanosine diphosphate glucose utilization. The uridine diphosphate glucose utilizing system was inactivated by peroxyacetyl nitrate treatment of intact tissue and to a lesser extent by ozone treatment suggesting that this system is a possible site of interference with cellulose and non-cellulosic glucan biosynthesis in vivo. Direct treatment of the enzyme in vitro by peroxyacetyl nitrate, iodoacetamide or p-chloromercuribenzoate also inactivated the enzyme, indicating that the mechanism of inactivation possibly involves reaction with sulfhydryl groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California 92502."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ordin", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1964 Dec;239:4056-61", "ArticleIdList": ["14247647"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1962 Sep;37(5):603-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16655701"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1967", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1967", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1967", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16656496", "PMC1086512", "10.1104/pp.42.2.205"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
