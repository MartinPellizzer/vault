At ozone dosage of 0.2 g O(3)/g solids, readily biodegradable COD accounted for about 36% of COD from sludge ozonolysate. The denitrification potential of ozonolysate as a carbon source was comparable to that of acetate. Although, the first order constant for phosphorus release with the ozonolysate was half that of acetate, it was much higher than that of wastewater. Continuous operation of the modified IDEA process showed that the removals of nitrogen and phosphorus were simultaneously enhanced by addition of the ozonolysate. Phosphorus release was significantly induced after complete denitrification indicating that phosphorus release was strongly depended on nitrate concentration. Effectiveness of the ozonolysate as a carbon source for EBPR was also confirmed in a track study of the modified IDEA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
