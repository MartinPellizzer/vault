The two reactive dye wastewaters contained high concentrations of NaCl (89-112 g/L) in addition to potentially toxic dye components. To determine the contribution of NaCl to toxicity, simulated dye wastewater samples with and without NaCl were tested. Samples were collected at various times during ozonation (t = 0, 8, 32, 64 min); nematodes were exposed to the samples for 72 h. The influence of ozonation on toxicity varied between dye wastewater types. For the acid-based dye wastewater, toxicity increased as duration of ozonation increased. For the reactive dyes without NaCl, toxicity did not appear to be influenced by ozonation. For the reactive dyes with NaCl, mortality was 100% with or without ozonation. Range-finding experiments with NaCl in water and NaCl in dye wastewaters suggested an additive toxic interaction between NaCl and the dyes in wastewater to the nematodes. The duration of ozonation for acid-based dyes and the relatively high NaCl concentrations for the reactive dyes appear to influence effluent toxicity in the ozonated dye wastewaters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Science, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hitchcock", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Law", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0357245", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4341"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9504973", "10.1007/s002449900315"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
