In the study reported here, we sought to determine whether pregnant rats are more sensitive than age-matched virgin females to the inflammatory effects of ozone, a gaseous oxidant of considerable environmental significance. Rats at several stages of pregnancy and lactation, as well as age-matched virgin females, were exposed to 1 ppm ozone for 6 hr. Controls were sham-exposed to pure air for an identical period of time. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 24 hr after the beginning of exposure, and components of the lavage fluid considered to be indicators of inflammation were used to assess the severity of pulmonary inflammation. The results of this experiment showed that significantly enhanced sensitivity to ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation develops during pregnancy, is maintained during lactation, and disappears following lactation. Implicit in this pattern of differential sensitivity in rats is the possibility of a similar pattern of inflammatory response in analogous groups of humans as well as the potential for applicability to other oxidative pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gunnison", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weideman", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sobo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8200838", "ISSNLinking": "0272-0590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1426719", "10.1016/0272-0590(92)90100-v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
