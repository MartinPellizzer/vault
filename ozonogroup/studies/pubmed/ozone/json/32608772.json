In this study, real-time VOCs were measured continuously by Syntech Spectras GC955 analyzers at the regional background site of the North China Plain from September 1 to 27, 2017. The VOC concentration levels, compositions, spatiotemporal variations, and the ozone formation potential during the observation period were investigated. The potential sources of initial VOCs indicated from the diagnostic ratios were further studied. The averaged total mixing ratio of VOCs was 12.53\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Among all measured VOC species, alkanes were the most abundant species, which accounted for 65.3% of the total concentrations, followed by alkenes (26.7%) and aromatics (6.5%). In addition, the total OH radical loss rate of VOCs (<i>L</i><sup>\u00b7OH</sup>) was 5.2 s<sup>-1</sup>. In particular, the contribution of C4-C5 alkenes to <i>L</i><sup>\u00b7OH</sup> was as high as 61%, followed by C2-C3 alkenes, with a 12.8% contribution of <i>L</i><sup>\u00b7OH</sup>. The average ozone formation potential of VOCs was 36.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. Among all the measured VOC species, alkenes were the most abundant species, which accounted for 71.2%. Among alkenes, the contribution of C4-C5 alkenes was the most prominent. Although the concentration of alkanes in Shangdianzi was much higher than other VOC species, the ozone formation potential was lower. Diagnostic ratios and source implications suggested that Shangdianzi was affected mainly by biomass/biofuel/coal burning, with substantially elevated benzene levels during the observation period, whereas a slight influence of traffic-related emissions was observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Ruo", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Yu-Lu", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Meteorology Forecast Center of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Beijing 100089, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608772", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912032"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
