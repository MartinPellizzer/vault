Patients (n=73) were selected and divided into 2 groups of CHG (n=37) and OZW mouthwash (n=36). Mouthwash was performed by trained nurses. Chi-square test, independent t-test, paired t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Repeated Measure ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of CHG and OZW mouthwash on the risk of VAP occurrence by Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) checklists and swab culture.", "Both CHG and OZW mouthwash reduced the risk of VAP differ at different time points (the first, the third and the fifth days). There was also difference in the incidence of VAP in terms of culture of pulmonary secretions in the 2 groups. Incidence of VAP in the CHG mouthwash group was 45.9%, and also 25% in the OZW mouthwash group. Most pathogens, that found in the culture of pulmonary secretions in the CHG mouthwash was Acinetobacter baumannii; also, in the OZW mouthwash, A baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent ones.", "OZW mouthwash was more effective than CHG mouthwash to reduce the risk of VAP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.
