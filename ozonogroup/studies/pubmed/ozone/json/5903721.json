In addition, this investigation led to the isolation of 8 more (PGs) prostaglandins which were present in higher concentrations than the previously recognized PGs. Samples of human seminal plasma were subjected to silicic acid chromatography, reversed phase partition chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and gas liquid chromatography which isolated those 8 PGs not previously recognized. 4 of these compounds, PGE1-217, PGE2-217, PGE1-278, and PGE2-278 were known from earlier studies but had not been isolated from natural sources. The other 4 were 19 hydroxy derivatives of the 4 abovementioned compounds. The concentrations of the previously recognized PGs were recently determined and it was found that the 19 hydroxy derivatives were present in concentrations 4 times higher than the PGE compounds."]}], "OtherID": ["660826", "00083984"], "PMID": "5903721", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1966", "Month": "04", "Day": "17"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "03", "Day": "06"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0021-9258", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "241", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1966", "Month": "Jan", "Day": "25"}}, "Title": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Biol Chem"}, "ArticleTitle": "Prostaglandins in human seminal plasma.
