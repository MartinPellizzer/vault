Among the fungal diseases, blue mold caused by Penicillium expansum, grey mould caused by Botrytis cinerea, Mucor rot caused by Mucor piriformis are common on pear fruits. Other (weak) pathogens like Phialophora malorum, Alternaria spp., and Cladosporium herbarum tend to infect wounds and senescent fruits. A post-harvest fungicide treatment can reduce decay but effectiveness decreases with the appearance of resistant strains. There is a clear need to develop new and alternative methods of controlling post-harvest diseases. The emerging technologies for the control of post-harvest fungal diseases are essentially threefold: application of antagonistic microorganisms, application of natural antimicrobial substances and application of sanitizing products. Two biological control products, Aspire (Candida oleophila I-182) (Ecogen, Langhorne, PA, USA) and Bio-Save 110 (Pseudomonas syringae) (EcoScience, Worcester, MA, USA; formerly Bio-Save 11) are currently registered in the USA for post-harvest application to pears. Other potential biocontrol agents have been isolated from fruit and shown to suppress post-harvest decay in pear. It is important that evaluation of these microorganisms be carried out in a product formulation because the formulation may improve or diminish antagonistic efficacy depending on the concentration of chemical product and the duration of exposure to the treatment. Plants produce a large number of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial effects on post-harvest pathogens. Detailed studies have been conducted on aromatic compounds, essential oils, volatile substances and isothiocyanates, with encouraging results. In particular, allyl-isothiocyanate used as a volatile substance, controls blue mould in 'Conference' and 'Kaiser' pear inoculated with a thiabendazole-resistant strain. Sanitizing products such as chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid and ozone have considerable fungicidal activity against P. expansum and M. piriformis, depending on the concentration of chemical product and the duration of exposure to the treatment. Sanitizing solutions can be integrated easily with current handling and storage practices; however, further research is required to define the effective procedures better."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CRIOF, University of Bologna, V.
