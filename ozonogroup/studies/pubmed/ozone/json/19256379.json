The results showed that UV/H2O2 could enhance NDMA degradation, but could not control on the formation of DMA. UV/O3 was not only effective for NDMA degradation, but also was good at controlling on DMA formation. Furthermore, factors affecting the formation of DMA during degradation of NDMA by UV/O3 were studied. The formation of DMA decreased with O3 dosage increasing and DMA was 0.98 mg x L(-1) with 7.7 mg x L(-1) NDMA and 6.64 mg x L(-1) O3 dose. Solution pH had obvious effect on controlling of DMA formation during degradation of NDMA by UV/O3 . The formation of DMA lightly increased with pH increasing from acid to neutral but dramatically decreased in basic aqueous solution. The formation of DMA was only 0.3 mg x L(-1) when the initial concentration of NDMA was 7.7 mg x L(-1) under pH = 11.0 condition. UV/O3 had better controlling of DMA formation with lesser initial concentration of NDMA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. xbb_hit@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Bing-bing", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-lin", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-xi", "Initials": "LX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ARQ8157E0Q", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19256379"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
