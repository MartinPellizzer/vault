The trends for daily averages and daily 5th and 95th percentiles were 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0ppb\u00a0decade<sup>-1</sup>, 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0ppb decade<sup>-1</sup> and -0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0ppb decade<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, thus showing a significant increase of background ozone. The surface temperature trends were also explored, obtaining trends of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u2070C decade<sup>-1</sup>, 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u2070C decade<sup>-1</sup> and -0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u2070C decade<sup>-1</sup> for daily averages, 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively. To identify potential changes in the ozone drivers, the weather pattern shifts were analyzed through the horizontal distribution trends of temperature at 2\u00a0m and geopotential height at 850\u00a0hPa. A strengthening of the Azores anticyclone and a regional warming were detected, which could contribute to the ozone trends obtained. The surface ozone trend in every month was explored, identifying a monthly pattern, with remarkable opposite trends in December-January (2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0ppb decade<sup>-1</sup>) vs July-August (-0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0ppb decade<sup>-1</sup>). The surface ozone trends for every hour of the day were also explored, identifying two clear patterns. The first pattern occurred from spring to autumn and was characterized by a behavior opposite to the typical daily ozone cycle. The second pattern was observed in winter, and it shows two relative peaks in the ozone trends (around 13:00 and 19:00 UTC). In a context of ozone precursor's depletion, changes in the weather conditions and warmer climate, to improve our knowledge of the ozone trends, we suggest exploring them based on daily and hourly averages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
