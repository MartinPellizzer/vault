Multiple linear regression with mutual adjustment was used to analyse the associations between exposure to air pollution and health.<b>RESULTS:</b> PEF was significantly associated with ozone for 1-day exposure (\u03b2 = -13.3 l/min, 95% CI -22.7 to -3.8), carbon monoxide for 2-day exposure (\u03b2 = -57.2 l/min, 95% CI -90.7 to -23.7) and particulate matter \u226610 \u03bcm in diameter for 3-day exposure (\u03b2 = -6.0 l/min, 95% CI -9.2 to -2.8) and 7-day exposure (\u03b2 = -8.6 l/min, 95% CI -13.0 to -4.1). Stratified analysis showed that associations between PEF and outdoor air pollutant exposures were similar in students with and without elevated FeNO levels.<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Outdoor air pollution in Malaysia may cause airway obstruction unrelated to eosinophilic airway inflammation among students as measured using FeNO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Universiti Selangor, Shah Alam, International Institute for Global Health, United Nations University-Kuala Lumpur."}], "LastName": "Adman", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Universiti Selangor, Shah Alam, International Institute for Global Health, United Nations University-Kuala Lumpur."}], "LastName": "Hashim", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Health, National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Manaf", "ForeName": "M R A", "Initials": "MRA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Science, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Norback", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Int J Tuberc Lung Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9706389", "ISSNLinking": "1027-3719"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32127103", "10.5588/ijtld.19.0096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
