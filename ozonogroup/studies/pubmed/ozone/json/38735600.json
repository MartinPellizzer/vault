The methodology involved pretreating lignocelluloses with ozone for 20 to 120\u00a0min before dissolving in sodium hydroxide/urea solution. The influence of the pretreatment conditions on cellulose dissolution yield was investigated. Regenerated cellulose films were then formed, with and without the addition of 2\u00a0% chitosan. Mechanical, physical, structural, thermal, and antimicrobial attributes were determined as a function of ozonation conditions of raw materials and chitosan content. The findings exhibited positive effects of short ozonation on enhancing mechanical strength, cohesion, and hydrophobicity. The prolonged ozonation of 120\u00a0min demonstrated optimal improvements in continuity, swelling, and antibacterial resistance of obtained films. Incorporating chitosan enhanced tensile performance, stiffness, and vapor barriers but increased moisture absorption. Tailoring the activation of biomass through ozone pretreatment and chitosan addition resulted in renewable films with adjustable properties to meet diverse packaging requirements, particularly for fruit protective coatings, ensuring the preservation of post-harvest quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
