One hundred and twenty one hour samples were collected in winter 2000. The ambient air was rich in benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylenes (BTEX) and especially toluene (mean: 23.6 microg m(-3), median: 14.66 microg m(-3)), but the presence of chlorinated compounds was also notable. High concentrations of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (mean: 11.4 microg m(-3), max: 90.4 microg m(-3)) were recorded. Multivariate analysis of VOC, trace gases (NO(x), NO(2), NO, SO(2) and O(3)) and meteorological variables (temperature, wind direction and speed, precipitation and radiation) was applied and correlations between VOC were also studied. Principal component analysis and correlation analysis confirm traffic as the main source of VOC in the area, although the importance of evaporative sources is also reflected. Three groups of samples were obtained by cluster analysis; these groups are formed depending on the content of aromatics and ozone and, in many cases, on the sampling hour."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of A Coru\u00f1a, Campus da Zapateira, E-15071 A Coru\u00f1a, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Villarrenaga", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez-Mah\u00eda", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muniategui-Lorenzo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prada-Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tom\u00e0s", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15504503", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.04.037", "S0048-9697(04)00373-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
