Herein, we develop a stretchable triboelectric pressure sensor with a new pattern by superimposing two patterns using both polystyrene beads and UV-ozone treatment. This patterned structure works more sensitively to pressure than a general planar and one-kind patterned structure. The sensor is constructed by sandwiching styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). It demonstrates a high sensitivity of 0.078 kPa<sup>-1</sup> (0-20 kPa), a low detection limit (1.2 kPa), and pressure sensitivity maintained under 40% strain. The detection behavior of the strain-insensitive triboelectric sensor against pressure is very consistent with the simulation based on the theory. In applications, we successfully detect various human motions, not only small motions such as bending fingers but also large motions such as standing up and raising arms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Korea University, Anam-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ho Jung", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Advanced Machinery Design Technology, Korea University, Anam-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Chun", "ForeName": "Kyoung-Yong", "Initials": "KY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Korea University, Anam-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Jun Ho", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1927-9422"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Korea University, Anam-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Advanced Machinery Design Technology, Korea University, Anam-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Chang-Soo", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Sens", "NlmUniqueID": "101669031", "ISSNLinking": "2379-3694"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polystyrenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polystyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wearable Electronic Devices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34100591", "10.1021/acssensors.1c00640"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
