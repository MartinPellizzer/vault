This article presents on the possible impact of liquid ozone, applied for perioperative, on the quality of surgical cement used to fill the marrow cavity in long bones. Material and methods. The research was conducted on fresh on fresh long bone samples from slaughter animals. After routine cleaning of the bone marrow cavity, the marrow channels were filled with surgical cement, using the application methods currently in use in orthopedic surgery, including the vacuum mixing technique to assure high homogeneity of the cement mass. The bone channels of two samples were washed for 5 minutes before application with liquid ozone (ozone content 20 ug/cm3). Another sample, used as a control, was washed out before cement application with only a 0,9% sodium chlorite solution. All there samples were subjected to computer tomography after being filled with cement, using 3-mm slices to assess the quality of filling of the marrow channel. Results. No quality defects were found in the cement filling of marrow channels previously washed with liquid ozone. Conclusion. Liquid ozone, applied as part of the author's ozone-based technique for perioperative antisepsis, has no effect on the quality of cement filling in the bone marrow cavities of long bones. Thus perioperative ozone therapy can be safely applied to prevent infections in the implantation of endoprostheses that require surgical cement for mounting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zak\u0142ad Rehabilitacji, Oddzia\u0142 Fizjoterapii, II Wydzia\u0142 Lekarski, Warszawa; Katedra i Klinika Ortopedii i Traumatologii Narzadu Ruchu, I Wydzia\u0142 Lekarski, Akademia Medyczna, Warszawa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bia\u0142oszewski", "ForeName": "Dariusz", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ortop Traumatol Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "101240146", "ISSNLinking": "1509-3492"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17618196", "490382"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
