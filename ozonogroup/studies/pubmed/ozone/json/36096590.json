In addition, mass concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and CO and meteorological data were synchronously collected. Then, characteristics of total VOCs and major species, the contributions of major VOCs species to ozone formation potential (OFP), and source apportionment of VOCs under the different ozone concentrations were discussed. The mean mixing ratio of VOCs was 53.1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> including aromatics (24.7\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>), alkanes (23.7\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>), alkenes (3.9\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>), and alkynes (0.7\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>). The mean mixing ratios of aromatics, alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes increased approximately 10%, 43%, 38%, and 98% during the period of ozone pollution, respectively, compared with those during the period of non-ozone pollution. Aromatics contributed the most to OFP during the periods of both ozone pollution and non-ozone pollution, followed by alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. Solvent sources, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) leakage, fossil fuel combustion, and hydrocarbon volatilization were resolved using the PMF model, which accounted for 60%\u00b120%, 16%\u00b111%, 15%\u00b111%, and 9%\u00b16% of total VOCs, respectively. During the period of ozone pollution, the contribution of solvent sources to the total VOCs decreased to 44%, whereas that of LPG leakage and hydrocarbon volatilization increased to 21% and 16%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongguan Ecology and Environment Monitoring Station of Guangdong Province, Dongguan 523009, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Lin-Hai", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "LastName": "Fei", "ForeName": "Lei-Lei", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongguan Ecology and Environment Monitoring Station of Guangdong Province, Dongguan 523009, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongguan Ecology and Environment Monitoring Station of Guangdong Province, Dongguan 523009, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Man", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jun-Jun", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Sheng", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University, Guangzhou 511443, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Guangzhou 510655, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkynes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkynes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36096590", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202111285"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
