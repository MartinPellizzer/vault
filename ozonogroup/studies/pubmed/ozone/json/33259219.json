Rate constants for the reaction of OH + NO<sub>2</sub> + M \u2192 products have been measured under conditions relevant to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere with a laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence (LP-LIF) technique augmented by in situ optical spectroscopy for quantification of [NO<sub>2</sub>]. The experiments are carried out over the temperature range of 230-293 K and the pressure range 50-750 Torr of N<sub>2</sub> and air and as a function of [O<sub>2</sub>]. The observed rate coefficients in N<sub>2</sub> agree with the newest experimental literature data sets and are within experimental uncertainty of current recommended literature values at 293 K but are systematically higher by up to 22% at 700 Torr and 230 K. The efficacy of different falloff parametrizations has been examined and compared to those in literature sources. The collisional quenching efficiency of O<sub>2</sub> was found to be in excellent agreement with current literature sources, and rate coefficients determined in air at 293 and 245 K were observed to be within uncertainty of the rate coefficients measured in N<sub>2</sub> bath gas. This work has improved confidence in the literature rate coefficients under conditions of the lower troposphere (\u223c760 Torr, 280-310 K) toward the stratosphere (10-100 Torr, 220-250 K)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2801-5581"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91109, United States."}], "LastName": "Winiberg", "ForeName": "Frank A F", "Initials": "FAF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3149-6611"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91109, United States."}], "LastName": "Zuraski", "ForeName": "Kristen", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SRI International, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yingdi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91109, United States."}], "LastName": "Sander", "ForeName": "Stanley P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2525-160X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91109, United States."}], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33259219", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c08920"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
