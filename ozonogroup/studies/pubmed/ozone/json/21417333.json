We analyzed 68 and 50 alternatives, respectively, for a typical Swiss general and psychiatric hospital to decrease pharmaceutical discharge. Technical alternatives included reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated carbon; organizational alternatives included urine separation. To handle this complex decision, we used Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and combined expert predictions (e.g., costs, pharmaceutical mass flows, ecotoxicological risk, pathogen removal) with subjective preference-valuations from 26 stakeholders (authorities, hospital-internal actors, experts). The general hospital contributed ca. 38% to the total pharmaceutical load at the wastewater treatment plant, the psychiatry contributed 5%. For the general hospital, alternatives removing all pharmaceuticals (especially reverse osmosis, or vacuum-toilets and incineration), performed systematically better than the status quo or urine separation, despite higher costs. They now require closer scrutiny. To remove X-ray contrast agents, introducing roadbags is promising. For the psychiatry with a lower pharmaceutical load, costs were more critical. Stakeholder feedback concerning MCDA was very positive, especially because the results were robust across different stakeholder-types. Our MCDA results provide insight into an important water protection issue: implementing measures to decrease pharmaceuticals will likely meet acceptance. Hospital point-sources merit consideration if the trade-off between costs and pharmaceutical removal is reasonable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag: Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Duebendorf, Switzerland. judit.lienert@eawag.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lienert", "ForeName": "Judit", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koller", "ForeName": "Mirjam", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konrad", "ForeName": "Jonas", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McArdell", "ForeName": "Christa S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schuwirth", "ForeName": "Nele", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decision Making, Organizational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decision Support Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21417333", "10.1021/es1031294"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
