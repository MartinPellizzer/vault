The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of various wastewater disinfection processes on the immune system of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The trout were exposed to a primary-treated effluent for 28 days before and after one of each of the following treatments: ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ozonation and peracetic acid. Immune function was characterized in leucocytes from the anterior head kidney by the following three parameters: phagocytosis activity, natural cytotoxic cells (NCC) function and lymphocyte (B and T) proliferation assays. The results show that the fish mass to length ratio was significantly decreased for the primary-treated and all three disinfection processes. Exposure to the primary-treated effluent led to a significant increase in macrophage-related phagocytosis; the addition of a disinfection step was effective in removing this effect. Both unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation in fish decreased dramatically in fish exposed to the ozonated effluent compared to fish exposed to either the primary-treated effluent or to aquarium water. Stimulation of T lymphocytes proliferation was observed with the peracetic acid treatment group. In conclusion, the disinfection strategy used can modify the immune system in fish at the level of T lymphocyte proliferation but was effective to remove the effects on phagocytosis activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, 531 des Prairies, Laval, Quebec, Canada H7V 1B7."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00e9bert", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gagn\u00e9", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cejka", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouchard", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hausler", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cyr", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blaise", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fournier", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "100959500", "ISSNLinking": "1532-0456"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I6KPI2E1HD", "NameOfSubstance": "Peracetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Oncorhynchus mykiss"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Peracetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quebec"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18538640", "10.1016/j.cbpc.2008.04.007", "S1532-0456(08)00071-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
