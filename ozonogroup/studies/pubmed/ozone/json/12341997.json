The Report points out that environmental survival requires development and development is only possible if the resources of the global environment are conserved. Although the UN and the World Bank must make commitments to development, each nation must devise its own strategy because development is inextricably linked to political, economic, and social factors such as poverty, overpopulation and the status of women. The Report makes 3 specific recommendations: 1) An independent body should be set up to assess global risks; 2) A universal declaration on environment and development should be made and followed by a convention; and 3) The UN General Assembly should set up a UN Program on Sustainable Development. The highest priority should be given to finding alternatives to nuclear energy as well as making the use of nuclear energy safer. Other major environmental problems include desertification, acid rain, the \"greenhouse effect\" and its impact on global climate and sea levels, and the destruction of the ozone layer with concomitant increase in cancer."]}], "OtherID": ["047786", "00179717"], "PMID": "12341997", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "04", "Day": "07"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0251-7329", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "25", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1988", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "UN chronicle", "ISOAbbreviation": "UN Chron"}, "ArticleTitle": "The environment becomes a political issue.
