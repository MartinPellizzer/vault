To achieve the above objective, the diurnal and seasonal mixing ratios of formaldehyde were measured during dry season at two busy roadside locations. The maximal secondary formation fluxes of formaldehyde during summer and winter were found to be 6.63 x 10(7) and 1.23 x 10(7) molecules cm(-3) s(-1), respectively. Apart from formaldehyde (C(1)), several other carbonyls were quantified in this study. An overall good correlation between acetaldehyde (C(2)) and propanal (C(3)) indicates the contribution of vehicular emission to the carbonyl budget. The secondary formaldehyde contributions in summer and winter were about 71% and 32%, respectively. The relative mean contributions of C(1), C(2) and ozone towards generation of OH fluxes in summer were found to be 1.56 x 10(7), 6.96 x 10(5), and 1.29 x 10(7)molecules cm(-3) s(-1), respectively, which were 3.2, 3.4 and 1.6 times higher than those in winter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2010.
