During the heterogeneous ozone reaction, in the presence of 220 ppb SO<sub>2</sub>, an unsaturated aerosol (squalene) undergoes rapid chemical erosion, which is accompanied by NPF. A kinetic model predicts that the mechanism for chemical erosion and NPF originate from a common elementary step (CI + SO<sub>2</sub>) that produces both gas phase SO<sub>3</sub> and small ketones. At low relative humidity (RH = 5%), 20% of the aerosol mass is lost, with 17% of the ozone-surface reactions producing SO<sub>3</sub>. At RH = 60%, the aerosol shrinks by 30%, and the yield of SO<sub>3</sub> is <5%. This multiphase formation mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> by CIs is discussed in the context of indoor air quality and atmospheric chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heine", "ForeName": "Nadja", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arata", "ForeName": "Caleb", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5571-2548"], "LastName": "Houle", "ForeName": "Frances A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0264-0872"], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "Kevin R", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101526034", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7185"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29883127", "10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01171"]}}]}
