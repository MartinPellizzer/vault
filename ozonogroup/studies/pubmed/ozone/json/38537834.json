This study conducted a field campaign from 1 to 8 December 2020 to examine the vertical structure of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration and wind velocity within the boundary layer at two sites (Foshan: FS, Maoming: MM) in Guangdong. Utilising lidar observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), distinct spatial distribution patterns of O<sub>3</sub> over FS and MM influenced by BLJs were identified. The BLJs at both locations exhibited pronounced diurnal variations with a nocturnal maximum exceeding 11\u00a0m/s at a height of approximately 500\u00a0m. The nocturnal enhancement of BLJs resulted from inertial oscillations coupled with diurnal thermal forcing over sloping terrain. A stronger BLJ at FS induced an evident uplift of O<sub>3</sub> and the prevailing northeasterly wind facilitated the transport of O<sub>3</sub> in the nocturnal residual layer from FS to MM. After sunrise, surface heating and the development of the PBL caused the air mass with elevated O<sub>3</sub> levels in the residual layer to descend to ground level. At MM, calm surface winds, a weaker BLJ at 500\u00a0m height, and strong downdrafts collectively contributed to a significant increase in surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration in subsequent days. These findings contribute to our understanding of the interactions between BLJs and variations in surface air pollutant concentrations, thereby providing important insights for future regional emissions control measures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
