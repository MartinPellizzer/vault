The forecast was established to inform the public about the expected amount of erythemally effective UV radiation for the next day. Besides the irradiance, the daily dose is forecasted to enable people to choose the appropriate sun protection tools. Following the UV Index as the measure of global erythemally effective irradiance, the daily dose is expressed in units of UV Index hours. In this study, we have validated the model and the forecast against measurements from broadband UV radiometers of the Robertson-Berger type. The measurements were made at four continents ranging from the northern polar circle (67.4 degrees N) to the Antarctic coast (61.1 degrees S). As additional quality criteria the frequency of underestimation was taken into account because the forecast is a tool of radiation protection and made to avoid overexposure. A value closer than one minimal erythemal dose for the most sensitive skin type 1 to the observed value was counted as hit and greater deviations as underestimation or overestimation. The Austrian forecast model underestimates the daily dose in 3.7% of all cases, whereas 1.7% results from the model and 2.0% from the assumed total ozone content. The hit rate could be found in the order of 40%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Physics and Biostatistics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinaerplatz 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria. alois.schmalwieser@vu-wien.ac.at"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmalwieser", "ForeName": "Alois W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schauberger", "ForeName": "G\u00fcnther", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janouch", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nunez", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koskela", "ForeName": "Tapani", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berger", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karamanian", "ForeName": "Gabriel", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15453822", "10.1562/2003-12-03-RA-019", "2003-12-03-RA-019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
