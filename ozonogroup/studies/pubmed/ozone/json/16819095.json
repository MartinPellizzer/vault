As an inhaled toxicant, ozone induces its adverse effects mainly on the lung. Inhalation of particulate matter has been reported to cause airway inflammation in humans and animals. Furthermore, epidemiological evidence has indicated that exposure to particulate matter (PM[2.5-10]), including diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has been correlated with increased acute and chronic respiratory morbidity and exacerbation of asthma. Previously, exposure to ozone or particulate matter and their effect on the lung have been addressed as separate environmental problems. Ozone and particulate matter may be chemically coupled in the ambient air. In the present study we determined whether ozone exposure enhances DEP effect on interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression in human airway epithelial cells. We report that ozone exposure (0.5 ppm x 1 hr) significantly increased DEP-induced IL-8 gene expression in A549 cells (117 +/- 19 pg/ml, n = 6, p < 0.05) as compared to cultures treated with DEP (100 microg/ml x 4 hr) alone (31 +/- 3 pg/ml, n = 6), or cultures exposed to purified air (24 +/- 6 pg/ml, n = 6). The increased DEP-induced IL-8 gene expression following ozone exposure was attributed to ozone-induced increase in the activity of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and NF-IL6. The results of the present study indicate that ozone exposure enhances the toxicity of DEP in human airway epithelial cells by augmenting IL-8 gene expression, a potent chemoattractant of neutrophils in the lung."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Environmental Health and Molecular Toxicology Laboratory, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39217, USA. ramzi.m.kafoury@jsums.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kafoury", "ForeName": "Ramzi M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelley", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "G12RR13459", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "101238455", "ISSNLinking": "1660-4601"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16819095", "10.3390/ijerph2005030004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
