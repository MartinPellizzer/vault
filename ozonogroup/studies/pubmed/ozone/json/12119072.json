The trachea with two main bronchi was removed from each animal after O3 exposure. The trachea lavage fluid was used to measure the protein content as an index of altered tracheobronchial epithelial (TE) cell membrane permeability after O3 exposure. The TE cells were isolated and employed for the determination of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) by fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU). The statistical significance level was set at alpha =.05. The results show that neither the yield nor the viability of the TE cell from various O3 treatment groups was different from that of controls. Compared to controls, the protein content was elevated significantly after 0.45 ppm O3 exposure; however, the amount of DNA SSBs was not. The number of DNA SSBs increased significantly in the 1.00 ppm O3 exposure group when compared to controls. Regardless of the alkali incubation time at 15 degrees C, the double-stranded DNA left in the alkali TE cell lysate was a linear function of O3 exposure concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Safety, School of Health and Human Performance, Indiana State University, Terre Haute, Indiana 47809, USA. s-ferng@indstate.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferng", "ForeName": "Shiaw-Fen", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Single-Stranded"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Single-Stranded"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12119072", "10.1080/08958370290084539"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
