Current experimental evidence focus principally on the pathogenic effect of exposure to a single air pollutant, ignoring the possible synergistic effect of combined exposure to a mix of these pollutants, which is a more realistic scenario. In this study, allergic mice and a nociceptor antagonist were used to explore the mechanisms of co-exposure to these two important air pollutants. Compared with exposure to either PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>, combined exposure to both greatly aggravated allergic asthma in a dose dependent manner, including increased airway hyperresponsiveness, goblet cell metaplasia, more severe airway inflammation and higher oxidative stress levels. In addition, co-exposure in the allergic mice resulted in elevation of the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and of the production of substance P (SP), which exacerbated lung inflammation by neurogenic inflammation. TRPV1 antagonist (capsazepine, CPZ) treatment for the co-exposed allergic mice, markedly attenuated TRPV1 expression and SP release, and reduced airway inflammation and oxidative damage, further alleviating airway hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that neuro-immune interactions might be involved in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> co-exposure aggravated allergic asthma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
