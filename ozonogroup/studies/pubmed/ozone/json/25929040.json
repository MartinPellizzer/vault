In addition, source apportionment was simultaneously evaluated. The results showed that the annual average concentrations of OC and EC in PM1.1 were 10. 10 \u03bcg x m(-3) and 2.52 \u03bcg x m(-3) in NS area, and 11.22 \u03bcg x m(-3) and 3.12 \u03bcg x m(-3) in NH area, respectively. This result indicated that OC and EC pollution in NH was more serious than that in NS area. Meanwhile, the concentrations of OC and EC in winter and spring were obviously higher compared to those in summer in these two sampling sites, which was mainly ascribed to the increased coal combustion and the unfavorable emission condition of air pollutants in summer and spring. We noted that the SOC/TOC value was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. In addition, the SOC concentration was observed to show a positive correlation with ozone concentrations, which indicated that the photochemical reaction was a main way of SOC formation in autumn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wen-juan", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Zhao-bing", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Feng-ling", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rui", "ForeName": "Mao-ling", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Zi-yan", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25929040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
