Bench-scale investigations revealed that ICM can be partly oxidized during ozonation processes, whereas the ionic diatrizoic acid showed the lowest reactivity. Iomeprol, as a representative of ICM, was not fully mineralized during ozonation. Thus, unknown oxidation by-products were formed. Aqueous solutions of iomeprol were treated by ozonation in order to assess the formation of oxidation by-products. The by-products were characterized by different liquid chromatography methods including detection of single-stage mass spectra, product ion mass spectra, and induced in-source fragmentation for analysis of iodine containing oxidation by-products. Aldehyde and carbonyl containing compounds were proposed to be among the stable by-products. A derivatization step confirms that the aldehyde and carbonyl moieties are major functional groups in oxidation by-products of iomeprol. Furthermore, oxidation by-products of iomeprol were detected at the outlet of an ozone reactor at a full-scale waterworks. However, the toxicological relevance of the by-products is a major future research tasks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zweckverband Landeswasserversorgung, Betriebs- und Forschungslaboratorium, Am Spitzigen Berg 1, D-89129 Langenau, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seitz", "ForeName": "Wolfram", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jia-Qian", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "Walter H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maier", "ForeName": "Dietrich", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maier", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contrast Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17E17JBP8L", "NameOfSubstance": "iomeprol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9679TC07X4", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JR13W81H44", "NameOfSubstance": "Iopamidol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Contrast Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iopamidol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17892892", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.07.081", "S0045-6535(07)00983-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
