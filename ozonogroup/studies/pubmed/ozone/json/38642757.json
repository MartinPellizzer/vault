The subsequent implementation of these measures has led to remarkable enhancements in air quality. This study aims to enhance our understanding of the long-term trends in fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and gaseous pollutants of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) across China from 2000 to 2020. Utilizing the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we conducted a nationwide analysis of air quality, systematically quantifying model predictions against observations for pollutants. The CMAQ model effectively captured the trends of air pollutants, meeting recommended performance benchmarks. The findings reveal variations in pollutant concentrations, with initial increases in PM<sub>2.5</sub> followed by a decline after 2013. The proportion of the population living in high PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (>75\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) decreased to <5\u00a0% after 2015. However, during the period from 2017 to 2020, around 40\u00a0% of the population continued to live in regions that did not meet the criteria for Chinese air quality standards (35\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). From 2000 to 2019, fewer than 20\u00a0% of the population met the WHO standard (100\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>. In 2000, 77\u00a0% of the population met the NO<sub>2</sub> standard (<20\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), a figure that declined to 60\u00a0% between 2005 and 2014, nearly reaching 70\u00a0% in 2020. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of the changes in pollutants and public exposure in 2000-2020.
