However, the influences of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment on the biomass, diversity, composition, and functioning of the soil bacterial community remain unclear. We investigated the effects of short-term factorial combinations of CO<sub>2</sub> (by 200\u00a0ppm) and O<sub>3</sub> (by 40\u00a0ppb) enrichment on the dynamics of soil bacterial community in paddy soils with two rice varieties (Japonica, Nangeng 5055 (NG5055) vs. Wuyujing 3 (WYJ3)) in an open top chamber facility. When averaged both varieties, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment showed no individual or combined effect on the abundance or diversity of soil bacterial community. Similarly, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment did not exert any significant effect on the relative abundance of bacterial phyla. However, O<sub>3</sub> enrichment significantly reduced the relative abundance of Myxococcota phylum by a mean of 37.5%, which negatively correlated to root N content. Compared to ambient conditions, soil bacterial community composition was separated by CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in NG5055, and by both CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment in WYJ3, with root N content identified as the most influential factor. These results indicated that root N was the top direct predictor for the community composition of soil bacteria. The COG (cluster of orthologous groups) protein of cell motility was significantly reduced by 5.8% under CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, and the COG protein of cytoskeleton was significantly decreased by 14.7% under O<sub>3</sub> enrichment. Furthermore, the co-occurrence network analysis indicated that both CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment decreased the network complexity of the soil bacterial community. Overall, our results highlight that continuous CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> enrichment would potentially damage the health of paddy soils through adverse impacts on the associations and functional composition of soil microbial communities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
