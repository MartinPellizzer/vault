Interestingly, in this study, the effluent was totally limpid and iron sludge did not generate when dissolved silicate (Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>) was used as the electrolyte in an electrolysis catalyzed ozone (ECO-Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>) system. More importantly, the pseudo-first-order rate constants (0.112\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>) for DMAC degradation in ECO-Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> process was much higher than those of ECO systems using other electrolytes. An inhibition film formed on the iron electrode surface was identified to inhibit excess corrosion of iron electrodes and efficiently catalyze decomposition of ozone simultaneously. It was confirmed that hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) played a dominant role for the degradation of DMAC, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were also contained in ECO-Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> system. The contributions of contained oxidative reactions in ECO-Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> system were quantitatively evaluated. Finally, the degradation pathway of DMAC was proposed. This work provides an effective way for protecting electrode from corrosion in electrochemical process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
