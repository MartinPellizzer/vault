Raw leachate was initially coagulated by ferric chloride (FeCl3) at the experimental-determined optimal dosage of 900 mgl(-1), and the ozone-based AOPs were subsequently applied. Results indicate that all AOPs would result in a significant increase on the ratio of BOD5/COD from 0.06 to 0.5 at the applied ozone dosage of 1.2 gl(-1). The increase on biodegradability for ozonated leachate indicates that these AOPs would be beneficial to the subsequent biological treatment process. To better explain the alteration of high organic molecules after oxidation, ultrafiltration was used to separate the leachate by several molecular weight cutoffs (MWCO). The COD distribution for coagulated leachate is 34% for MWCO>10 kDa, 7% for MWCO between 5 and 10 kDa, 22% for MWCO between 1 and 5 kDa, and 37% for MWCO<1 kDa. Following ozonation or AOPs, the predominant distribution of COD would be obviously shifted to the MWCO less than 1000 gmol(-1) (72-85%) over the other MWCO ranges. In addition, Gel Permeation Chromatograph (GPC) analysis has showed a substantial agreement on the cleavage of larger organic compounds into smaller ones. O3/UV was found to be the most effective approach among these ozone-based AOPs to enhancing the biodegradability and eliminating the color of leachate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Science, Feng Chia University, Taichung 407, Taiwan. jjwu@fcu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jerry J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chih-Chao", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hong-Wen", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chia-Chi", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U38V3ZVV3V", "NameOfSubstance": "ferric chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferric Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14637357", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2003.10.006", "S0045-6535(03)00994-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
