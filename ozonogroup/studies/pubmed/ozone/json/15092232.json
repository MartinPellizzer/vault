One-half of the plots were given a periodic soil drench of an antioxidant (EDU) which has the capacity to protect foliage against ozone toxicity. Based upon visible foliar injury and total tuber yield, the cultivars Norland and Norchip proved significantly more sensitive to ambient ozone pollution than Green Mountain, Irish Cobbler, Belrus or Superior. When foliar injury was less than 20%, no impact on tuber yield was detected. However, when 75% of the foliage exhibited O(3) toxicity symptoms, tuber yield was reduced 25% and 31%, respectively, in 'Norland' and 'Norchip'. A review of results from studies in the US and Canada utilizing different assessment methodologies provides evidence that ambient ozone causes significant tuber yield reduction in sensitive white potato genotypes when foliar injury exceeds 20 to 40%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Cook College, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clarke", "ForeName": "B B", "Initials": "BB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greenhalgh-Weidman", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brennan", "ForeName": "E G", "Initials": "EG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092232", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90150-b", "026974919090150B"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
