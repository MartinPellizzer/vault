It is prone to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, such as ozone, leading to the formation of oxyphytosterols. A better understanding regarding the biological effects and mechanism of action of oxyphytosterols is required since the beneficial and adverse side effects of these compounds on human health remain highly controversial. In this work, we investigated the biological effects of \u03b2-Secosterol (\u03b2Sec), a new oxyphytosterol generated by the reaction of \u03b2Sito with ozone. Treatment of HepG2 cells with \u03b2Sito or \u03b2Sec (0.1-100\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h induced a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability in the MTT assay, with \u03b2Sec showing higher efficacy than \u03b2Sito. However, \u03b2Sec presented a lower potency than \u03b2Sito, showing IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a037.32\u00a0\u03bcM, higher than \u03b2Sito (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.23\u00a0\u03bcM) at 48\u00a0h. Cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry showed a slight decrease of G0/G1 phase with \u03b2Sito 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM, but a significant cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the treatment for 48\u00a0h with \u03b2Sec 20 \u03bcM (62.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.15%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and \u03b2Sec 40 \u03bcM (66.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.39%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) when compared to control (56.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.60%). No suggestion of apoptosis was indicated by flow cytometry data. Also, \u03b2Sec (20 and 40\u00a0\u03bcM) reduced the mitotic index. In the laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis no alterations in cell morphology were observed with \u03b2Sito (0.5\u00a0\u03bcM). Nevertheless, round-shaped cells, abnormal nuclear morphology with shrinkage, and formation of microtubules clusters were observed in the treatment with \u03b2Sec, indicating a disruption in the microtubules network organization. N-acetyl-l-cysteine was not able to inhibit any of these cellular effects, indicating a lack of involvement of oxidative stress in the mechanism of action of \u03b2Sec. Although not further investigated in this study, it was discussed the hypothesis that covalent adduct formation with lysine residues of proteins, could play an important role in the biological effects elicited by \u03b2Sec. Elucidation of the primary cellular processes induced by \u03b2Sec provides the essential knowledge to be aware of its potential adverse side effects or therapeutic use of this oxyphytosterol."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
