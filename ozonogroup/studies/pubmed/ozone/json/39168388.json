The adsorption reached equilibrium after 3 h, resulting in a decrease in the COD concentration from 98.9 mg L<sup>-1</sup> in BTPW to 42.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup> when utilizing a PAC dosage of 5 g L<sup>-1</sup>. The dominant fractions of dissolved organic matter in BTPW were hydrophilic acids (HIA), hydrophilic neutrals (HIN), and hydrophobic acids (HOA), accounting for 48.8%, 34.2%, and 17.0% of the total dissolved organic carbon, respectively. Three fractions were all predominantly composed of humic/fulvic acid-like substances, while the HOA fraction exhibited highest susceptibility to adsorption by PAC, followed by the HIA and HIN fractions. FT-ICR MS data revealed PAC preferentially adsorbed the unsaturated and oxygen-rich substances containing more carboxyl groups. Additionally, the spent PAC was regenerated through ozonation and subsequently utilized in the adsorption cycles. The regeneration was successfully conducted under an ozone concentration of 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for a duration of 10 min, and the regeneration efficiency remained about 87.0% even after undergoing five-cycle of adsorption-regeneration. The findings of this study demonstrate that PAC adsorption is a viable and efficacious treatment technology for efficiently removing refractory COD from BTPW."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
