Days with smoke have an average of 11 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> more PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 8 ppb higher maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations than nonsmoke days, and they also account for 94% of all days that exceed the daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> health standard (35 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>) and 36% of all days that exceed the O<sub>3</sub> health standard (70 ppb). To estimate the smoke contributions to the O<sub>3</sub> MDA8, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were built for each site using the nonsmoke day data and up to 8 predictors. The mean and standard deviation of the residuals from the GAMs were 0 \u00b1 6.1 ppb for the nonsmoke day data and 4.3 \u00b1 7.9 ppb for the smoke day data, indicating a significant enhancement in the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> on smoke days. We found positive residuals on 72% of the smoke days and for these days, we calculate an average smoke contribution to the O<sub>3</sub> MDA8 of 7.8 \u00b1 6.0 ppb. Over the 6 year period, the percentage of exceedance days due to smoke in the continental US was 25% of all exceedance days, and the highest was in 2023 (38%). In 2023, the Central US experienced an unusually high number of exceedance days, 1522, with 52% of these impacted by smoke, while the Eastern US had fewer exceedance days, 288, with 78% of these impacted by smoke. Our results demonstrate the importance of wildland fires as contributors to exceedances of the health-based national air quality standards for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, University of Washington, Bothell, Washington 98011, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0009-0001-2045-8532"], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Haebum", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, University of Washington, Bothell, Washington 98011, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1965-9051"], "LastName": "Jaffe", "ForeName": "Daniel A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39120533", "10.1021/acs.est.4c05870"]}}]}
