Currently, the synergy of AOPs has raised lively interest in water and wastewater treatment. Here the sandwiched catalyst of MnO<sub>2</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>/GO/p-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (MN/GO/CN) is synthesized, in which graphene oxide (GO) acts as \"core layer\" connecting aminated MnO<sub>2</sub> (MnO<sub>2</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>) for catalytic ozonation and proton-functionalized g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (p-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) for photocatalysis. The MN/GO/CN combines the AOPs of catalytic ozonation and photocatalysis, initiates hydroxyl radicals 4.2 times the sum of catalytic ozonation and photocatalysis, and achieves the first order kinetics constant of 2.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup>/s, which is 2.7, 8.1 and 20.1 times that of catalytic ozonation, photo ozonation, and photocatalysis, respectively, and consequently reduces CLX from 1.0\u00a0mg/L to below the detection limit within 2.5\u00a0min, demonstrating the strong synergism between the AOPs. The sandwich structure enables GO to mediate the electron transfer between p-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>, which not only hinders electron-hole recombination on p-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, but also speeds redox electron cycle on MnO<sub>2</sub> to promote the catalytic activity. The simultaneous catalytic ozonation and photocatalysis by sandwiched bifunctional catalyst to obtain synergistic effect will find its broad prospect in water and wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
