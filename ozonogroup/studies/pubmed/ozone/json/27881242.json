Its photolysis has been studied under sunlight conditions and its reaction rate constant with OH radicals was measured by the relative rate method. The reaction with ozone was also investigated. The tropospheric degradation of pirimiphos-methyl is controlled mainly by the OH radical reaction. The rate coefficient of the OH reaction with pirimiphos-methyl, k, was measured by a conventional relative rate technique, where aniline was taken as a reference. The resulting value of the OH reaction rate constant with pirimiphos-methyl was k=(1.14\u00b10.2)\u00d710<sup>-10</sup>cm<sup>3</sup>molecule<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. The tropospheric lifetime of pirimiphos-methyl with respect to the reaction with OH radicals was estimated to be around 1.6h (283\u00b110) K and atmospheric pressure. Significant aerosol formation was observed in the OH reaction with yields that ranged from 25 to 37%, and with particle diameters below 550nm. This therefore reveals a high human risk due to PM<1, without taking into account the chemical composition of the degradation products. SO<sub>2</sub>, glyoxal and other oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds were the main degradation products detected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
