The present work investigates the use of novel treatment approach of ultrasound (US) combined with advanced oxidation techniques for the degradation of potassium ferrocyanide (KFC) for the first time. An ultrasonic bath equipped with longitudinal horn (1kW rated power and 25kHz frequency) has been used. The effect of initial pH (2-9) on the progress of degradation has been investigated initially and subsequently using the optimized pH, effect of addition of hydrogen peroxide (ratio of KFC:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> varied over the range of 1:0.5-1:5) and TiO<sub>2</sub> in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1:1 ratio by weight of TiO<sub>2</sub>) as process intensifying approach has been studied. Combination of ultrasonic irradiation with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) (100-400mg/h) and ultraviolet irradiation (UV) has also been investigated. Use of combination of US with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+TiO<sub>2</sub> and ozone resulted in extent of KFC degradation as 54.2%, 74.82% and 82.41% respectively. Combination of US with both UV and ozone was established to be the best approach yielding 92.47% degradation. The study also focused on establishing kinetic rate constants for all the treatment approaches which revealed that all the approaches followed first order kinetic mechanism with higher rate constants for the combination approaches. Overall, it has been conclusively established that ultrasound based combined treatment schemes are very effective for the treatment of KFC containing wastewaters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
