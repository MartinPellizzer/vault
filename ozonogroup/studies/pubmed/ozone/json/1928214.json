Acute (2 hours) exposure to 1.0 ppm of ozone showed an effect on tracheal mucous velocity that resulted in a significant decrease 40 minutes and 2 hours after exposure (35% and 40% of the baseline, respectively). Repeated exposure for longer periods (4 days, 5 hours/day) to 1.0 ppm of ozone also significantly decreased tracheal mucous velocity during the first and the second day (-47% and -70% of the baseline, respectively), but during the following days of exposure adaptation took place (tracheal mucous velocity ranging from -42% to -55% of baseline). The tracheal mucous velocity still significantly decreased 5 days after the last exposure. N-Acetylcysteine, known both for its mucolytic and antioxidizing properties, has been demonstrated to prevent significantly all of the immediate effects of either short-term or long-term ozone exposures on mucociliary functions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Policlinico, Milano, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allegra", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moavero", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rampoldi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0267200", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9343"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mucociliary Clearance"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1928214", "10.1016/0002-9343(91)90286-7", "0002-9343(91)90286-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
