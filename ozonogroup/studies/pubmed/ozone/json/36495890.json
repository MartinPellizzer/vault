This study aims to estimate trends in ozone concentrations and attributable mortality for urban-rural catchment areas worldwide.", "In this modelling study, we used a health impact function to estimate ozone concentrations and ozone-attributable chronic respiratory disease mortality for urban areas worldwide, and their surrounding peri-urban, peri-rural, and rural areas. We estimated ozone-attributable respiratory health outcomes using a modified Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2019 Study approach. We evaluate long-term trends with linear regressions of annual ozone concentrations and ozone-attributable mortality against time in years, and examined the influence of each health impact function input parameter to temporal changes in ozone-attributable disease burden estimates for 12\u2008946 cities worldwide by region, from 2000 to 2019.", "Ozone-attributable mortality worldwide increased by 46% from 2000 (290\u2008400 deaths [95% CI 151\u2008800-457\u2008600]) to 2019 (423\u2008100 deaths [95% CI 223\u2008200-659\u2008400]). The fraction of global ozone-attributable mortality occurring in peri-urban areas remained unchanged from 2000 to 2019 (56%), whereas urban areas gained in their share of global ozone-attributable burden (from 35% to 37%; 54\u2008000 more deaths). Across all cities studied, average population-weighted mean ozone concentration increased by 11% (46 parts per billion [ppb] to 51 ppb). The number of cities with concentrations above the WHO peak season ozone standard (60 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) increased from 11\u2008568 (89%) of 12\u2008946 cities in 2000 to 12\u2008433 (96%) cities in 2019. Percent change in ozone-attributable mortality averaged across 11\u2008032 cities within each region from 2000 to 2019 ranged from -62% in eastern Europe to 350% in tropical Latin America. The contribution of ozone concentrations, population size, and baseline chronic respiratory disease rates to the change in ozone-attributable mortality differed regionally.", "Ozone exposure is increasing worldwide, contributing to disproportionate ozone mortality in peri-urban areas and increasing ozone exposure and attributable mortality in urban areas worldwide. Reducing ozone precursor emissions in areas affecting urban and peri-urban exposure can yield substantial public health benefits.", "NASA Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the NOAA Co-operative Agreement with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
