This study was conducted to evaluate a method for quantifying the effects of performing spirometry from a reduced inspiratory position on measures of airway obstruction, and to apply the method to published ozone-response data. Nineteen healthy, nonsmoking adults, 18-30 yr of age, each performed 17 forced expiratory maneuvers from inspiratory volumes that ranged from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity. In general, measures of airway obstruction were related strongly to total expired volume, and approximately 80% of the ozone-induced decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) resulted from the reduction in forced vital capacity. Results indicated that, for young, healthy, nonsmoking adults, spirometric values from maneuvers conducted from reduced inspiratory positions can be predicted accurately and precisely in the unexposed state, allowing interpretation of measures of ozone-induced airway obstruction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Human Studies Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.
