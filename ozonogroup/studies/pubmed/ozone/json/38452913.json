Spatiotemporal land-use random-forest models at 1\u00a0km spatial resolution assigned to the maternal residential addresses were used to estimate the exposure to particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).", "For PM<sub>2.5,</sub> PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, there was suggestive evidence of increased risk of preeclampsia (PE, n\u00a0=\u00a0442), but no evidence of increased risk for all subtypes of HDP (n\u00a0=\u00a02297) and gestational hypertension (GH, n\u00a0=\u00a01901). For instance, an interquartile range of 7.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 0.81, 1.39) and 1.04 (0.92, 1.17) after adjustment for NO<sub>2</sub> and the corresponding results for a 15.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>2</sub> after adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub> were 1.11 (0.92, 1.34) for PE and 0.83 (0.76, 0.90) for HDP. Increased risks for HDP and GH were suggested for O<sub>3</sub> in single-pollutant models and for PM after adjustment for NO<sub>2</sub>, but all other associations were stable or attenuated in two-pollutant models.", "The results of our study suggest that PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> increases the risk of PE and that these effects are robust to adjustment for O<sub>3</sub> while the increased risks for GH and HDP suggested for O<sub>3</sub> attenuated after adjustment for PM or NO<sub>2</sub>.
