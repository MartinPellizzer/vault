Using a meta-analysis, the effects of greenhouse gases, weather-related stresses projected to intensify due to climate change, and management practices including inputs, shading, and intercropping on \u03b5c were statistically quantified from 140 published studies to identify where improvements would have the largest impact on closing yield gaps. Variation in the response of \u03b5c to treatment type and dosage, plant characteristics, and growth conditions were also examined. Significant mean increases in \u03b5c were caused by elevated [CO2] (20%), shade (18%), and intercropping (15%). \u03b5c increased curvilinearly up to 55% with nitrogen additions whereas phosphorus application was most beneficial at low levels. Significant decreases in \u03b5c of -8.4% due to elevated [O3], -16.8% due to water stress, and -6.5% due to foliar damage were found. A non-significant decrease in \u03b5c of -17.3% was caused by temperature stress. These results identify the need to engineer greater stress tolerance and enhanced responses to positive factors such as [CO2] and nitrogen to improve average yields and yield potential. Optimizing management strategies will also enhance the benefits possible with intercropping, shade, and pest resilience. To determine optimal practices for \u03b5c improvement, further studies should be conducted in the field since several responses were exaggerated by non-field experimental conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, 1206 West Gregory Drive, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slattery", "ForeName": "Rebecca A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ainsworth", "ForeName": "Elizabeth A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ort", "ForeName": "Donald R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Adams DC, Gurevitch J, Rosenberg MS. 1997.
