The performance of pretreatments on mitigating membrane fouling caused by Songhua River water (SHR) was evaluated by specific flux, membrane fouling resistance distribution, and membrane fouling index. Moreover, the degradation of natural organic matter in SHR was investigated by UV absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UV<sub>254</sub>), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and fluorescent organic matter. Results showed that the 100PAC-5O<sub>3</sub> process was the most effective in improving the specific flux, with 82.89\u00a0% and 58.17\u00a0% reductions in the reversible fouling resistance and irreversible fouling resistance respectively. Additionally, the irreversible membrane fouling index was reduced by 20\u00a0% relative to 5O<sub>3</sub>-100PAC. The PAC-O<sub>3</sub> process also exhibited superior performance in the degradation of UV<sub>254</sub>, DOC, three fluorescent components, and three micropollutants in the SHR system compared to O<sub>3</sub>-PAC pretreatment. The O<sub>3</sub> stage played a major role in mitigating membrane fouling, while PAC pretreatment enhanced the oxidation in the subsequent O<sub>3</sub> stage during the PAC-O<sub>3</sub> process. Furthermore, the Extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory and pore blocking-cake layer filtration model fitting analysis were employed to explain the mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation and fouling patterns transformation. It was found that PAC-O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased the repulsive interactions between the foulants and the membrane, which restrained the formation of the cake layer filtration stage. Overall, this study evidenced the potential of PAC-O<sub>3</sub> pretreatment in surface water treatment applications, providing new insights into the mechanism of controlling membrane fouling and improving the permeate quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
