Recent studies demonstrated the potential antimicrobial effects of atmospheric cold plasma treatment on various food surfaces including RTE meat products. However, the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, determining the efficacy of cold plasma to reduce Listeria has not been reported. This study investigated the influence of rosemary extract, salt (% NaCl), and treatment temperature on the efficacy of plasma to reduce numbers of L. innocua on RTE ham. The effect of post-treatment storage on L. innocua inactivation was also investigated. When the cold plasma treatment temperature was 4\u202f\u00b0C, we observed a significant reduction in L. innocua of 1.75 and 1.51 log CFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on 1% and 3% NaCl ham surface without rosemary extract respectively, after 180\u202fs treatment. At a treatment temperature of 23\u202f\u00b0C, the L. innocua cells were reduced by 1.78 and 1.43 log CFU/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively on these surfaces after 180\u202fs. No significant effects of salt concentration and treatment temperature were observed on L. innocua inactivation during cold plasma treatment of ham. The post treatment storage at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 6\u202fh after 180\u202fs of plasma treatment enhanced further reduction of L. innocua on 1% NaCl ham without rosemary. We also observed the increased concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalent lipid oxidation of plasma treated samples and was significantly higher (1.53 MDA mg/ kg ham) compared to untreated samples (0.92 MDA mg/kg ham). However, no significant differences in surface color parameters, L* and b* values were observed after plasma treatment, except a significant increase in a* values. The water content of plasma exposed samples decreased significantly for all treatment conditions whereas the water activity values were not changed significantly. In conclusion, the atmospheric cold plasma could be applied as a means for surface decontamination of RTE ham. However, the drying and oxidation of ham should be controlled in an open atmospheric plasma treatment condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
