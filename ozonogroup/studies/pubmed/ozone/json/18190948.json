The ozonation and catalytic ozonation with synthetic goethite (FeOOH) and cerium dioxide (CeO(2)) were carried out under normal conditions, i.e. pH 7, reaction time of 10 min, and ozone/DOC ratio of about 1. The fluorescence spectra were recorded at both excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and synchronous scanning modes. EEM results reveal that ozonation of these DOM fractions causes a significant decrease of the aromaticity of humic-like structures and an increase of electron withdrawing groups, e.g., carboxylic groups. The catalysts can further improve the destruction of the humic-like structures in catalytic ozonation. Synchronous spectra reveal that ozonation of hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic acid (HIA) yields a significant amount of by-products with low aromaticity and low molecular weight. Catalytic ozonation enhances substantially the formation of these by-products from HIA and improves the destruction of highly polycyclic aromatic structures for all examined DOM fractions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jinfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiang", "ForeName": "Zhimin", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18190948", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.11.030", "S0045-6535(07)01375-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
