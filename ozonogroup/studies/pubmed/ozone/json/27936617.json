However, despite the constantly growing knowledge of ozonation over the past few years, the characterization of transformation products (TPs) is still a major concern, particularly because such TPs might remain biologically active. It has been shown for selected tertiary amine pharmaceuticals that they react with ozone and form the corresponding N-oxides. This study therefore applies liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to assess the overall N-oxide formation during the pilot-scale ozonation of a secondary wastewater effluent from a major city in Germany. Sample analysis by LC-HRMS revealed the occurrence of 1,229 compounds, among which 853 were precursors attenuated by ozone and 165 were TPs. Further examination of precursors and TPs using Kendrick mass and Kendrick mass defect analysis revealed 34 pairs of precursors and products corresponding to a mono-oxygenation. Among these, 27 pairs (16% of all TPs) were consistent with N-oxides since the TP had a higher retention time than the precursor, a characteristic of these compounds. Using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, 10 of these N-oxides could be identified and were shown to be stable during a subsequent filtration step."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Analytical Chemistry, Center for Applied Geosciences, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen , H\u00f6lderlinstra\u00dfe 12, 72074 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Merel", "ForeName": "Sylvain", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Analytical Chemistry, Center for Applied Geosciences, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen , H\u00f6lderlinstra\u00dfe 12, 72074 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Lege", "ForeName": "Sascha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Analytical Chemistry, Center for Applied Geosciences, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen , H\u00f6lderlinstra\u00dfe 12, 72074 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Yanez Heras", "ForeName": "Jorge E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6682-5828"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Analytical Chemistry, Center for Applied Geosciences, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen , H\u00f6lderlinstra\u00dfe 12, 72074 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Zwiener", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27936617", "10.1021/acs.est.6b02373"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
