Herein, the effect of a robust and easy-recovery catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiC, for the catalytic ozonation of hardly biodegradable COD (hard COD) in coking wastewater had been explored. Al-O-Si bond formed on modified SiC through the substitution of hydrogen in surficial Si-OH groups by Al<sup>3+</sup>. The Lewis acid sites improved the adsorption of ozone and facilitated the formation of \u00b7OH and O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup>. For coking wastewater treatment, the removal ratio of hard COD and the generation speed of hydroxyl radical (R<sub>ct</sub>) in the catalytic ozonation process were 71% and 253% higher than those in the ozonation group, respectively. Ozone utilization increased from 0.44\u00a0g COD removed/g O<sub>3</sub> in the ozonation group to 1.42\u00a0g COD removed/g O<sub>3</sub> in the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiC catalytic ozonation group. In a full-scale application, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiC catalytic ozonation decreased the consumption of O<sub>3</sub> to 60\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and decreased the operation cost by 50%. These results provided an approachable way for sharing the extraordinary capacity of ozone for contaminants remediation in industrial applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
