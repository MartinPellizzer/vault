Being an agrarian country with a large livestock population and uncontrolled fertilizer application, India could be accountable as a major stakeholder of global NH<sub>3</sub> emissions. This study developed a comprehensive gridded (0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0) ammonia inventory for India considering 24 types of sources. The total NH<sub>3</sub> emission is estimated to be 10.54 Tg/yr in 2022, where synthetic fertilizer application accounts for \u223c47\u00a0% followed by livestock (\u223c34\u00a0%). Minor unattended sectors such as biomass burning, agricultural soil, human excrement, waste disposal, etc. contribute 0.68 Tg/yr, 0.32 Tg/yr, 0.3 Tg/yr, and 0.14 Tg/yr, respectively. The overall uncertainty of the inventory ranges around \u00b1\u00a055\u00a0%. These emission datasets are essential for atmospheric chemistry models and could be a crucial tool for policymakers to combat ammonia pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
