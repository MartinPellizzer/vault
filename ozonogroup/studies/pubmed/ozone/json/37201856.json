One of the issues most relevant to the design of emission reduction policies is to distinguish the O<sub>3</sub> chemical regime. Here a method of quantifying the fraction of the radical loss versus NO<sub>x</sub> chemistry was applied to identify the O<sub>3</sub> chemical regime inferred from the weekly pattern of atmospheric O<sub>3</sub>, CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>, which were monitored by Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China (MEEC). During spring and autumn, O<sub>3</sub> and the total odd oxygen (O<sub>x</sub>, O<sub>x</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>2</sub>) weekend afternoon concentrations are both higher than the weekday values during 2015-2019 except in 2016, while CO and NO<sub>x</sub> weekend morning concentrations were generally both smaller than weekday values except 2017. Results from the calculated values of fraction of the radical loss by NO<sub>x</sub> chemistry relative to total radical loss (L<sub>n</sub>/Q) suggested a volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regime at this site in the spring of 2015-2019, as expected from the decreasing trend in NO<sub>x</sub> concentration and essentially constant CO after 2017. With respect to autumn, a shift from a transition regime during 2015-2017 to a VOC-limited regime in 2018 was found, which rapidly took place to a NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime in 2019. No significant differences were detected in the L<sub>n</sub>/Q values under different assumptions on photolysis frequencies both in spring and autumn mostly from 2015 to 2019, giving the same conclusion of determining the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity regime. This study develops a new method in determining the O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity regime in the typical season in China and provides insight into efficient O<sub>3</sub> control strategies in different seasons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
