The effects of the reaction temperature and the ozone to toluene concentration ratio on the catalyst performance were investigated. The optimized MnO<sub>2</sub>-260 catalyst prepared at the limiting hydrothermal temperature (260 \u00b0C) showed high catalytic activity (<i>X</i><sub>Tol</sub> = 95%) and excellent stability (1200 min) at the approximately ambient temperature of 40 \u00b0C, which was superior to the results in previous studies. The structure and morphology of \u03b4-MnO<sub>2</sub> were characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and other techniques. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations were in agreement that surface oxygen vacancy clusters, especially surface oxygen dimer vacancies, are critical in ozone activation. Oxygen vacancies can facilitate the adsorption and activation of O<sub>3</sub> to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS, including <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH), leading to superior ozonation activity to degrade toluene and intermediates. Meanwhile, free radical detection and scavenger tests indicated that <sup>\u2022</sup>OH is the primary ROS during toluene ozonation rather than <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuqin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5258-906X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2124-0620"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Changbin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8476-8217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Key Laboratory of Urban Pollutant Conversion, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36691294", "10.1021/acs.est.2c07661"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
