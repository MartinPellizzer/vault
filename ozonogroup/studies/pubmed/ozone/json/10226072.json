Using a specially designed organ culture system, we examined the influence of ozone (0.06 to 0. 2 ppm) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2, 200 and 800 micrograms/m3) on nasal mucosa exposed for 24 h. Tissue was obtained from 105 patients undergoing surgical therapy (septoplasty and reduction of the inferior turbinates) for chronic nasal obstruction. The histamine content in the culture medium of ozone- and NO2-exposed samples was significantly elevated compared with the control cultures. This elevation was correlated with the number of degranulated mast cells in the tissue determined by histomorphometry (P < 0.001). Moreover, the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta (P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.01), IL-8 (P < 0.001), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, P < 0. 001) were significantly increased (ozone 0.1 ppm). Furthermore, we found significant increases in the release of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha of ozone-exposed (0.1 ppm) samples of atopic versus nonatopic patients and to a lesser extent for histamine following exposure to 0.15 ppm ozone. These results indicate that low ozone concentrations and NO2 lead to an inflammation of human nasal mucosa in vitro and that priming factors such as atopy or preexisting inflammation do increase the sensitivity to ozone and NO2. This organ culture system proved to be a good experimental design for studying pathophysiologic alterations of human nasal mucosa under different experimental conditions (e.g., air pollutants)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Immunology and Asthma-OPD, and Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Virchow-Klinikum, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany. katrin.schierhorn@charite.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schierhorn", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matthias", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kunkel", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Release"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10226072", "10.1165/ajrcmb.20.5.3268"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
