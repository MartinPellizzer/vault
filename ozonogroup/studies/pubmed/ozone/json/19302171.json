They also reduced the sensitivity of stomatal closure to soil drying around the roots. Such effects could already be occurring under current northern hemisphere peak ambient ozone concentrations. Leaves detached from plants which had been exposed to elevated ozone concentrations generated higher concentrations of ethylene, although leaf tissue ABA concentrations were unaffected. When intact plants were pretreated with the ethylene receptor binding antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene, the stomatal response to both applied ABA and soil drying was fully restored in the presence of elevated ozone. Implications of ethylene's antagonism of the stomatal response to ABA under oxidative stress are discussed. We suggest that this may be one mechanism whereby elevated ozone induces visible injury in sensitive species. We emphasize that drought linked to climate change and tropospheric ozone pollution, are both escalating problems. Ozone will exacerbate the deleterious effects of drought on the many plant species including valuable crops that respond to this pollutant by emitting more ethylene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK. sally.wilkinson@lancaster.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilkinson", "ForeName": "Sally", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "William J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopropanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "72S9A8J5GW", "NameOfSubstance": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J6UJO23JGU", "NameOfSubstance": "1-methylcyclopropene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopropanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19302171", "10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01970.x", "PCE1970"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
