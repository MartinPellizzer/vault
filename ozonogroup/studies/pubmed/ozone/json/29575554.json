The role of the solar spectrum, comprised of ultraviolet light, specifically UVB (290-320\u00a0nm) and UVA (320-400) in causing skin damage, including skin cancers, has been well documented. In recent years, the contribution of visible light (400-700\u00a0nm) and infrared radiation (above 800\u00a0nm) in causing skin damage, similar to the photodamage caused by UV light, is also being elucidated. In addition, other atmospheric factors such as air pollution (smog, ozone, particulate matter, etc.) have been implicated in premature skin aging. The skin damage caused by environmental exposure is largely attributable to a complex cascade of reactions inside the skin initiated by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes oxidative damage to cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. These damaged skin cells initiate inflammatory responses leading to the eventual damage manifested in chronically exposed skin. Novel therapeutic strategies to combat ROS species generation are being developed to prevent the skin damage caused by atmospheric factors. In addition to protecting skin from solar radiation using sunscreens, other approaches using topically applied ingredients, particularly antioxidants that penetrate the skin and protect the skin from within, have also been well documented. This review summarizes current knowledge of atmospheric aggressors, including UVA, UVB, visible light, infrared radiation (IR), and ozone on skin damage, and proposes new avenues for future research in the prevention and treatment of premature skin aging caused by such atmospheric factors. New therapeutic modalities currently being developed are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "McDaniel Laser and Cosmetic Center and McDaniel Institute of Anti-Aging Research, Virginia Beach, VA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hampton University Skin of Color Research Institute, Hampton, VA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Hampton University, Hampton, VA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7595-5456"], "LastName": "McDaniel", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology at Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Old Metairie Dermatology, Metairie, LA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farris", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plants for Human Health Institute, Department of Animal Sciences, NC State University, Kannapolis, NC, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Cosmet Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "101130964", "ISSNLinking": "1473-2130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Infrared Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29575554", "10.1111/jocd.12518"]}}]}
