Given the potential health hazards associated with VOC exposure, it is necessary to estimate the indoor VOC emission strengths. In this study, the indoor and outdoor concentrations of 43 VOCs were concurrently measured in 8 urban residences, Beijing. The indoor/outdoor concentration ratio was used to screen out 36 species having significant indoor sources. A one-compartment steady-state model was developed to estimate the indoor emission strengths of these VOCs, in which ventilation and reaction with ozone were included as sink routes. The order of VOCs in terms of indoor emission strength was d-limonene (a median value of 1.05 g/h), \u03b1-pinene (82.50 mg/h), styrene (24.12 mg/h), \u00df-pinene (9.70 mg/h), formaldehyde (1.97 mg/h), n-dodecane (1.82 mg/h), n-pentadecane (1.66 mg/h), n-hexadecane (1.62 mg/h), n-undecane (1.20 mg/h), acetaldehyde (1.05 mg/h) and 1, 4-dichlorobenzene (0.80 mg/h). The sum of estimates of those VOCs accounted for >95% of total emission strength. Specific indoor sources of those VOCs in the tested homes were identified. Air exchange rate, indoor temperature and air humidity were found to pose significant impacts to the indoor emission strengths of VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
