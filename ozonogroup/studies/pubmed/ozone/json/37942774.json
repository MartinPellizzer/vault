Using electrospray ionization-coupled Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS), this study investigated the molecular characteristics of unknown OBPs and their formation mechanisms during the treatment of flocculated nanofiltration concentrate (FNFC) using the O<sub>3</sub> and UV/O<sub>3</sub> processes. The results showed that after being treated by the O<sub>3</sub> and UV/O<sub>3</sub> processes, the average value of the oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C<sub>avg</sub>) in the FNFC organic matter increased substantially from 0.49 to 0.61-0.64 and 0.63-0.71, respectively, with an O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 13.4-54.4 mg/min. The main OBPs were CHO and CHON compounds, which were mainly produced through oxygenation (+O<sub>2</sub>/+O<sub>3</sub> and -H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>), oxidative deamination (-NH<sub>3</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>), decyclopropyl (-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), and deisopropyl (-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) reactions. The hydroxyl radical (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) can intensify these reactions, resulting in an abundance of OBPs with a high oxidation degree and low molecular weight. OBPs at five <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values were fragmented and analyzed with tandem mass spectrometry, and abundant hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, and carbonyl groups were tentatively identified, presenting a potential toxicity to aquatic organisms. Due to the high molecular diversity of the OBPs in FNFC, their lower \u0394<i>G</i><sub><i>Cox</i></sub><sup>o</sup> compared to natural fulvic acid, and potential toxicity, their impact on the water environment should be given more attention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Weiming", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1187-4734"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Zhepei", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7529-6366"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, China University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4146-5790"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qibin", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37942774", "10.1021/acs.est.3c05134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
