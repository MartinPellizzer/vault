Many studies reported that the COVID-19 lockdown impacted PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), etc. VOCs play important roles in the production of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Ambient VOCs in Xiong'an were measured from December 25, 2019 to January 24, 2020 (prior to epidemic prevention, P1) and from January 25, 2020 to February 24, 2020 (during epidemic prevention, P2) through a VOCs online instrument. In the study, VOCs characteristics and ozone generation potential (OFP) of ambient VOCs were analyzed, and source apportionment of VOCs were analyzed by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). The results showed that <i>\u03c6</i>(TVOCs) during epidemic prevention and control was 45.1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, which was approximately half of that before epidemic prevention and control (90.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>). The chemical composition of VOCs showed significant changes after epidemic prevention and control, the contribution rate of alkanes increased from 37.6% to 53.8%, and the contribution rate of aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons decreased from 13.3% and 12.0% to 7.5% and 7.8%, respectively. Aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and OVOCs decreased by more than 60%. Seven types of the top ten species were the same before and during the epidemic prevention and control, mainly low-carbon alkanes, olefins, aldehydes, and ketones. Dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and BTEXs decreased significantly. The OPP was 566 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 231 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in P1 and P2, respectively. The OPP of VOCs decreased by more than 30%. The proportion of OFP contribution of aromatic hydrocarbons decreased significantly after the epidemic prevention and control, and the proportion of OFP contribution of alkanes and alkynes increased significantly. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was then applied for VOCs sources apportionment. Six sources were identified, including background sources, oil-gas volatile sources, combustion sources, industrial sources, solvent use sources, and vehicle exhaust sources. The results showed that after the epidemic prevention and control, the contribution rate of solvent use sources to TVOCs decreased from 24% to 9%. The contribution rates of background sources, oil-gas volatile sources, and combustion sources increased from 13%, 34%, and 24% to 6%, 14%, and 13%, respectively. The relative contributions of vehicle exhaust sources before and after epidemic prevention and control were 21% and 18%, respectively. The observation points were affected by the emission of VOCs from paroxysmal industrial sources before the epidemic prevention and control. The emission was stopped after the epidemic prevention and control, and its contribution rate was reduced from 22% before the epidemic prevention and control to 1%. The concentrations of industrial sources, solvent sources, motor vehicle tail gas sources, and combustion sources decreased by 97%, 82%, 61%, and 15%, respectively, after the epidemic prevention and control. The concentration of background sources remained stable, and the concentration of oil and gas volatile sources increased by 7%. The control of production and traffic activities cannot reduce the emission of VOCs from oil and gas volatile sources, which is the focus of VOCs control in Xiong'an."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Province Ecology Environmental Monitoring Center, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Province Ecology Environmental Monitoring Center, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-Juan", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Province Ecology Environmental Monitoring Center, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Province Ecology Environmental Monitoring Center, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Li-Ru", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Province Ecology Environmental Monitoring Center, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Cui-Qing", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Province Ecology Environmental Monitoring Center, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Provincial Academy of Ecological Environmental Science, Shijiazhuang 050037, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Wen-Kang", "Initials": "WK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35258190", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202106253"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
