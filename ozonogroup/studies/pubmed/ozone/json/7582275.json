Seven dogs from random sources were studied three times, at least 2 wk apart. On each occasion, acetylcholine (Ach) airway responsiveness was measured before and 1 h after ozone (3 ppm, 30 min) or dry air inhalation, followed by a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). On the first day, dogs were treated with SC-53228 (0.4 mg/kg intravenously) followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 1.2 mg/kg/h before ozone inhalation. On the other two days, diluent was infused followed by ozone or dry air inhalation. Cell counts were measured in BAL and cell activation was measured by spontaneous and by phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated (PMA) (2.4 mumol/L) oxygen radical release, measured from washed BAL cells (4 x 10(6) cells) by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. Ozone inhalation caused bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness. SC-53228 inhibited the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (p = 0.006), but not the bronchoconstriction. Spontaneous (p = 0.004) and PMA-stimulated (p = 0.04) lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence were increased after ozone inhalation. The ozone-induced increases in PMA-stimulated chemiluminescence were significantly attenuated by treatment with SC-53228 (p = 0.04). These results suggest that LTB4 is involved in the pathogenesis of ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, possibly through activation of airway inflammatory cell."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vanderheyden", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wattie", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lane", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Byrne", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Leukotriene B4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "141059-52-1", "NameOfSubstance": "7-(3-(2-(cyclopropylmethyl)-3-methoxy-4-((methylamino)carbonyl)phenoxy)propoxy)-3,4-dihydro-8-propyl-2H-1-benzopyran-2-propanoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzamides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstriction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Leukotriene B4"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Burst"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7582275", "10.1164/ajrccm.152.5.7582275"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
