The remediation of lignin was realized using the combination of the pre-treatment with chemical precipitation, using concentrated sulfuric acid (97.1%) at the pH 1 and 3, and of the simple ozonation of the filtered residual water at the pH 1, 3, 8 and 12. Since the high residues content (the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) is 70,000 mg/L) in the experiments the diluted samples (1:10) were used. The previous precipitation has showed a significant effect on the reduction of the COD (77%) and color (96.1%). The sludge precipitated contents sulfolignin, which in the reaction with sulfuric acid was formed. In ozonation of the filtered residual water during 25 min at the pH 1, 3, 8 and 12 the follows by-products were formed: fumaric, maleic, malonic and formic acids. The biodegradability of the treated water in ozonation increases up 0.067-0.29. The effect of the precipitation and the ozonation conditions on the decolorization kinetics was evaluated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Superior School of Chemical Engineering, National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico, UPALM, DF, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De los Santos Ramos", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poznyak", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chairez", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "C\u00f3rdova R", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O40UQP6WCF", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfuric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19464112", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.03.152", "S0304-3894(09)00514-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
