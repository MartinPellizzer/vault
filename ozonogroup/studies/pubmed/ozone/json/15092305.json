Plants of the cultivars 'New Yorker' and 'Tiny Tim' were grown at 25/15 degrees or 30/15 degrees day/night temperatures in growth chambers and exposed to 0.00, 0.08, 0.16 or 0.24 microl litre(-1) O(3) for 7 h day(-1) for four consecutive days in controlled environment exposure chambers. Measurement of Chl in the top, middle and bottom canopy leaves with a calibrated SPAD-501 leaf greenness meter indicated that the growth temperatures tested did not significantly influence the response of Chl to O(3). Ozone-induced loss of Chl was widespread in the entire foliage canopy, including foliage which did not demonstrate visible injury. In both cultvars the Chl in leaves at all three canopy levels declined as a function of increasing O(3) concentration when measured 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days after the exposure period. However, the slopes for leaves in the top and middle canopies decreased with increasing time after exposure. An analysis of this apparent Chl recovery indicated that leaves in the top and middle canopies exposed to 0.16 and 0.24 microl litre(-1) increased in greenness at a rapid rate after the marked initial decline associated with O(3) treatment. The apparent recovery of the top canopy may have reflected the growth of new leaves and their inclusion in the measurements, but this was not the case for the middle canopy for which the same leaves were measured throughout the post-exposure period. Bottom canopy leaves did not demonstrate significant recovery of Chl."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tenga", "ForeName": "A Z", "Initials": "AZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormrod", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092305", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90093-r", "0269-7491(90)90093-R"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
