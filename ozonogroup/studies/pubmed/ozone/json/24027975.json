Monthly, seasonal variation and statistical diurnal variation characteristics of air pollutants were analyzed. Besides, the influence of transportation to air pollutants was also discussed combined with the back trajectories of air mass. The average concentrations of NO, NO2, NO(x), O3, SO2 and PM2.5 were (2.0 +/- 1.6), (13.2 +/- 7.2), (15.3 +/- 8.2), (61.0 +/- 19.6), (3.6 +/- 3.6) and (35.6 +/- 32.0) microg x m(-3), respectively. The concentration of pollutants in Beijing forest ecology observation site was lower than that in rural observation site in Beijing. The highest value of NO(x) appeared in autumn while the lowest appeared in summer, and concentrations of NO(x) in autumn and summer were (17.0 +/- 8.0) microg x m(-3) and (13.8 +/- 4.1) microg x m(-3), respectively. Concentrations of O3 in spring and summer were higher than those in autumn and winter. The highest concentration of O3 appeared in June. The concentration of SO2 in winter was the highest, and this concentration was 2.7 times to the lowest concentration in summer. The highest concentration of PM2.5 appeared in summer and was 56.4 microg x m(-3). There were obvious diurnal variation of NO(x), O3 and SO2. There are two peaks of NO(x) have been observed, however there are only one peak of O3 and SO2 has been observed. There was no obvious diurnal variation of PM2.5 to other pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yang-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-Si", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24027975"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
