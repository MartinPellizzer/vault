Ozone has been applied in various ways in the food industry. One useful advantage of ozone is that it inactivates molds. In this study, a cheese ripening room was ozonated, and the effectiveness of this treatment was evaluated both in air and on surfaces through sampling on a weekly basis over a 3-month period. The results obtained indicate that ozone treatment reduced the viable airborne mold load but did not affect viable mold on surfaces. Only by wiping the surfaces with a commercial sanitizer was it possible to decrease the viable mold load on surfaces. To improve overall hygiene in the ripening room, a combination of cleaning regimes is recommended. The mold genera occurring most frequently in the air of the cheese ripening room were Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Aspergillus, which accounted for 89.9% of the mold isolates. Penicillium and Aspergillus were identified to the species level, and data showed that P. brevicompactum and P. aurantiogriseum, as well as A. versicolor, were the species most frequently isolated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Engenharia Biol\u00f3gica, Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Serra", "ForeName": "Rita", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abrunhosa", "ForeName": "Lu\u00eds", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kozakiewicz", "ForeName": "Zofia", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ven\u00e2ncio", "ForeName": "Armando", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lima", "ForeName": "Nelson", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cheese"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cladosporium"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14672237", "10.4315/0362-028x-66.12.2355", "S0362-028X(22)03364-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
