The dynamics is set up within the energy transfer mechanism and the kinetic scheme is the steady-state approximation. We applied this model to the formation of ozone O + O2 + M --> O3 + M for M = Ar, making use of semiquantitative potential energy surfaces. The stabilization process is treated by means of the vibrational close-coupling infinite order sudden scattering theory. Major approximations include the neglect of the O3 vibrational bending mode and rovibrational couplings. We calculated individual isotope-specific rate constants and rate constant ratios over the temperature range 10-1000 K and the pressure fall-off region 10(-7)-10(2) bar. The present results show a qualitative and semiquantitative agreement with available experiments, particularly in the temperature region of atmospheric interest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Charlo", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clary", "ForeName": "David C", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15268414", "10.1063/1.1635361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
