The main removal routes for HOCl are photolysis and the reaction with OH during the daytime, while these processes are unimportant during the nighttime. Here, we report the rapid reactions of Criegee intermediates (CH<sub>2</sub>OO and <i>anti</i>/<i>syn</i>-CH<sub>3</sub>CHOO) with HOCl by using high-level quantum chemical methods as the benchmark; their accuracy is close to coupled cluster theory with single, double, and triple excitations and quasiperturbative connected quadruple excitations with a complete basis limit by extrapolation [CCSDT(Q)/CBS]. Their rate constants have been calculated by using a dual-level strategy; this combines conventional transition state theory calculated at the benchmark level with variational transition state theory with small-curvature tunneling by a validated density functional method. We find that the introduction of the methyl group into Criegee intermediates not only affects their reactivities but also exerts a remarkable influence on anharmonicity. The calculated results uncover that anharmonicity increases the rate constants of CH<sub>2</sub>OO + HOCl by a factor of 18-5, while it is of minor importance in the <i>anti</i>/<i>syn</i>-CH<sub>3</sub>CHOO + HOCl reaction at 190-350 K. The present findings reveal that the loose transition state for <i>anti</i>-CH<sub>3</sub>CHOO and HOCl is a rate-determining step at 190-350 K. We also find that the reaction of Criegee intermediates with HOCl contributes significantly to the sink of HOCl during the nighttime in the atmosphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Physics and Mechatronic Engineering, Guizhou Minzu University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Qiong", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5461-1486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences and Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}], "LastName": "Francisco", "ForeName": "Joseph S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9358-2585"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Physics and Mechatronic Engineering, Guizhou Minzu University, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Guizhou Minzu University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38271208", "10.1021/acs.jpca.3c06144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
