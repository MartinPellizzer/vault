The Lake and Porter counties through which this expressway passes are designated as particulate matter < 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and ozone 8-hr standard nonattainment areas. The Purdue University air quality group has been collecting PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), wind speed, wind direction, pressure, and temperature data since September 1999. In this work, regression and neural network models were developed for forecasting hourly PM2.5 and CO concentrations. Time series of PM2.5 and CO concentrations, traffic data, and meteorological parameters were used for developing the neural network and regression models. The models were compared using a number of statistical quality indicators. Both models had reasonable accuracy in predicting hourly PM2.5 concentration with coefficient of determination -0.80, root mean square error (RMSE) <4 microg/m3, and index of agreement (IA) > 0.90. For CO prediction, both models showed moderate forecasting performance with a coefficient of determination -0.55, RMSE < 0.50 ppm, and IA -0.85. These models are computationally less cumbersome and require less number of predictors as compared with the deterministic models. The availability of real time PM2.5 and CO forecasts will help highway managers to identify air pollution episodic events beforehand and to determine mitigation strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47906, USA. thomas68@purdue.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "Salimol", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacko", "ForeName": "Robert B", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17458467", "10.3155/1047-3289.57.4.480"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
