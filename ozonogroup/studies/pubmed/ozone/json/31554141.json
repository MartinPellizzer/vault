However, limited evidence is available on the contributory role of air pollution on conjunctivitis, particularly in China.", "We obtained data of 81,351 conjunctivitis outpatients from the largest comprehensive hospitals of four cities, China, between Jan 1, 2013 and Dec 31, 2014. Data on air pollutants, including particulate matter \u22642.5\u202f\u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter \u226410\u202f\u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) were collected from China National Environmental Monitoring Centre. Conjunctivitis outpatient visits were linked with air pollution concentrations by the visiting dates. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression model was used to examine the effect of short-term exposure to air pollution on conjunctivitis outpatient visits.", "We found that the associations between air pollutants (per 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase) and hospital outpatient visits for asthma were [odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals]: 1.004(1.002-1.007) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 1.004 (1.002-1.005) for PM<sub>10</sub>, 1.012(1.005-1.020) for NO<sub>2</sub>, 1.006 (1.001-1.011) for SO<sub>2</sub>, and 1.007 (1.003-1.010) for O<sub>3</sub>, respectively at lag0 day.
