The results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> episodes accounted for 25.8% of the whole observation period, mostly occurring from May to September. The concentration of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> in urban areas was higher than that in suburban areas, whereas the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> and VOCs were lower. The hourly rate of variation in each pollutant had obvious seasonal characteristics; for example, the time of O<sub>3</sub> rise and precursor decline in autumn and winter was approximately 1 h later than that in summer, and the peak period of O<sub>3</sub> generation and accumulation was shortened. The increase rate in O<sub>3</sub> in urban areas was higher than that in suburban areas. Correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis were used to study the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and its influencing factors. The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> was negatively correlated with precursors and relative humidity and positively correlated with visibility, temperature, and wind speed, and these factors interacted with each other. According to the multivariate linear regression analysis, the main controlling factors in urban areas were relative humidity, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, visibility, and VOCs, whereas in suburban areas they were relative humidity, temperature, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Yan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Jin-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34989501", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202105009"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
