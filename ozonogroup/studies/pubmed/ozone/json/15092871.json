In view of the fact that these chamber-derived CLs are based on ozone (O(3)) concentrations at the top of the canopy the correct application to ambient conditions presupposes the application of Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) models for quantifying trace gas exchange between phytosphere and atmosphere. Especially in the context of establishing control strategies based on flux-oriented dose-response relationships, O(3) flux measurements and O(3) exchange simulations are needed for representative ecosystems. During the last decades several micrometeorological methods for quantifying energy and trace gas exchange were developed, as well as models for the simulation of the exchange of trace gases between phytosphere and atmosphere near the ground. This paper is a synthesis of observational and modeling techniques which discusses measurement methods, assumptions, and limitations and current modeling approaches. Because stomatal resistance for trace gas exchange is parameterized as a function of water vapor or carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange, the most important micrometeorological techniques especially for quantifying O(3), water vapor and CO(2) flux densities are discussed. A comparison of simulated and measured O(3) flux densities shows good agreement in the mean."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Plant Ecology, University of Giessen, Heinrich Buff-Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany. ludger.gruenhage@bot2.bio.uni-giessen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gr\u00fcnhage", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haenel", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00e4ger", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092871", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00041-5", "S0269-7491(00)00041-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
