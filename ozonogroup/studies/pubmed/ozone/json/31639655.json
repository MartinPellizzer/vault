The role of air pollution exposure to racial/ethnic differences in hypertension has not been explored.", "To assess the potential mediating effects of ambient air pollution on the association between race/ethnicity and blood pressure levels.", "We studied 6,463 White, Black, Hispanic and Chinese adults enrolled across 6 US cities. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at Exam 1 (2000-2002) and Exam 2 (2002-2004). Household-level annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>X</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) for the year 2000 were estimated for participants.", "The difference in SBP levels by race/ethnicity that was related to higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations compared with White men (\"indirect associations\") was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) mmHg for Black men, 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) mmHg for Hispanic men and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.2, 1.8) mmHg for Chinese men. Findings were similar although not statistically significant for women. PM<sub>2.5</sub> did not mediate racial/ethnic differences in DBP. Indirect associations were significant for O<sub>3</sub> for SBP among women and men and for DBP among men. In contrast, racial/ethnic disparities were attenuated due to exposure to NO<sub>X</sub>.", "Racial disparities in blood pressure were reduced after accounting for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone while increased after accounting for NO<sub>X.</sub>"], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
