After 15min oxidation, samples were extracted using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, and tested in vitro to measure the estrogenic activities of the oxidized products. MCF-7 cell proliferation assay showed that chlorinated BPA solution displayed slightly stronger estrogenicity than BPA, while chlorinated NP retained about one-tenth of its bioactivity. The estrogenic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-ClBPAs and di-ClNP were screened out from the corresponding chlorinated products by a combined application of estrogen receptor (ER) binding with ultrafiltration and identified by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Ozonation of the above four estrogens and chlorination of E2 and EE2 significantly decreased their estrogenic activities under the applied conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "San Jose Creek Water Quality Control Laboratory, Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, 1965 Workman Mill Road, Whittier, CA 90601, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jianghua", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carr", "ForeName": "Steve", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rinaldi", "ForeName": "Kurt", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chandler", "ForeName": "Wayne", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9612020", "ISSNLinking": "1382-6689"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21783600", "10.1016/j.etap.2005.01.008", "S1382-6689(05)00026-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
