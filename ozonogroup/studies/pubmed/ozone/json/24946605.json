Mer.] was exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CFA), non-filtered air (NFA) and non-filtered air with ozone addition (NFA + O3) in nine open-top chambers. Individual yield and yield components at maturity, C, N concentration in leaf and seed, gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and pigments content at the full bloom stage were measured with an AOT40 value of 10.6 microL x L(-1) x h during the growing season. Compared to CFA, NFA reduced individual yield and 100-seed weight by 4.5% and 4% respectivley, while NFA + O3 treatment significantly reduced each of them by 34% and 18%. However, plant height, node numbers of main stem, pods per plant and number of seeds per pod remained unchanged by O3 addition. Leaf C, N concentrations at the seed filling stage under NFA + O3 also significantly increased by 3% and 26%, respectively, while the CN ratio significantly decreased by 18%. Moreover, compared to CFA and NFA, NFA + O3 caused significant reductions in the photosynthetic parameters at the full bloom stage, e.g. significant declines in net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, fluorescence parameters of F'(v)/F'(m) and phi(PS II). It is proposed that lower photosynthetic rates, reduced photochemical efficiency in PS II and the decline in 100-seed weight might be the main reasons contributing to the lower individual yield of soybean plant by elevated O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guang-Hua", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mei-Yu", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bing", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24946605"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
