GEM is chemically stable and has a long residence time in the atmosphere; hence, it can be transported over long distances with air masses and is regarded as a global pollutant. We study the transportation and transformation mechanisms of GEM and its potential anthropogenic and natural contribution sources. GEM, conventional atmospheric pollutants, and meteorological parameters were monitored at a coastal site in Ningbo during the summer and autumn of 2017. The results were as follows. \u2460 The concentrations of GEM ranged from 0.97-10.95 ng\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and the mean and standard deviation (SD) were (2.32\u00b10.90) ng\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, whereby the mean summer concentration was lower than the mean autumn concentration. \u2461 The diurnal variations of GEM, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) during summer/autumn and sunny/rainy days suggest that higher levels of O<sub>3</sub> and that strong solar radiation accounted for the rapid photochemical oxidation of GEM. The intensity of oxidation on sunny days was higher than that on rainy days. \u2462 Correlation analysis showed that GEM was significantly positively correlated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> (<i>R</i>=0.65, <i>P</i><0.01), PM<sub>10</sub> (<i>R</i>=0.47, <i>P</i><0.01), NO<sub>2</sub> (<i>R</i>=0.46, <i>P</i><0.01), and CO (<i>R</i>=0.57, <i>P</i><0.01). Local and regional sources of GEM were mainly related to fossil fuel combustion. \u2463 The photochemical oxidation rate of GEM was influenced by the concentrations of oxidants (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>), gas-particle partitioning between GEM and particles, and light extinction effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, water vapor, and NO<sub>2</sub>. \u2464 Potential source contribution analysis (PSCF) indicated that the northwestern Zhejiang Province (including Ningbo City), the southern Anhui Province, and most of Jiangxi Province constitute a triangular area that is a potential source contribution to NBUEORS atmospheric GEM pollution during the summer. Local, regional, and long-range sources all had strong impacts on GEM pollution. During the autumn, the potential sources were mainly in the northern Zhejiang Province, and the source was smaller than that during the summer. GEM pollution during the autumn was mainly influenced by local and regional sources. Therefore, the control of atmospheric GEM pollution in the Yangtze River delta should apply inter-regional prevention and comprehensive control strategies in order to reduce atmospheric mercury pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
