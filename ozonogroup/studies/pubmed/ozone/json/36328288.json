Previous studies on global concentrations and emissions have mostly relied on ground-based observations. Here, we assess the global concentrations and emissions of eight MP controlled substances and methyl chloride from ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment high-resolution infrared Fourier transform spectrometer) satellite observations: CFC-11 (CFCl<sub>3</sub>), CFC-12 (CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), CCl<sub>4</sub>, HCFC-22 (CHClF<sub>2</sub>), HCFC-141b (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>F), HCFC-142b (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>ClF<sub>2</sub>), HFC-23 (CHF<sub>3</sub>), HFC-134a (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>), and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl. Results show that the ACE-FTS satellite observations can be used to derive the concentrations and emissions of these ODSs, HFCs, and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, as they are consistent with those derived from the ground-based observations. Our findings imply that the changes in the concentrations and emissions of the ODSs and HFCs closely match the regulatory status of the MP, and satellite observations can be used to monitor the past and future progress of the MP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
