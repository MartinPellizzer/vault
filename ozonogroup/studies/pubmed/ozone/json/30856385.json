Nuts were inoculated with either Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or a potential Salmonella surrogate, Enterococcus faecium OSY 31284. The effect of inoculation method (with or without vacuum application), and of drying inoculated nuts (up to three days) on treatment efficacy was investigated. Inoculated nuts were subjected to gaseous ozone alone (almonds, pistachios) or ozone in combination with heating in brine solution (pistachios). Ozone treatment included application of vacuum (10 in Hg), followed by vessel pressurization to 12.5 psig with ozone\u2011oxygen mixture (160\u202fg ozone/m<sup>3</sup> gas mixture) and holding for 30\u202fmin. Heating was conducted in a brine solution (5% NaCl) at 70\u202f\u00b0C, for 10\u202fmin. Ozone-based treatments were significantly more effective (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) on almonds than pistachios, with maximum S. Enteritidis reduction of 2.9 vs. 0.8\u202flog\u202fCFU/g, regardless of inoculation method or the drying time. Treatment of inoculated pistachios with heated brine and gaseous ozone reduced S. Enteritidis population by 5.0 to 7.0\u202flog\u202fCFU/g and was not significantly more effective than treatment with heated brine alone (reduction of 4.8 to 7.1\u202flog\u202fCFU/g). Application of vacuum during inoculation increased bacterial population on nut kernels by approximately 1.2\u202flog\u202fCFU/g, but the increase in inoculum population had no effect on inactivation of either species of inoculated bacteria. Decontamination treatments were less effective against both bacteria by up to 2\u202flog\u202fCFU/g when drying time of inoculated nuts increased. E. faecium was significantly more resistant to heat and ozone treatment (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) than was S. Enteritidis on pistachios, but not on almonds. Results of this study show that laboratory methodology affects observed treatment effectiveness. Considering its high resistance to the heat-ozone combination, E. faecium may not be a suitable surrogate for S. Enteritidis during processing of pistachios by this treatment. Efficacy of ozone gas to decontaminate S. Enteritidis-inoculated nuts depends heavily on the type of nut. Although reductions of S. Enteritidis populations on in-shell pistachios are low, treatment of in-shell almonds resulted in greater reductions, indicating the promise of this technology to enhance the safety of specific nut products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
