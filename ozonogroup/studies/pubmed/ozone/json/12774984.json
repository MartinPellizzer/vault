Emission tests were carried out on a dynamometer following the designated test procedure of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE). Samples were derived during various driving stages, which included idle, acceleration, 30 km/hr cruise, 50 km/hr cruise, and deceleration. All test motorcycles (10 new and 15 in-use) complied with Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration's Phase III Motorcycle Emission Standards. The dominant volatile organic carbon (VOC) species were isopentane (53 and 295 mg/km, 2- and 4-stroke, respectively), 2-methylpentane (75 and 83 mg/km), 3-methylpentane (34 and 66 mg/km), and toluene (30 and 100 mg/km). The VOC emission factors for the 2-/4-stroke motorcycles were 311/344 (new) and 1479/433 (in-use) mg/km, respectively. In addition, the dominant carbonyl species for the new and in-use motorcycles were formaldehyde (0.4 and 0.7 mg/km, respectively), acetaldehyde (0.6 and 1.2 mg/km), and acetone (0.5 and 0.7 mg/km). The carbonyl compound emission factors for the 2- and 4-stroke motorcycles were 3.2/3.1 (new) and 5.3/4.6 (in-use) mg/km, respectively. The ozone formation potentials, based on an ECE test cycle, show that the values from the in-use motorcycles were higher than those from the new motorcycles. The dominant VOC species for the ozone formation potential were propylene (65 and 502 mg-O3/km, respectively), isopentane (98 and 501 mg-O3/km), 2-methylpentane (152 and 167 mg-O3/ km), 3-methylpentane (79 and 253 mg-O3/km), and toluene (127 and 398 mg-O3/km). Further, the dominant carbonyl species were formaldehyde (4.1 and 6.2 mg-O3/ km, new and in-use, respectively) and acetaldehyde (4.8 and 9 mg-O3/km)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Jiun-Horng", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Yin", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Hung-Lung", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Li-Peng", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12774984", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466199"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
