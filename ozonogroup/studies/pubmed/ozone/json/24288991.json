Results indicated that sigma PFCs residue in water was higher in spring and summer than that in fall and winter. The vast majority of PFCs in samples were of short and medium chains (C < or = 10), and perfluorooctane sulfonate was the most typical residue species. Among the five water treatment stages, sedimentation, sand filtration and ozonation with activated carbon filtration can remove PFCs, while flocculation and chlorination significantly raise the levels of short- (C < or = 6) and medium-chain (10 > or = C > or = 7) PFCs, respectively, causing sigma PFCs increase in finished water by 10%-44% compared to raw water. However, the PFCs residues in finished water are still far below their limit values, posing no threat against human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Physics Science and Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China. zhangh@snu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qing-wu", "Initials": "QW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin-xuan", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Zhi-fang", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jin-can", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guo-qing", "Initials": "GQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanesulfonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9H2MAI21CL", "NameOfSubstance": "perfluorooctane sulfonic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanesulfonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24288991"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
