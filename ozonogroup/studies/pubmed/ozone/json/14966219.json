In this study, the role of pollutant exclusion in mediating this response was investigated through growth chamber-based investigations on leaves 4 and 7 of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Hanno). In the core experiments, plants were raised at two atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient [350 micro l l(-1)] or elevated CO2 [700 micro l l(-1)] under two O3 regimes (charcoal/Purafil-filtered air [<5 nl l(-1) O3] or ozone-enriched air [75 nl l(-1) 7 h d(-1)]). A subsequent experiment used an additional O3 treatment where the goal was to achieve equivalent daily O3 uptake over the life-span of leaves 4 and 7 under ambient and CO2-enriched conditions, through daily adjustment of exposures based on measured shifts in stomatal conductance. Plant growth and net CO2 assimilation were stimulated by CO2-enrichment and reduced by exposure to O3. However, the impacts of O3 decreased with plant age (i.e. leaf 7 was more resistant to O3 injury than leaf 4); a finding consistent with ontogenic shifts in the tolerance of plant tissue and/or acclimation to O3-induced oxidative stress. In the combined treatment, elevated CO2 protected against the adverse effects of O3 and reduced cumulative O3 uptake (calculated from measurements of stomatal conductance) by c. 10% and 35% over the life-span of leaves 4 and 7, respectively. Analysis of the relationship between O3 uptake and the decline in the maximum in vivo rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax) revealed the protection afforded by CO2-enrichment to be due, to a large extent, to the exclusion of the pollutant from the leaf interior (as a consequence of the decline in stomatal conductance triggered by CO2-enrichment), but there was evidence (especially from flux-response relationships constructed for leaf 4) that CO2-enrichment resulted in additional effects that alleviated the impacts of ozone-induced oxidative stress on photosynthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Museu, Laborat\u00f3rio e Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, Universidade de Lisboa, Rua da Escola Polit\u00e9cnica 58, 1250-102 Lisboa, Portugal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cardoso-Vilhena", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balaguer", "ForeName": "Luis", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eamus", "ForeName": "Derek", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ollerenshaw", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "Jeremy", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14966219", "10.1093/jxb/erh080", "erh080"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
