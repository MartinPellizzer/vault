Wastewater from the secondary treatment effluent in the new-developed community was taken as the sample for looking into the feasibility of domestic wastewater reuse and recycling. The test results by sand filtration, sand filtration/ultrafiltration, sand filtration/ozonation, and sand filtration/ultrafiltration/ozonation were compared for looking for appropriate treatment processes applied in the domestic wastewater reuse and recycling. Finally, cost analysis was carried out and sand filtration/ozonation process was suggested to be one of the best processes. The total cost is about 0.1-0.32 USD dollars per cubic meter of produced water by considering the capital and operation cost for five years in the small domestic wastewater treatment plant (50-750 CMD)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan. chni01@ms14.hinet.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cost Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14524686", "10.1081/ese-120023401"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
