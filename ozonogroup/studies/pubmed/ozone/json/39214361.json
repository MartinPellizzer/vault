However, HONO abundance in the marine boundary layer remain largely unknown. Here, ship-based measurements were performed to characterize the origins of HONO from ship plumes, marine atmosphere, and continental emissions over South China Sea (SCS) during September 2021. The results showed that the HONO concentrations were measured at substantial levels (1.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8 ppbv) in polluted plumes due to generally high NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations (52.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f52.5 ppbv). Comparably, much lower HONO concentrations (0.086\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.102 ppbv) were observed for marine atmosphere. During nighttime, the heterogeneous conversion of NO<sub>2</sub> was the predominant source of HONO and occurred mainly on the sea surfaces through NO<sub>2</sub> deposition. The HONO yield from this deposition (the proportion of NO<sub>2</sub> that was converted to HONO) was 0.08 and 0.06 for the marine atmosphere and continental emissions, respectively. In contrast, daytime known HONO formation of marine atmospheric origins was mainly attributed to homogeneous OH\u202f+\u202fNO reaction, although the contribution of heterogeneous NO<sub>2</sub> conversion might not be negligible. Approximately half of HONO sources during daytime are unknown, which were likely from photo-enhanced NO<sub>2</sub> conversation on the sea surfaces. Our results showed that for marine atmosphere and ship plumes, the daily contributions of HONO photolysis to OH radical formation were about 20.8\u202f% and 72.2\u202f%, respectively, while the contributions from ozone photolysis were 79.2\u202f% and 27.8\u202f%. An average HONO concentration of 0.17 ppbv was measured in close shore regions when air masses originated from mainland China, with the contributions from HONO and ozone to OH radical of 21.4\u202f% and 78.6\u202f% respectively, similar to those for the marine atmosphere. This study suggests that HONO in the SCS has various sources (e.g., marine atmosphere, ship plumes, and continental emissions) and makes significant contributions to the OH abundance which affects the oxidation capacity in this area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
