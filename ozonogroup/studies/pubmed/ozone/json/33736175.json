It is hence important to develop comprehensive emissions inventory of chlorine precursors in order to enhance our understanding of the role of chlorine chemistry in ozone and secondary pollution issues. Based on a bottom-up methodology, this study presents a comprehensive emission inventory for major atomic chlorine precursors in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China for the year 2017. Four primary chlorine precursors are considered in this study: hydrogen chloride (HCl), fine particulate chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) (Cl<sup>-</sup> in PM<sub>2.5</sub>), chlorine gas (Cl<sub>2</sub>), and hypochlorous acid (HClO) with emissions estimated for twelve source categories. The total emissions of these four species in the YRD region are estimated to be 20,424\u00a0t, 15,719\u00a0t, 1556 and 9331\u00a0t, respectively. The emissions of HCl are substantial, with major emissions from biomass burning and coal combustion, together accounting for 68% of the total HCl emissions. Fine particulate Cl<sup>-</sup> is mainly emitted from industrial processing, biomass burning and waste incineration. The emissions of Cl<sub>2</sub> and HClO are mainly associated with usage of chlorine-containing disinfectants, for example, water treatment, wastewater treatment, and swimming pools. Emissions of each chlorine precursor are spatially allocated based on the characteristics of individual source category. This study provides important basic dataset for further studies with respect to the effects of chlorine chemistry on the formation of air pollution complex in the YRD region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
