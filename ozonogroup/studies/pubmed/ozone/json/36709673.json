Little is known about the spatial patterns of the AQI in terms of the magnitude, temporal variability, and predominant air pollutant contributions at the hyperlocal scale within a city. To fill this research gap, we developed spatiotemporal models for each criteria air pollutant based on an advanced geostatistical framework and estimated daily AQI levels at 100-meter resolution in a metropolitan city in 2019. The model prediction ability (cross-validation, CV, Coefficient of determination, R<sup>2</sup>, and root mean square error, RMSE) ranged from 0.43 and 1.86\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> for sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) to 0.92 and 6.25\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> for fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) across the six air pollutants, leading to good performance in the subsequent AQI estimations (CV R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.86, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a010.05). The AQI varies substantially over space at a fine scale and differs from the distributions of individual air pollutants. The unhealthy air quality (AQI\u00a0>\u00a0100 over 75\u00a0days) spatial pattern was dominated by excessive ground-level ozone exposure in a large area. Our research provides a useful tool for accurately estimating AQI spatiotemporal variations for population health studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
