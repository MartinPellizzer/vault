Ozone gas has been considered an alternative on-site disinfectant during a pandemic because it has antimicrobial activities, can be produced from air by electricity without the need for storage, and can be easily deactivated after use. However, ozone gas might become distributed at the lower layer because it has a larger molecular weight than air. This study aimed to reveal the applicability of ozone gas for the on-site disinfection of PPE. The lockers meant for changing dresses were used as ozone gas exposure boxes, and the distribution of ozone was assayed. Considering that the determined ozone levels were not consistent in the types of ozone analysers, we studied the chemical and biological activities of ozone, which were evenly detected in the locker. The gown in the locker was also uniformly exposed to ozone. Results showed that ozone gas could be used for the on-site disinfection of PPE in a closed box, such as a locker. This finding is valuable during a pandemic when PPE is in short supply."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ishiwata", "ForeName": "Shunji", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Sakai City Medical Center, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hibino", "ForeName": "Taishi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sakashita", "ForeName": "Tomoe", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nishioka", "ForeName": "Manami", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Tomomi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Pharmaceutics and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kotake", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare the following conflict of interests: S.I. received research grants from Tamura Teco Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan.
