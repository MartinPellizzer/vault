The aim of this study is to examine both parasites in the water samples taken from three pilot-scale plant processes located in southern Taiwan, to upgrade the current facilities. Three processes include: conventional process without prechlorination (Process 1), conventional process plus ozonation and pellet softening (Process 2), and integrated membrane process (MF plus NF) followed conventional process (Process 3). The detection methods of both parasites are modified from USEPA Methods 1622 and 1623. Results indicated that coagulation, sedimentation and filtration removed the most percentage of both protozoan parasites. The pre-ozonation step can destruct both parasites, especially for Giardia cysts. The microfiltration systems can intercept Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts completely. A significant correlation between water turbidity and Cryptosporidium oocysts was found in this study. The similar results were also found between three kinds of particles (phi=3-5,5-8 and 8-10 microm) and Cryptosporidium oocysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Health, Yuanpei University of Science and Technology, 306 Yuanpei Street, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC. bmhsu@mail.yust.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "Bing Mu", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeh", "ForeName": "Hsuan Hsien", "Initials": "HH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Facility Design and Construction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Giardia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oocysts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12553986", "10.1016/s0043-1354(02)00466-9", "S0043-1354(02)00466-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
