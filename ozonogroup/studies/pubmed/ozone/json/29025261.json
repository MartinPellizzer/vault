First, we consider amperometric gas sensor technology including its development toward specifically designed air quality sensors. We then review recent academic and research organizations' studies where this technology has been trialed for air quality monitoring applications: early studies showed the potential of electrochemical gas sensors when colocated with reference Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) stations. Spatially dense networks with fast temporal resolution provide information not available from sparse AQMs with longer recording intervals. We review how this technology is being offered as commercial urban air quality networks and consider the remaining challenges. Sensors must be sensitive, selective, and stable; air quality monitors/nodes must be electronically and mechanically well designed. Data correction is required and models with differing levels of sophistication are being designed. Data analysis and validation is possibly the biggest remaining hurdle needed to deliver reliable concentration readings. Finally, this review also considers the roles of companies, urban infrastructure requirements, and public research in the development of this technology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9042-8881"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alphasense Ltd , Sensor Technology House, 300 Avenue West, Great Notley, Essex CM77 7AA, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Baron", "ForeName": "Ronan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alphasense Ltd , Sensor Technology House, 300 Avenue West, Great Notley, Essex CM77 7AA, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Saffell", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Sens", "NlmUniqueID": "101669031", "ISSNLinking": "2379-3694"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29025261", "10.1021/acssensors.7b00620"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
