Based on a cohort of 2,240 school children from 13 Southern Californian communities, cumulative lagged average regression models were fitted to determine the association between F(eNO) and ambient air pollution levels from central site monitors with lags of up to 30 days prior to F(eNO) testing. Daily 24-h cumulative lagged averages of particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 \u00b5m (PM\u2082.\u2085; over 1-8 days) and particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00b5m (PM\u2081\u2080; over 1-7 days), as well as 10:00-18:00 h cumulative lagged average of O\u2083 (over 1-23 days) were significantly associated with 17.42% (p<0.01), 9.25% (p<0.05) and 14.25% (p<0.01) higher F(eNO) levels over the interquartile range of 7.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m\u207b\u00b3, 12.97 \u03bcg\u00b7m\u207b\u00b3 and 15.42 ppb, respectively. The effects of PM\u2082.\u2085, PM\u2081\u2080 and O\u2083 were higher in the warm season. The particulate matter effects were robust to adjustments for effects of O\u2083 and temperature and did not vary by asthma or allergy status. In summary, short-term increases in PM\u2082.\u2085, PM\u2081\u2080 and O\u2083 were associated with airway inflammation independent of asthma and allergy status, with PM\u2081\u2080 effects significantly higher in the warm season."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9011, USA. kiros@usc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berhane", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linn", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rappaport", "ForeName": "E B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bastain", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salam", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lurmann", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilliland", "ForeName": "F D", "Initials": "FD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES007048", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01 ES009581", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL061768", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "5P01ES011627", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P01 ES011627", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R826708-01", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RD831861-01", "Acronym": "RD", "Agency": "ORD VA", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "5P01ES009581", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "5P30ES007048", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "5R01HL76647", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "5R01HL61768", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL076647", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Gauderman WJ, Avol E, Gilliland F, et al.
