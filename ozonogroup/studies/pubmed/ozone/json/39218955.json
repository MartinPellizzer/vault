Employing strong gluten flour (SGF) and weak gluten flour (WGF), we demonstrate that AO pretreatment significantly enhances the yield and purity of separated starch and gluten. Surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl groups, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman, and size exclusion-high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) analyses were used to evaluate the effects of AO on the molecular structure of gluten. Our analysis reveals that low concentrations of AO induce specific modifications in gluten proteins. AO treatment increases cross-linking in glutenin macropolymer (GMP), reduces surface hydrophobicity, and stabilizes secondary and tertiary structures. These changes include an increase in \u03b2-sheet content by approximately 9% and a corresponding decrease in \u03b2-turn structures, leading to enhanced viscoelastic properties of the gluten. The research highlights AO's potential as a sustainable and efficient agent in wheat flour processing, offering advancements in both product quality and eco-friendly processing techniques. Future research should optimize AO treatment parameters and explore its effects on different cereal types further to enhance its applicability and benefits in food processing. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Our work substantially advances the existing knowledge on wheat flour processing by demonstrating the multifaceted benefits of AO pretreatment. We unveil significant improvements in the yield and purity of starch and gluten when compared to conventional separation methods. Moreover, our in-depth analysis of molecular changes induced by AO, including increased cross-linking, alterations in surface hydrophobicity, and modifications in glutenin macropolymer content, provides new insights into how AO affects the viscoelastic properties of gluten. This contribution is pivotal for the development of more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly wheat flour processing technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Institute of Food Technologists."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Grain and Food, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, P.
