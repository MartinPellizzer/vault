From this period, 21 days with the highest concentrations of nitrate radical (above 220 pptv) were selected for analysis. Joint measurements with the University of Heidelberg's LP-DOAS showed good agreement (r = 0.94). For all daytime measurements, NO(3) remained below the detection limit (8.5 pptv). The highest value recorded was more than 800 pptv (July 27, 2007), twice the maximum level reported previously. For this subset of measurements, mean maximum values for the extreme events were 345 pptv (SD = 135 pptv). Concentrations rose above detection limits at sunset, peaked between midnight and early morning, and returned to zero at sunrise. These elevated concentrations of NO(3) were a consequence of several factors, including an increase in ozone concentrations parallel to a substantial decrease in relative humidity during the night; Mean nighttime NO(2) levels above 10 ppbv, which prevented a deficiency in NO(3) precursors; Negligible NO levels during the night; and a substantial decrease in the loss processes, which led to a lower degradation frequency and allowed NO(3) lifetimes to build up to a maximum mean of 25 min. The results indicate that the major sink pathway for NO(3) was direct homogeneous gas phase reactions with VOC, and a smaller indirect pathway via hydrolysis of N(2)O(5). The Jerusalem measurements were used to estimate the oxidation potential of extreme NO(3) levels at an urban location. The 24 h average potential of NO(3), OH, and O(3) to oxidize hydrocarbons was evaluated for 30 separate VOCs. NO(3) was found to be responsible for approximately 70% of the oxidation of total VOCs and nearly 75% of the olefinic VOCs; which was more than twice the VOC oxidation potential of the OH radical. These results establish the NO(3) radical as an important atmospheric oxidant in Jerusalem."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Givat Ram, Israel. davidasaf2@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asaf", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedersen", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matveev", "ForeName": "Valeri", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peleg", "ForeName": "Mordechai", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kern", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zingler", "ForeName": "Jutta", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Platt", "ForeName": "Ulrich", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luria", "ForeName": "Menachem", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Israel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20000501", "10.1021/es900798b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
