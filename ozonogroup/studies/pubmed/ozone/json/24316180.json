In this paper tertiary treatment of wastewater by the combination of ozone and soil aquifer treatment was investigated with respect to the removal of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ, 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and its transformation products. Batch tests and pilot experiments confirmed efficient removal of carbamazepine from secondary effluent by ozone. With typical ozone consumption of 0.7\u00a0mg\u00a0O3/mg\u00a0DOC0, approx. 50% of the transformed CBZ was detected as its primary product 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM). Structure proposals and a formation pathway were elaborated for a total of 13 ozonation products of CBZ. In subsequent biological treatment BQM turned out to be more effectively biodegraded than CBZ. Its aldehyde group was quickly oxidized to a carboxylic acid (BaQM), which was removed in sand column experiments. Most of the minor ozonation products of CBZ persisted in sand column experiments with residence times of 5-6 days. Non-target screening of column effluent revealed no formation of persistent biotransformation products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
