Rats were continuously exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone ( approximately 0.8 mg O(3)/m(3)) for 1, 3, 7, 28, or 56 days. Recovery from 3 days of exposure was studied at day 7, 14, and 28; recovery from 7 days of exposure was studied at day 14, 28, and 56, recovery from 28 days of exposure was studied at day 35 and 56, and recovery from 56 days of exposure was studied at day 136. The study included a correlated biochemical and morphological analysis of inflammatory responses, structural changes, and collagen content. The acute inflammatory response, as measured by an increase of polymorphonuclear cells and plasma protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, reached a maximum at day 1 and resolved largely within 6 days during ongoing exposure. Numbers of macrophages in BAL fluid increased progressively up to day 56, and slowly returned to near control levels when exposure was followed by postexposure recovery. Histological examination and morphometry of the lungs revealed centriacinar inflammatory responses throughout ozone exposure. Centriacinar thickening of septa was observed at day 7. Ductular septa, thickened progressively at days 7, 28, and 56 of exposure, showed increased collagen upon exposure at day 28, which was further enhanced at exposure at day 56. Increased collagen content in lungs, as measured biochemically by hydroxyproline concentration, was observed at exposure day 56. Collagen content was not different from control at day 56 when 7 or 28 days of exposure was followed by postexposure recovery. After continuous ozone exposure, respiratory bronchioles were present in an increasing degree, and remained present after a recovery period. The results of this study clearly show that after continuous exposure to O(3) some acute effects, such as protein and albumin content, and neutrophil influx in BAL fluid, returned to control levels within a few days. However, other parameters, such as the alveolar macrophage response and structural changes such as the presence of terminal bronchioles, thickening of ductular septa by enhanced cellularity, and collagen formation, persisted or progressively increased during continued exposure. Postexposure recovery seems to partly resolve these subchronic responses (macrophages response, septal cellularity), whereas other effects (collagen increase and respiratory bronchioles formation) do not disappear."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Health Effects Research, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, PO Box 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, The Netherlands.
