In this study, a new concept of continuous process consisting of precipitation, adsorption, and oxidation was developed without the use of chemicals. In the sedimentation step, waste oyster shell(WOS) and a PE tube diffuser(PE250) containing Na<sub>2</sub>S (PE<sub>Ca/S</sub>), PE<sub>Ca/S</sub> were prepared, which were used to precipitate heavy metals with a removal efficiency of 97% or more. In the adsorption step, fluorine (F), arsenic (As), and thorium (Th) were precipitated and removed when heavy metals were removed using coal mine drainage sludge (CMDS) and an adsorbent (PU<sub>CMDS</sub>) made of polyurethane (PU). Running a semi and pilot scale continuous process using PE<sub>Ca/S</sub>, PU<sub>CMDS</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/HC systems resulted in a semi and pilot scale operating period of 120 and 62 days, and 60.26, 797.84, 46.94, 78.62\u00a0g, and 7.120\u00a0kg and 266.35, 42556.8, 191.95, 3108.43\u00a0g and 629.84\u00a0kg for As, F, Th, Pb and CODcr has been removed respectively. In addition, the removal efficiencies of As, F, Th, Pb and CODcr were 99.75, 99.98, 93.60, 99.99, and 88.82%, respectively, when treating real RE wastewater using the pilot scale system. Without the use of agitated reactors and regulators, the new concept of continuous process can effectively treat RE real wastewater, and the quality of the process outlet has met the pollutant limits recommended by EPA and China for irrigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
