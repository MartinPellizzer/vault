However, practical application is hindered by the poor water resistance of catalysts. Herein, Ag-Hollandite (Ag-HMO) with varying Ag<sup>+</sup> content was synthesized. Catalysts with more Ag<sup>+</sup> exhibited improved efficiency and water-resistance, with the optimal one maintaining 98% O<sub>3</sub> conversion at 70% relative humidity (RH) within 8\u00a0h. Physicochemical characterizations revealed that Ag<sup>+</sup> had entered the tunnel of OMS-2, facilitating oxygen species removal. Notably, enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O desorption and the complete inhibition of chemisorbed water formation on Ag-HMO were the primary reasons for its high-efficiency O<sub>3</sub> conversion across a wide humidity range. The underlying mechanism arises from the charge redistribution induced by the Ag-O interaction within the tunnel, which reduces acidity and modulates hydrophilicity. This study aims to contribute insights for designing catalysts with higher water-resistance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
