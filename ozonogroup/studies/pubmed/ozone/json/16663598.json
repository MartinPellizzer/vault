The response surfaces derived from these equations were displayed as contour or isometric (3-dimensional) plots. The contour plots aided in the interpretation of the pollutant interactions and were judged easier to use than the isometric plots. Plants of ;Grand Rapids' lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), ;Cherry Belle' radish (Raphanus sativus L.), and ;Alsweet' pea (Pisum sativum L.) were grown in a controlled environment chamber and exposed to seven combinations of SO(2) and O(3). Injury was evaluated based on visible chlorosis and necrosis and growth was evaluated as leaf area and dry weight. Covariate measurements were used to increase precision. Radish and pea had greater injury, in general, that did lettuce; all three species were sensitive to O(3), and pea was most sensitive and radish least sensitive to SO(2). Leaf injury responses were relatively more affected by the pollutants than were plant growth responses in radish and pea but not in lettuce. In radish, hypocotyl growth was more sensitive to the pollutants than was leaf growth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormrod", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tingey", "ForeName": "D T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gumpertz", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olszyk", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Appl Physiol. 1960 May;15:383-9", "ArticleIdList": ["14427915"]}, {"Citation": "Radiat Environ Biophys. 1982;20(4):235-43", "ArticleIdList": ["7146317"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16663598", "PMC1066831", "10.1104/pp.75.1.43"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
