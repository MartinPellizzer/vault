Three consecutive panels of children participating in a summer camp in the Austrian Alps were investigated. On-site pollution assessment consisted of 24-h measurements of particulate matter < 10 microns and the hydrogen, sulfate, and ammonium ion components. The 24-h maximums of ozone and daily pollen counts were also established. For 47, 45, and 41 subjects, daily FEV1, FVC, and peak expiratory flow were recorded. Fifteen percent, 11%, and 5% of participants, respectively, reported current asthma medication, indicating a markedly increased prevalence of respiratory disease. Mean levels of ambient pollutants were approximately 15% higher for the first panel than for the other two panels, but the hydrogen ion (H+) component was twice as high for Panel 1. The maximum H+ exposure during Panel 1 was 84 nmol/m3 (4 micrograms/m3 H2SO4 equivalent). For FEV1 in Panel 1, a significant decrease of -0.99 ml per nmol/m3 H+ (p = 0.01) was observed. For Panel 2, the FEV1/H+ coefficient was found to be similar (-0.74 ml per nmol/m3 H+; p = 0.28), while for Panel 3 it was in the opposite direction (0.10 ml per nmol/m3 H+; p = 0.83). The decrease in FEV1 observed in Panel 1 was more pronounced when the mean exposure during the previous 4 d was considered (-2.99 ml FEV1 per nmol/m3 H+; p = 0.004). We conclude that summer haze acidic particles may be associated with transient decreases in lung function in children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Internal Department, Centre for Pulmonary Disease, Vienna, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Studnicka", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frischer", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meinert", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Studnicka-Benke", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hajek", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spengler", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neumann", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7YNJ3PO35Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Austria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7842201", "10.1164/ajrccm.151.2.7842201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
