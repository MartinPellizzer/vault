This review deals with the occurrence of aflatoxins in some of the major food products in the last 5\u202fyears including regulatory aspects, and recent advances in detoxification strategies for contaminated foods. Aflatoxin contamination in cereals including corn and peanut is still a public health problem for some populations, especially in African countries. Despite that most of physical and chemical methods for aflatoxin detoxification may affect the nutritional properties of food, or are not safe for human consumption, gamma-radiation and ozone applications have demonstrated great potential for detoxification of aflatoxins in some food matrices. Biological methods based on removal or degradation of aflatoxins by bacterial and yeast have good perspectives, although further studies are needed to clarify the detoxification mechanisms by microorganisms and determine practical aspects of the use of these methods in food products, especially their potential effects on sensory characteristics of foods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
