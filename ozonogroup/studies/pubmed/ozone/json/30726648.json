Rate constants for FA reaction with ozone were estimated. It was found that the constants depend on a) aliphatic chain length, b) DB number of DB in the chain, c) DB position in the chain and d) cist- or trans- configuration of FA. The highest rate constant was recorded for \u042118:1 cis-\u03c9-9 oleic FA (2.58\u2219105, \u041c-1s-1). Oxidation rate constants for other FA were 1.5- to 3-fold lower depending of the FA structure. The greatest role ozonolysis is played in biochemical reactions, in physiologic metabolism of FA and also in aphysiologic reactions of modification of FA as part of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and aminophospholipids) in structure of plasmatic membranes of living cells. We believe also that phylogenetically the role of insulin consists in: a) promoting the conversion of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals that left the ocean into herbivorous, b) providing high kinetic parameters for realization of the biological function of locomotion, c) converting in vivo the low-efficiency palmitic pathway of FA metabolism with energy deficiency into a high-efficiency oleic pathway. During phylogenesis, low chemical activity of oleic FA in vivo is the major etiological factor of two nonphysiological processes: atherosclerosis and atheromatosis which are fundamental for the development of ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "N.M.
