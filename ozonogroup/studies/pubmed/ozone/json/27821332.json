In many superoleophobic surfaces created to date, the lack of mechanical durability has been an issue. In this work, for the first time, transparent, wear-resistant, superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces were developed for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using a simple and scalable fabrication technique. PDMS is of importance in biomedical applications as it is biocompatible, chemically stable, and transparent. PDMS was made superhydrophobic either through micropatterning or an applied coating of hydrophobic SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with a binder of methylphenyl silicone resin. Through the addition of fluorination via fluorosilane, the nanoparticle/binder coating was made superoleophobic. Intermediate steps using ultraviolet-ozone treatment were required for improved deposition and adhesion of the coatings. The effects of surface treatments were examined through contact angle and tilt angle measurements. The coating was found to have re-entrant geometries desirable for superoleophobicity and to exhibit mechanical wear resistance and transparent properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
