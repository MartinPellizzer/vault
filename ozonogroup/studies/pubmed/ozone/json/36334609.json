We aimed to investigate the association between pollutant concentrations and the risk of OHCA in Singapore.", "We did a time series analysis of all cases of OHCA in Singapore reported between July 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2018, to the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS), a prospective, population-based registry. Using multivariable fractional polynomial modelling, we investigated the immediate (day 0) and lagged (up to 5 days after exposure) association between 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increases in concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 2\u00b75 \u03bcm or smaller (PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>), particulate matter with a diameter of 10 \u03bcm or smaller (PM<sub>10</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and 1 mg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and relative risk (RR) of OHCA.", "We extracted data for 18\u2008131 cases of OHCA. The median age of this cohort of cases was 65 years (IQR 56-80), 6484 (35\u00b78%) were female, 11\u2008647 (64\u00b72%) were male, 12\u2008270 (67\u00b77%) were Chinese, 2873 (15\u00b78%) were Malay, and 2010 (11\u00b71%) were Indian. Every 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> was associated with increased risk of OHCA (RR 1\u00b7022 [95% 1\u00b7002-1\u00b7043]) over the next 2 days, which decreased over the subsequent 3 days (3-5 days after exposure; 0\u00b7976 [0\u00b7955-0\u00b7998]). For PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>, we did not observe any associations between increased concentration and risk of OHCA on day 0 or cumulative risk over time (ie, at 0-1 days, 0-2 days, 0-3 days, 0-4 days, 0-5 days, and 3-5 days after exposure). For CO, we observed a cumulative decreased risk of OHCA across 0-5 days after exposure (0\u00b7876 [0\u00b7770-0\u00b7997]) and at days 3-5 after exposure (0\u00b7810 [0\u00b7690-0\u00b7949]). We observed effect modification of the association between increasing PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> concentration and OHCA 0-2 days after exposure by cardiac arrest rhythm (non-shockable 1\u00b7027 [1\u00b7004-1\u00b7050] vs shockable 1\u00b7002 [0\u00b7956-1\u00b7051]) and location of OHCA (at home: 1\u00b7033 [1\u00b7008-1\u00b7057] vs not at home 0\u00b7955 [0\u00b7957-1\u00b7035]). In hypothetical modelling, the number of OHCA events associated with PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> could be reduced by 8% with a 1 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> decrease in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> concentrations and by 30% with a 3 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> decrease in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> concentrations.", "Increases in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> concentration were associated with an initial increased risk of OHCA and a subsequent reduced risk from 3-5 days after exposure, suggesting a short-term harvesting effect. A decrease in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> concentrations could reduce population demand for emergency health services.", "National Medical Research Council, Singapore, under the Clinician Scientist Award, Singapore and the Singapore Translational Research Investigator Award (MOH-000982-01)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
