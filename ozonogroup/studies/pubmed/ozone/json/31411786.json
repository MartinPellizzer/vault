Two parallel BAC filters with identical media and influent were maintained, each at a different empty bed contact time of 10 and 20\u00a0min. This study captured the CEC removal performance of a BAC filter over an extended operational period after treating 65,000 bed volumes. Ozone system was operated at ozone dose to TOC ratio range of 0.9-2. Biofilter with lower EBCT (10\u00a0min) and exhausted media resulted in poor removals of Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), sucralose, meprobamate, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and cotinine. Biofilter with higher EBCT (20\u00a0min) and remaining adsorptive effects resulted in significant (84% or more) removal of all CECs that were detected in the ozonated effluent. Increasing both ozone dose and BAC EBCT resulted in increased removal of UV absorbance (UVA<sub>254</sub> ). The evaluation of impact of ozone:TOC ratio and BAC EBCT on CEC removal, bulk organics (TOC), and UVA<sub>254</sub> performed in this study confirmed the importance of these two parameters on overall success of nonreverse osmosis (RO) potable reuse projects. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Ozone-BAC biofiltration is feasible strategy for indirect potable reuse water reclamation. Ozone-BAC empty bed contact time is a critical design parameter. Adsorption and biodegradation are both important mechanisms for trace organic contaminant removal\u00a0in BAC."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Water Environment Federation."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sundaram", "ForeName": "Vijay", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8194-5169"], "LastName": "Pagilla", "ForeName": "Krishna", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Western Regional Water Commission", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "US Bureau of Reclamation", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Truckee Meadows Water Authority", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Washoe County", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "APHA (2017).
