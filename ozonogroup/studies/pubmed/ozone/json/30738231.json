In drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), effective removal of cyanotoxins with reduced toxicity is a primary concern. Commonly used treatments, such as ozonation, chlorination or activated carbon, undergo significant changes in their operating conditions (mainly dosage) to counter the variation in different environmental parameters, such as pH, temperature, and high cyanotoxin concentration. Presence of metal ions, natural organic matter (NOM), and other chemicals demand higher dosage and hence affect the activation energy to efficiently break down the cyanotoxin molecule. Due to these higher dose requirements, the treatment leads to the formation of toxic metabolites at a concentration high enough to break the guideline values. Biological methods of cyanotoxin removal proceed via enzymatic pathway where the protein-encoding genes are often responsible for the compound breakdown into non-toxic metabolites. However, in contrast to the chemical treatment, the biological processes advance at a much slower kinetic rate, predominantly due to a longer onset period (high lag phase). In fact, more than 90% of the studies reported on the biological degradation of the cyanotoxins attribute the biodegradation to the bacterial suspension. This suspended growth limits the mass transfer kinetics due to the presence of metal ions, NOMs and, other oxidizable matter, which further prolongs the lag phase and makes biological process toxic-free, albeit less efficient. In this context, this review attempts to bring out the importance of the attached growth mechanism, in particular, the biofilm-based treatment approaches which can enhance the biodegradation rate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
