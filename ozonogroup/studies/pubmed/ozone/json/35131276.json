Therefore, their treatments are critical. In this research, the removal and mineralization of Acid red 88 (AR88), as a widely used mono Azo dye, was inspected by the Electro-peroxone(E-peroxone) method. It is a coupling of electrochemically produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ozone that can produce robust hydroxyl radicals. The Central Composite Design (CCD) was applied to explore the influence of operational variables on the removal of AR88 as a response. The optimal conditions predicted by the CCD were as the following; Applied current at 0.7 A, pH at 7.35, O<sub>3</sub> Flowrate at 1.03\u00a0L\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup> and the concentration of AR88 at 527.29\u00a0mg. L<sup>-1</sup>. The Pareto chart showed that the concentration of AR88 has a significant influence on the response. At the predicted optimal conditions, the actual and predicted AR 88 removal were 95.4 and 92.96%, respectively. The removal of COD after 45\u00a0min was 70% representing the excessive efficiency of E-peroxone in mineralization of AR88. The E-peroxone follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics (k<sub>obs-E-peroxone</sub>\u00a0=\u00a06.56\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>), which was more remarkable than the single ozonation, and electrolysis. The calculated specific energy consumption (SEC) in the E-peroxone was 40.14\u00a0kWh/Kg AR 18 removal, which was lower than the individual ozonation, and electrolysis methods. The operative production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from O<sub>2</sub> at the cathode is the critical factor in the high removal of AR88 in this process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
