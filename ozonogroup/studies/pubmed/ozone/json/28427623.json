The aim of research article is to check the influence of geometrical parameters (total flow area, the ratio of throat perimeter to its cross-sectional area, throat shape and size, etc.) and configuration of the cavitating devices on decolorization of RB13 in aqueous solution. For this purpose, eight cavitating devices i.e. Circular and slit venturi, and six orifice plates having different flow area and perimeter were used in the present work. Initially, the effects of various operating parameters such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, operating inlet pressure and cavitation number on the decolorization of RB13 have been investigated, and the optimum operating conditions were found. Kinetic analysis revealed that the decolorization and mineralization of RB13 using HC followed first order reaction kinetics. Almost 47% decolorization of RB13 was achieved using only HC with slit venturi as a cavitating device at an optimum inlet pressure of 0.4MPa and pH of the solution as 2.0. It has been found that in case of orifice plates, higher decolorization rate of 4\u00d710<sup>-3</sup>min<sup>-1</sup> was achieved using orifice plate 2 (OP2) which is having higher flow area and perimeter (\u03b1=2.28). The effect of process intensifying agents (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulphate) and different gaseous additives (oxygen and ozone) on the extent of decolorization of RB13 were also examined. Almost 66% decolorization of RB13 was achieved using HC combined with 2Lmin<sup>-1</sup> of oxygen and in combination with ferrous sulphate (1:3). Nearly 91% decolorization was achieved using HC combined with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at an optimum molar ratio (dye:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) of 1:20 while almost complete decolorization was observed in 15min using a combination of HC and ozone at 3gh<sup>-1</sup> ozone feed rate. Maximum 72% TOC was removed using HC coupled with 3gh<sup>-1</sup> ozone feed rate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
