The effects are reflected in changes in the flavonoid contents, the antioxidant activity of the phenolic compound fraction and the enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism. The investigations were carried out on a hot pepper fruit cultivar, Cyklon. It was found that the levels of a majority of flavonoids, in particular those of quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-glucoside increased in the pericarp of fruits treated with ozone for 3h and stored for 20days (by 25% relative to the control). Simultaneously, reduced phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and tyrosine ammonia-lyase activity were noted, which implies slight degradation of enzymes caused by the ozone treatment and enhancement of the polyphenol oxidase and guaiacol oxidase activity involved in response to increased oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
