Similarto the Rct concept used to describe OH radical exposure per ozone dose, the ROH,UV concept is defined as the experimentally determined *OH radical exposure per UV fluence. ROH,UV was determined by examining the destruction of a probe compound, para-chlorobenzoic acid in four different waters: DI water and three natural waters. ROH,UV was found to be affected greatly by water quality, specifically background *OH radical scavenging, which competed forthe formed *OH radical with the probe compound, and background UV absorbance, which screened UV irradiation from the hydrogen peroxide. The ROH,UV values determined in the experiments using low-pressure Hg lamp were greater than those for the medium-pressure Hg lamp . Finally, the ROH,UV concept was utilized to calculate an overall scavenging factor for each water matrix, and this was successfully utilized in conjunction with the steady-state *OH radical model to improve the prediction of the oxidation of endocrine-disrupting compounds 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol and 17-beta-estradiol in the natural waters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Duke University, Box 90287, Durham, North Carolina 27708-0287, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenfeld", "ForeName": "Erik J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linden", "ForeName": "Karl G", "Initials": "KG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IC7888DF4L", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorobenzoic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17438814", "10.1021/es062353p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
