The influence of meteorological elements such as daily maximum temperature (<i>T</i><sub>max</sub>), daily average ground pressure (<i>p</i>), daily average ground relative humidity (RH), and daily average ground wind speed (<i>v</i>) on ozone concentration[<i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h)] and the exceeding standard rate of O<sub>3</sub>-8h were discussed. The AQI, ozone concentration range, and ozone pollution level forecast accuracy rates were evaluated using the neural network statistical model. The results showed that the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>-8h-90per[<i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h-90per)] of 13 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2016 to 2020 were 157.4, 177.2, 177.3, 190.6, and 175.6 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The regional ozone concentration increased by 11.6% over the five years from 2016 to 2019. From 2016 to 2019, there was an overall upward trend in volatility, followed by a decline in 2020. Compared with that in 2016, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-8h-90per in the other 10 cities increased by 6-45.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, except for in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde, where it decreased slightly. The average value of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) from April to September was higher than 100 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the highest monthly average concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-8h was 158.10 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in June. The range of the over standard rate of O<sub>3</sub>-8h was 8.6%-19.2% in the 13 cities, and 97.8% of ozone concentrations exceeded the standard in the period from April to September. At the regional scale, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-8h had the strongest correlation with the daily maximum temperature. Furthermore, when <i>T</i><sub>max</sub> was in the range of 25-28\u2103, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-8h in the 13 cities began to exceed the standard concentration of 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Additionally, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-8h negatively correlated with <i>p</i>. When RH was below 60%, ozone concentration increased slowly with relative humidity in most cities. When RH was above 61%-70%, ozone concentration decreased with the increase in daily relative humidity in most cities. When ozone exceeded the standard concentration of 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, the dominant wind was mainly southerly wind, and the high ozone concentration in most cities tended to be concentrated in the low wind speed range of 2-3 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> and below. Moreover, the correlation coefficient range of the statistical model of OPAQ 1-9 days in advance was 0.72-0.86, the average accuracy of AQI level forecasts was 67%-86%, and the average accuracy of O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration forecasts was 63%-84%. In April to September, when ozone exceeded the standard of 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, the accuracy rates of the model forecast of light ozone pollution and ozone exceeding the standard concentration of 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>three days in advance were 69% and 66%, which can provide a reference for the management and control of ozone pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Meteorological Center, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Gui", "ForeName": "Hai-Lin", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-Jun", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Center, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beijing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35971695", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202111145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
