Catalytic ozonation technology, which involves production of \u00b7OH radical with strong oxidation ability, is widely used in the treatment of organic-containing wastewater. In this work, MgO-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> composite metal oxide catalysts prepared with different fabrication conditions have been systematically evaluated and compared in the catalytic ozonation of ammonia (50mg/L) in water. In terms of high catalytic activity in ammonia decomposition and high selectivity for gaseous nitrogen, the catalyst with MgO-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> molar ratio 8:2, calcined at 500\u00b0C for 3hr, was the best one among the catalysts we tested, with an ammonia nitrogen removal rate of 85.2% and gaseous nitrogen selectivity of 44.8%. In addition, the reaction mechanism of ozonation oxidative decomposition of ammonia nitrogen in water with the metal oxide catalysts was discussed. Moreover, the effect of coexisting anions on the degradation of ammonia was studied, finding that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> could inhibit the catalytic activity while CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Br<sup>-</sup> could promote it. The presence of coexisting cations had very little effect on the catalytic ozonation of ammonia nitrogen. After five successive reuses, the catalyst remained stable in the catalytic ozonation of ammonia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
