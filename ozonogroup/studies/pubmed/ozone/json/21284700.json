Blood samples were collected at fixed time intervals for 24h. Patients were given 12 sessions of rectal ozone of 300ml of 40% ozone/oxygen mixture. On day 14 another oral dose of 80mg propranolol was given and blood samples were collected as on day 1. Plasma concentrations of propranolol were measured by HPLC. Portal vein oxygen tension and saturation were measured before and after rectal ozone.", "Plasma concentrations of propranolol were reduced after ozone therapy with pronounced decreases in the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. The changes were consistent with a decrease in propranolol bioavailability. There was a decrease in the elimination half-life and mean residence time. Portal vein oxygenation significantly increased after rectal ozone.", "The changes in the pharmacokinetics of propranolol probably reflect an increase in the rate and extent of its metabolism resulting from improved portal vein oxygenation attributable to the ozone therapy. The present work highlights that ozone can be an alternative medical measure to improve portal vein oxygenation in liver cirrhosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2011 The Authors.
