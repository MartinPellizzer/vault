The therapeutic effects were evaluated using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores and the average doses of gabapentin (mg/d) preoperatively and 1 day, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively. The incidence of clinically significant postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and complications in the 2 groups were recorded.", "The data showed that the NRS scores and the doses of gabapentin after treatment were significantly lower when compared with the baseline values in both groups. Compared with group B, the NRS scores and the doses of postoperative gabapentin were significantly lower in group A. The incidence of PHN was significantly lower at weeks 4, 12, and 24 in group A than in group B. No adverse reactions occurred in either of the 2 groups post-treatment.", "The results indicated that ozone injection in the dorsal root ganglion combined with pulsed radiofrequency therapy was more effective in treating acute HZ neuralgia in middle-aged and elderly adults. It provides patients with longer-lasting pain relief, decreased incidence of PHN and the doses of medication, and improved quality of life than with Pulsed Radiofrequency treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
