We applied an over-dispersed generalized additive Poisson model (GAM) with adjustment for temporal trends, seasonal variations, weather conditions, and calendar effects to compute the effect estimate for each city. Then we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the eight city-specific effect estimates to obtain the overall associations of NMHC exposure on lag0 day with hospital admissions for respiratory and circulatory diseases, respectively.", "On average, a 0.1-ppm increase of lag0 NMHC demonstrated an overall 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4-1.3%) and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4-1.2%) increment of hospital admissions for respiratory and circulatory diseases, respectively. Further analyses with adjustment for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the multi-pollutant model or sensitivity analyses with restricting the NMHC monitoring from the general stations only confirmed the robustness of the association between ambient NMHC exposure and cardiorespiratory hospitalizations.", "Our findings provide robust evidence of higher cardiorespiratory hospitalizations in association with acute exposure to ambient NMHC in eight major cities of Taiwan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
