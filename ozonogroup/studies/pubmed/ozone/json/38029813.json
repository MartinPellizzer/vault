Short-term increases in air pollution have been associated with increased risk of CVD event, though relatively few studies have directly compared effects of multiple pollutants using fine-scale spatio-temporal data, thoroughly adjusting for co-pollutants and temperature, in an exhaustive citywide hospitals dataset, towards identifying key pollution sources within the urban environment to most reduce, and reduce disparities in, the leading cause of death worldwide.", "We aimed to examine multiple pollutants against multiple CVD diagnoses, across lag days, in models adjusted for co-pollutants and meteorology, and inherently adjusted by design for non-time-varying individual and aggregate-level covariates, using fine-scale space-time exposure estimates, in an exhaustive dataset of emergency department visits and hospitalizations across an entire city, thereby capturing the full population-at-risk.", "We used conditional logistic regression in a case-crossover design - inherently controlling for all confounders not varying within case month - to examine associations between spatio-temporal nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in New York City, 2005-2011, on individual risk of acute CVD event (n\u00a0=\u00a0837,523), by sub-diagnosis [ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), stroke, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction].", "We found significant same-day associations between NO<sub>2</sub> and risk of overall CVD, IHD, and HF - and between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and overall CVD or HF event risk - robust to all adjustments and multiple comparisons. Results were comparable by sex and race - though median age at CVD was 10 years younger for Black New Yorkers than White New Yorkers. Associations for NO<sub>2</sub> were comparable for adults younger or older than 69 years, though PM<sub>2.5</sub> associations were stronger among older adults.", "Our results indicate immediate, robust effects of combustion-related pollution on CVD risk, by sub-diagnosis. Though acute impacts differed minimally by age, sex, or race, the much younger age-at-event for Black New Yorkers calls attention to cumulative social susceptibility."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
