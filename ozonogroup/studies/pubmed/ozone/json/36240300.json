Treating the organic pollutants in this wastewater is very challenging. The toxic substances in this wastewater make traditional biotechnological treatments inefficient. Current wastewater treatment studies are based on unit processes, and no full process studies could be found. This study used the micro-nanometer catalytic ozonation process as a pretreatment unit, and reverse osmosis membrane treatment as a depth processing unit to improve the effect of the coking wastewater degradation. The micro-nanometer catalytic ozonation pretreatment greatly improves the biodegradability of the coking wastewater and promotes the coking wastewater degradation in the anoxia/anaerobic/oxic (A/A/O) system. The integrated coagulation air flotation-micro-nanometer catalytic ozonation-A/A/O-reverse osmosis membrane system can remove 98% of the chemical oxygen demand, which meets the direct emission standard of the new national standard (China). The dominant genera in the A/A/O biochemical reactor were Thioalkalimicrobium, Proteiniphilum, Azoarcu, Bacillus, Fontibacter, and Taibaiella. This work provides a novel approach for the degradation of high-concentration organic wastewater and lays a solid foundation for the restoration of environmental water bodies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China E-mail: xiejianping@csu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ningning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China E-mail: xiejianping@csu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guozhen", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China E-mail: xiejianping@csu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Xinke", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China E-mail: xiejianping@csu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China E-mail: xiejianping@csu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Haiyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China E-mail: xiejianping@csu.edu.cn; Key Laboratory of Biometallurgy, Ministry of Education, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coke"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36240300", "10.2166/wst.2022.292"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
