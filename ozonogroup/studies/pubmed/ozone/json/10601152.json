At all experimental conditions, <5% of inspired Cl(2) penetrated beyond the upper airways and none reached the respiratory air spaces. On the other hand, larger penetrations of O(3) beyond the upper airways occurred as flow increased and during nasal than during oral breathing. In the extreme case of oral breathing at 1,000 ml/s, 35% of inhaled O(3) penetrated beyond the upper airways and approximately 10% reached the respiratory air spaces. Mass transfer theory indicated that the diffusion resistance of the tissue phase was negligible for Cl(2) but important for O(3). The gas phase resistances were the same for Cl(2) and O(3) and were directly correlated with the volume of the nose and mouth during nasal and oral breathing, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomolecular Transport Dynamics Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nodelman", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES06075", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "M01RR10732", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10601152", "10.1152/jappl.1999.87.6.2073"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
