The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.", "Fifteen studies involving 2597 patients in total were included. Patients in the control groups received different treatments, from oral drugs to other injections, instrumental therapy and even surgery: corticosteroids were used in 5 studies, analgesic therapy in 2 studies; placebo, microdiscectomy, laser-therapy, TENS and postural rehabilitation, percutaneous radiofrequency intradiscal thermocoagulation and psoas compartmental block were tested in the other trials. Looking at the quality of the literature, none of the studies included reached \"good quality\" standard, 3 were ranked as \"fair\" and the rest were considered \"poor\". Comparison of OOT results with other approaches showed that, in the majority of studies, OOT was superior to the control treatment, and also when compared to microdiscectomy, ozone showed non inferiority in terms of clinical outcomes.", "The analysis of literature revealed overall poor methodologic quality, with most studies flawed by relevant bias. However, OOT has proven to be a safe treatment with beneficial effects in pain control and functional recovery at short to medium term follow-up."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy. giulia.leonardi@polime.it."}], "LastName": "Sconza", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Leonardi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kon", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Respizzi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Massazza", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marcacci", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Di Matteo", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9717360", "ISSNLinking": "1128-3602"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34661263", "10.26355/eurrev_202110_26881", "26881"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
