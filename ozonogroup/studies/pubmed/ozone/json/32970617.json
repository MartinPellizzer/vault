Conventional treatment systems may not be effective for the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and the fate of these chemicals should be carefully monitored in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Additional treatment methods such as advanced oxidation processes can be used for the removal of endocrine disruptors. This study presents the existence of endocrine disruptors in 4 different effluents: (i) municipal WWTP effluent, (ii) textile industry WWTP effluent, (iii) organized industrial zone (OIZ) WWTP effluent and (iv) pharmaceutical industry discharge and also presents their removal efficiencies by ozonation and peroxone oxidation. A broad spectrum of removal efficiencies was observed for the EDCs present in the samples since the oxidation efficiency of wastewaters containing EDCs mainly depends on the wastewater matrix and on the type of the EDCs. Ozonation was found to be a lower-cost option than peroxone oxidation at the investigated conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil Engineering Faculty, Environmental Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey E-mail: tolmez@itu.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Olmez-Hanci", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil Engineering Faculty, Environmental Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey E-mail: tolmez@itu.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Dogruel", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITUNOVA Technology Inc., Istanbul Technical University, Ayazaga Campus, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Emek", "ForeName": "A D Allar", "Initials": "ADA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITUNOVA Technology Inc., Istanbul Technical University, Ayazaga Campus, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Y\u0131lmazer", "ForeName": "C Eropak", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITUNOVA Technology Inc., Istanbul Technical University, Ayazaga Campus, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7\u0131nar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITUNOVA Technology Inc., Istanbul Technical University, Ayazaga Campus, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kiraz", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ITUNOVA Technology Inc., Istanbul Technical University, Ayazaga Campus, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Citil", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Directorate of Water Management, Republic of Turkey Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 06560, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Orhon", "ForeName": "A Koc", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Directorate of Water Management, Republic of Turkey Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 06560, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Siltu", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Directorate of Water Management, Republic of Turkey Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 06560, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Gucver", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil Engineering Faculty, Environmental Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey E-mail: tolmez@itu.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Ozgun", "ForeName": "O Karahan", "Initials": "OK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil Engineering Faculty, Environmental Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, 34469, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey E-mail: tolmez@itu.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Tanik", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University, 06800 \u00c7ankaya, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yetis", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32970617", "10.2166/wst.2020.339"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
