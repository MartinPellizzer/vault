We conducted a weight-of-evidence (WoE) analysis to assess whether it supports a causal relationship using a novel WoE framework adapted from the US EPA's National Ambient Air Quality Standards causality framework. Specifically, we synthesized and critically evaluated the relevant epidemiology, controlled human exposure, and experimental animal data and made a causal determination using the same categories proposed by the Institute of Medicine report Improving the Presumptive Disability Decision-making Process for Veterans ( IOM 2008). We found that the totality of the data indicates that the results for CV effects are largely null across human and experimental animal studies. The few statistically significant associations reported in epidemiology studies of CV morbidity and mortality are very small in magnitude and likely attributable to confounding, bias, or chance. In experimental animal studies, the reported statistically significant effects at high exposures are not observed at lower exposures and thus not likely relevant to current ambient ozone exposures in humans. The available data also do not support a biologically plausible mechanism for CV effects of ozone. Overall, the current WoE provides no convincing case for a causal relationship between short-term exposure to ambient ozone and adverse effects on the CV system in humans, but the limitations of the available studies preclude definitive conclusions regarding a lack of causation. Thus, we categorize the strength of evidence for a causal relationship between short-term exposure to ozone and CV effects as \"below equipoise.\""]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gradient , Cambridge, MA , USA."}], "LastName": "Goodman", "ForeName": "Julie E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prueitt", "ForeName": "Robyn L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sax", "ForeName": "Sonja N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Heather N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lemay", "ForeName": "Julie C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "King", "ForeName": "Joseph M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Venditti", "ForeName": "Ferdinand J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914275", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8444"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology", "etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection Bias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25257961", "10.3109/10408444.2014.937854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
