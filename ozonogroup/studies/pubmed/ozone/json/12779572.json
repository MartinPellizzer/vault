Our aims differ from those in the existing work in that we address the role of transient chaos versus sustained chaos and, more importantly, we investigate the influence of noise. We find that noise can significantly enhance the chemical reaction in a resonancelike manner where the product of the reaction becomes maximum at some optimal noise level. We also argue that chaos may not be a necessary condition for the observed resonances. A physical theory is formulated to understand the resonant behavior.
