With concentrations ranging from nanograms per liter to \u03bcg/L, 6-PPDQ has so far been identified in a series of water samples. Acute lethality of 6-PPDQ in coho salmon (LC<sub>50</sub> < 1 \u03bcg/L) was lower than environmental concentrations of 6-PPDQ, highlighting the environment exposure risks of 6-PPDQ. It is becoming increasingly necessary to investigate the potential toxicity of 6-PPDQ at environmental concentrations. Here, we examined the effect of 6-PPDQ exposure on lifespan and healthspan and the underlying mechanism in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Exposure to 6-PPDQ (1 and 10 \u03bcg/L) shortened the lifespan. Meanwhile, during the aging process, 6-PPDQ (0.1-10 \u03bcg/L) could decrease both pumping rate and locomotion behavior, suggesting the 6-PPDQ toxicity on healthspan. For the underlying molecular mechanism, the dysregulation in the insulin signaling pathway was linked to toxicity of 6-PPDQ on lifespan and healthspan. In the insulin signaling pathway, DAF-2 restricted the function of DAF-16 to activate downstream targets (SOD-3 and HSP-6), which in turn controlled the toxicity of 6-PPDQ on lifespan and healthspan. Additionally, in response to 6-PPDQ toxicity, insulin peptides (INS-6, INS-7, and DAF-28) could activate the corresponding receptor DAF-2. Therefore, exposure to 6-PPDQ at environmentally relevant concentrations potentially causes damage to both lifespan and healthspan by activating insulin signaling in organisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of Ministry of Education, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4656-7427"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of Ministry of Education, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dayong", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylenediamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "DAF-2 protein, C elegans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor, Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylenediamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptor, Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37938123", "10.1021/acs.est.3c05325"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
