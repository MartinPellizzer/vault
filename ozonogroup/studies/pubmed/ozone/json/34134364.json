The variation pattern in Los Angeles was markedly different, with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone decreasing together over past decades. In this study, we utilize observation-based methods to establish the parametric relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and key aerosol physical properties (including aerosol optical depth and aerosol surface concentration), and an observation-based 1-D photochemical model to quantify the response of PM<sub>2.5</sub> decline in enhancing ground-level ozone pollution over a large PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration range (10-120 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>). We find that the significance of ozone enhancement due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> dropping depends on both the PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and optical properties of particles. Ozone formation increased by 37% in 2006-2016 due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> dropping in Beijing, while it becomes less important (7%) as PM<sub>2.5</sub> reaches below 40 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, similar to Los Angeles since 1980s. Therefore, the two cities show the convergence of air pollutant characteristics. Hence a control strategy prioritizing reactive volatile organic compound abatement is projected to yield simultaneous ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> reductions in Beijing, as experienced in Los Angeles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
