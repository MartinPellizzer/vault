The sensors, used for the detection of ozone near the 254-nm peak of the Hartley absorption band, were fabricated from coiled segments of low-cost multimode plastic-clad silica optical fibers. The sensing sections were produced alternatively by stripping only the protective jacket from the fiber to expose the gas-permeable silicone cladding or by stripping the jacket and the cladding to expose the bare-silica fiber core. Response characteristics are given, including sensitivity to ozone, reversibility, and aging effects. The useful lifetime was unacceptably short for the sensor that employed the bare-silica core, whereas the exposed-cladding sensor demonstrated good stability over the entire two-month period of investigation. The latter, more useful sensor demonstrated a linear response to ozone over the range 0.02-0.35 vol% and a reversible response with a time constant on the order of 1 min. Differences in ozone absorption spectra obtained in the transmission and evanescent-wave modes are discussed. Projected applications of the new exposed-cladding sensor include ozone determination in water-treatment processes and ozone production plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Potyrailo", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hobbs", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hieftje", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM 53560", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z4152N8IUI", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fiber Optic Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Fibers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9569770", "10.1021/ac970942v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
