The change of solar spectrum UV-B radiation will cause damage to all kinds of terrestrial plants at certain degree. In this paper, taking breeding sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.Moench))variety Longza No.5 as sample, 40 \u03bcW\u00b7cm-2 UV-B radiation treatment was conducted on sorghum seedlings at two-leaf and one-heart stage and different time courses; then after a 2 d recovering, photosynthetic parameters were measured with a photosynthetic apparatus; the activities of antioxidant enzymes were detected as well. Our results revealed that, as the dosages of UV-B increasing, leaf browning injury was aggravated, plants dwarfing and significantly were reduced fresh weight and dry weight were observed; anthocyanin content was significantly increased; chlorophyll and carotenoid content significantly were reduced and net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were decreased. Meanwhile, with the increase in UV-B dosages, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration and transpiration rate showed \u201cdown - up - down\u201d trend; the activities of SOD and GR presented \u201cdown - up\u201d changes; activities of POD and CAT demonstrated \u201cdown - up - down\u201d, and APX, GPX showed an \u201cup - down - up\u201d pattern. It is worth to note that, under the four-dose treatment, a sharp decline in net photosynthesis in sorghum seedlings was observed at 6 h UV-B treatment (equals to 2.4 J\u00b7m-2), and an obvious turning point was also found for other photosynthetic parameters and activities of antioxidant enzymes at the same time point. In summary, the results indicated that the enhanced UV-B radiation directly accounted for the damages in photosynthesis system including photosynthetic pigment content, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of sorghum; the antioxidant system showed different responses to UV-B radiation below or above 6 h treatment: ASA-GSH cycle was more sensitive to low-dose UV-B radiation, while high-dose UV-B radiation not only undermined the photosynthesis system, but also triggered plant enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, resulting in leaf browning and necrosis,biomass accumulation reduction, plant dwarfing and even death."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xin-xin", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zuo=tong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ke-jun", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chang-jiang", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rong-bin", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Gao-bo", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Shou-guang", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jing-yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yan-mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Li-feng", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Bo-wen", "Initials": "BW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sorghum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30001012"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
