Data of daily concentration of air pollutants, weather conditions, and selective airborne allergens were collected and compared with the number of ER visits of asthmatic children.", "1076 asthmatic children (aged 1 to 18 years) who presented at the Pediatric ER between January 1 and December 31, 1993.", "Correlations between fluctuations in ER visits of asthmatic children and various environmental parameters were more relevant for weekly than for daily values. Emergency room visits correlated positively with concentrations of NOx, SO2 and with high barometric pressure; and negatively with O3 concentration and minimal and maximal temperature. There were no significant correlations with concentrations of particulates, humidity, or airborne pollen and spores. An exceptionally high incidence of ER visits of asthmatic children was observed during September. This peak coincided with the beginning of the school year and the Jewish holidays. The correlations between ER visits and the environmental factors increased significantly when the September peak was excluded, revealing that 61% of the variance in ER visits was explained by NOx, SO2, and 03 concentrations, 46% by weather parameters, 66% by NOx, SO2 and barometric pressure, and 69% by the combination of air pollutants and weather parameters.", "The major factors found to be associated with ER visits of asthmatic children were high NOx, high SO2, and high barometric pressure. Negative correlation was found between ER visits of asthmatic children and ozone concentrations. The particularly high number of ER visits at the beginning of the school year and the Jewish holidays was probably associated with an increase in the number of viral infections and/or emotional stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kipper Institute of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tiqva."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garty", "ForeName": "B Z", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kosman", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ganor", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berger", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garty", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wietzen", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waisman", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mimouni", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waisel", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Israel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9892028", "10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62707-X", "S1081-1206(10)62707-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
