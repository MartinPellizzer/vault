The air pollution dosage during exercise is much higher than during rest because of a higher ventilatory rate and both nasal and oral breathing in the former case. For example, sulfur dioxide, which is a highly water-soluble gas, is almost entirely absorbed in the upper respiratory tract during nasal breathing. However, with oral pharyngeal breathing, the amount of sulfur dioxide that is absorbed is significantly less, and with exercise and oral pharyngeal breathing a significant decrease in upper airway absorption occurs, resulting in a significantly larger dosage of this pollutant being delivered to the tracheobronchial tree. Recently, several controlled human studies have shown that the combination of exercise and pollutant exposure (SO2 or O3) caused a marked bronchoconstriction and reduced ventilatory flow when compared to pollution exposure at rest. In a situation like the Olympic Games where milliseconds and millimeters often determine the success of athletes, air pollution can be an important factor in affecting their performance. This paper examines possible impacts of air pollution on athletic competition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierson", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Covert", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koenig", "ForeName": "J Q", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Namekata", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci Sports Exerc", "NlmUniqueID": "8005433", "ISSNLinking": "0195-9131"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C137DTR5RG", "NameOfSubstance": "Theophylline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q2WXR1I0PK", "NameOfSubstance": "Cromolyn Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QF8SVZ843E", "NameOfSubstance": "Albuterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Albuterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma, Exercise-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cromolyn Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Premedication"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sports"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Theophylline"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3088377", "10.1249/00005768-198606000-00012"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
