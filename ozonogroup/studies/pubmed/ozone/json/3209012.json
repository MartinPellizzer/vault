Separate groups of mice were infected with influenza following each of the individual exposures. A twofold increase in the incidence of mortality and a 3-day decrease in mean survival time were observed in mice infected after the second exposure. There were no effects on percentage mortality or mean survival time due to exposure to 1 ppm O3 in mice infected after the first, third, fourth, or fifth exposure. When the exposure concentration was lowered to 0.5 ppm, there were no effects on mortality in mice infected after the second exposure. Five, daily, 3-hr exposures to 1 ppm O3 had no effect on virus titers in the lungs of mice infected after either the second or fifth exposure. In contrast, wet lung weights were significantly enhanced over infected air controls in mice infected after the second O3 exposure at both 1 and 0.5 ppm but not at 0.25 ppm exposure concentrations. This effect on lung wet weight was observed in mice infected with a dose of virus which produced 7-33% mortality in controls as well as in mice infected with a sublethal dose of virus. Histopathologic changes due to sublethal influenza infection, including nonsuppurative pneumonitis and necrosis, squamous metaplasia and hyperplasia of the epithelium lining the bronchi and bronchioles, were more severe in mice infected after the second of five, 1 ppm O3 exposure than in comparable air controls. Sublethal infection caused a loss of lung volume with secondary reduction in diffusing capability and homogenity of ventilation distribution. These latter two effects were also exacerbated in mice infected after the second of five, 1 ppm O3 exposures as compared to air controls. When mice were infected after the fifth, 1 ppm O3 exposure, there was no effect due to ozone on either lung wet weight or histopathology. The data indicate that O3 has little if any effect on antiviral defense mechanisms since virus titers in the lungs were not affected by O3 exposure. However, mortality and morbidity, as indicated by lung wet weights, histopathology, and pulmonary function changes, were enhanced by O3 exposure in mice infected after the second of five exposures suggesting that symptoms due to infection can be enhanced in the absence of enhanced virus replication, possibly due to synergistic effects of O3 and virus in production of lung pathology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inhalation Toxicology Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selgrade", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Illing", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Starnes", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stead", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00e9nache", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8200838", "ISSNLinking": "0272-0590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Susceptibility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Orthomyxoviridae Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3209012", "10.1016/0272-0590(88)90280-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
