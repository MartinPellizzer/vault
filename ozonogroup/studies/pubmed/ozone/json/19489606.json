Starch in dry powder form was exposed to ozone for 10 min at different ozone generation times (OGTs). Carboxyl and carbonyl contents increased markedly in all starches with increasing OGTs. Oxidation significantly decreased the swelling power of oxidized sago and tapioca starches but increased that of oxidized corn starch. The solubility of tapioca starch decreased and sago starch increased after oxidation. However, there was an insignificant changed in the solubility of oxidized corn starch. Intrinsic viscosity [eta] of all oxidized starches decreased significantly, except for tapioca starch oxidized at 5 min OGT. Pasting properties of the oxidized starches followed different trends as OGTs increased. These results show that under similar conditions of ozone treatment, the extent of starch oxidation varies among different types of starch."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Biopolymer Research Group, Food Technology Division, School of Industrial Technology, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Minden, Penang, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Hui T", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhat", "ForeName": "Rajeev", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karim", "ForeName": "Alias A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manihot"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19489606", "10.1021/jf9008789"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
