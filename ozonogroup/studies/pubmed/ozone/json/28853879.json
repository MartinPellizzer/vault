Direct CI measurement techniques are inevitably needed for reliable assessment of CIs' role in atmospheric processes. We found that CIs from ozonolysis reactions can be directly probed by means of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with a detection limit of about 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>. Results from quantum chemical calculations support the experimental findings. The simplest CI, CH<sub>2</sub>OO, is detectable as an adduct with protonated ethers, preferably with protonated tetrahydrofuran. Kinetic measurements yielded k(CH<sub>2</sub>OO + SO<sub>2</sub>) = (3.3 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup> and k(CH<sub>2</sub>OO + acetic acid) = (1.25 \u00b1 0.30) \u00d7 10<sup>-10</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 295 \u00b1 2 K, in very good agreement with recent measurements using diiodomethane photolysis for CH<sub>2</sub>OO generation. CIs from the ozonolysis of cyclohexene, acting as surrogate for cyclic terpenes, are followed as protonated species (CI)H<sup>+</sup> using protonated amines as reagent ions. Kinetic investigations indicate a different reactivity of cyclohexene-derived CIs compared with that of simple CIs, such as CH<sub>2</sub>OO. It is supposed that the aldehyde group significantly influences the CI reactivity of the cyclohexene-derived CIs. The direct CI detection method presented here should allow study of the formation and reactivity of a wide range of different CIs formed from atmospheric ozonolysis reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2014-6018"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz-Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Berndt", "ForeName": "Torsten", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7044-2101"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz-Institute for Tropospheric Research, TROPOS , 04318 Leipzig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Herrmann", "ForeName": "Hartmut", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6416-4931"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki , 00014 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Kurt\u00e9n", "ForeName": "Theo", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28853879", "10.1021/jacs.7b05849"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
