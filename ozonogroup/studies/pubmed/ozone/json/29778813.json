The adsorption process is dependent on transport of VOCs in the air. In polluted atmospheres, the VOCs may be degraded and adsorption impeded. We studied the effect of elevated ozone regimes on the adsorption of R.\u00a0tomentosum volatiles to white cabbage, Brassica oleracea, and the oviposition of the specialist herbivore Plutella xylostella on the exposed plants. We found evidence for adsorption and re-emission of R.\u00a0tomentosum volatiles by B.\u00a0oleracea plants. Ozone changed the blend of R.\u00a0tomentosum volatiles and reduced the amount of R.\u00a0tomentosum volatiles recovered from B.\u00a0oleracea plants. However, plants exposed to R.\u00a0tomentosum volatiles received fewer P.\u00a0xylostella eggs than control plants exposed to filtered air irrespective of whether R.\u00a0tomentosum volatiles mixed with ozone. Ozone disrupts a volatile mediated passive plant-to-plant interaction by degrading some compounds and reducing the quantity available for adsorption by neighbouring plants. The change, however, did not affect the deterrence of oviposition by P.\u00a0xylostella, suggesting that aromatic companion plants of Brassica crops may confer pest-deterring properties even in ozone-polluted environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.
