Exposure to O<sub>3</sub> correlates with higher pulmonary and cardiovascular mortality and affects reproductive health and the central nervous system acutely and chronically. Skin might be a\u00a0potentially overlooked target organ of ambient O<sub>3</sub>. The experimental evidence suggests a\u00a0positive correlation of O<sub>3</sub> exposure with oxidative damage, impaired antioxidant defence and proinflammatory response in the skin. In time series studies it was observed that acute rises in O<sub>3</sub> levels correlated with seeking medical help for skin conditions; however, whether these findings are specific to O<sub>3</sub>, is not yet clear. There is preliminary epidemiological evidence that long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> is associated with premature skin aging. This finding was independent of co-exposure to other environmental factors affecting skin (e.g. ultraviolet radiation and air pollution). As concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> are rising in many regions of the world, adverse cutaneous effects of O<sub>3</sub> present a\u00a0relevant public health concern."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuks", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant for Human Health Institute, NC Research Campus, North Carolina State University, 600 Laureate Way, 28081, Kannapolis, NC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodby", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant for Human Health Institute, NC Research Campus, North Carolina State University, 600 Laureate Way, 28081, Kannapolis, NC, USA. gvalacc@ncsu.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. gvalacc@ncsu.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Hautsch\u00e4den durch troposph\u00e4risches Ozon."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Hautarzt", "NlmUniqueID": "0372755", "ISSNLinking": "0017-8470"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["30659334", "10.1007/s00105-018-4319-y", "10.1007/s00105-018-4319-y"]}}]}
