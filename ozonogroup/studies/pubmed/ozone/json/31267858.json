Improvement in this process is necessary to effectively treat several pathologies characterized by a chronic delayed wound closure, such as in diabetes, and the investigation of new approaches aimed to ameliorate the wound healing process is under continuous evolution. Recently, the usage of vegetable matrices in the form of ozonated oils has been proposed, and several researchers have shown positive effects on wound healing, due to the bactericidal, antiviral, and antifungal properties of these ozonated oils. In the present review, we intend to summarize the actual state of the art of the topical usage of ozonated oil in cutaneous wounds with special emphasis to the importance of the ozonated degree of the oil."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Yunsook", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Heaji", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant for Human Health Institute, Kannapolis Research Center, North Carolina State University, 28081, NC, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodby", "ForeName": "Brittany", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant for Human Health Institute, Kannapolis Research Center, North Carolina State University, 28081, NC, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Specialist Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara 44121, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31267858", "10.2174/1381612825666190702100504", "CPD-EPUB-99335"]}}]}
