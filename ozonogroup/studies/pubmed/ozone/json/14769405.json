The mechanism(s) by which these parasites cause gastrointestinal distress in their hosts is not well understood. The risk of waterborne transmission of Cryptosporidium is a serious global issue in drinking water safety. Oocysts from these organisms are extremely robust, prevalent in source water supplies and capable of surviving in the environment for extended periods of time. Resistance to conventional water treatment by chlorination, lack of correlation with biological indicator microorganisms and the absence of adequate methods to detect the presence of infectious oocysts necessitates the development of consistent and effective means of parasite removal from the water supply. Additional research into improving water treatment and sewage treatment practices is needed, particularly in testing the efficiency of ozone in oocyst inactivation. Timely and efficient detection of infectious C. parvum and C. hominis oocysts in environmental samples requires the development of rapid and sensitive techniques for the concentration, purification and detection of these parasites. A major factor confounding proper detection remains the inability to adequately and efficiently concentrate oocysts from environmental samples, while limiting the presence of extraneous materials. Molecular-based techniques are the most promising methods for the sensitive and accurate detection of C. parvum and C. hominis. With the availability of numerous target sequences, RT-PCR will likely emerge as an important method to assess oocyst viability. In addition, a multiplex PCR for the simultaneous detection of C. parvum, C. hominis and other waterborne pathogens such as Giardia lamblia would greatly benefit the water industry and protect human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ont, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carey", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trevors", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Protozoan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Protozoan"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oocysts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}], "NumberOfReferences": "263"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14769405", "10.1016/j.watres.2003.10.012", "S0043-1354(03)00578-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
