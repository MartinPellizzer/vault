The effects of the UV light wavelength and ambient conditions on the surface properties of Sylgard-184 are probed using a battery of experimental probes, including static contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure, and X-ray reflectivity. Our results reveal that when exposed to UV, the PDMS macromolecules in the surface region of Sylgard-184 undergo chain scission, involving both the main chain backbone and the side groups. The radicals formed during this process recombine and form a network whose wetting properties are similar to those of a UV-modified model PDMS. In contrast to the UV radiation, the UVO treatment causes very significant changes in the surface and near-surface structure of Sylgard-184. Specifically, the molecular oxygen and ozone created during the UVO process interact with the UV-modified specimen. As a result of these interactions, the surface of the sample contains a large number of hydrophilic (mainly -OH) groups. In addition, the material density within the first approximately 5 nm reaches about 50% of that of pure silica. A major conclusion that can be drawn from the results and analysis described in this work is that the presence of the silica fillers in Sylgard-184 does not alter the surface properties of the UVO- and UV-modified Sylgard-184."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27695-7905, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Efimenko", "ForeName": "Kirill", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wallace", "ForeName": "William E", "Initials": "WE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Genzer", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Colloid Interface Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0043125", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9797"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12702402", "10.1006/jcis.2002.8594", "S0021979702985942"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
