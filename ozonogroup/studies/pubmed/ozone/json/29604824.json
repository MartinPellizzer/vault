The kinetics of quenching were measured over the temperature range 50-296 K using the Laval nozzle method. O(<sup>1</sup>D) atoms were prepared by 266 nm photolysis of ozone, and the decay of the O(<sup>1</sup>D) concentration was monitored through vacuum ultraviolet fluorescence at 115.215 nm, from which the rate constant was determined. To interpret the experiments, a quantum close-coupling treatment of the quenching transition from the <sup>1</sup>D state to the <sup>3</sup>P<sub>j</sub> fine-structure levels in collisions with Kr, and also Ar and Xe, was carried out. The relevant potential energy curves and spin-orbit coupling matrix elements were obtained in electronic structure calculations. We find reasonable agreement between computed temperature-dependent O(<sup>1</sup>D)-Rg (Rg = Ar, Kr, Xe) quenching rate constants and the present measurements for Kr and earlier measurements. In particular, the temperature dependence is well described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, UMR 5255, F-33400 Talence, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nu\u00f1ez-Reyes", "ForeName": "Dianailys", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742-2021, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u0142os", "ForeName": "Jacek", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742-2021, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000000243485111"], "LastName": "Alexander", "ForeName": "Millard H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218-2685, USA."}], "Identifier": ["000000026378221X"], "LastName": "Dagdigian", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, UMR 5255, F-33400 Talence, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hickson", "ForeName": "Kevin M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29604824", "10.1063/1.5021885"]}}]}
