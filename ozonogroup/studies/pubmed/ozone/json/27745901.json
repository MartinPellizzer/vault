We identified air pollutant monitoring stations located near these patients' residences in different administrative areas in Taiwan to determine the recorded concentrations of particulate matter \u22642.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter \u226410 \u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).

The mean age was 65.6 years (standard deviation, 12.7 years) and 67.7% of patients were male. The risk of CRAO onset was significantly increased (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; P\u00a0= 0.03) during a 5-day period following a 1 part per billion increase in NO<sub>2</sub> levels.
