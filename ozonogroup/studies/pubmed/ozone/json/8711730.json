Residents of this valley are predominantly nonsmoking members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). The area has moderately high average PM10 levels with periods of highly elevated PM10 concentrations due to local emissions being trapped in a stagnant air mass near the valley floor during low-level temperature inversion episodes. Due to a labor dispute, there was intermittent operation of the single largest pollution source, an old integrated steel mill. Levels of other common pollutants including sulfur dioxide, ozone, and acidic aerosol are relatively low. Studies specific to Utah Valley have observed that elevated PM10 concentrations are associated with: (1) decreased lung function; (2) increased incidence of respiratory symptoms; (3) increased school absenteeism; (4) increased respiratory hospital admissions; and (5) increased mortality, especially respiratory and cardiovascular mortality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pope", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA", "Suffix": "3rd"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}], "NumberOfReferences": "19"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8711730", "10.1016/0300-483x(96)03372-0", "0300-483X(96)03372-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
