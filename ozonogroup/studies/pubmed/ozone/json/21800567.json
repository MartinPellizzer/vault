Monitoring ozone with different ways and methods took an active part in understanding distribution and transformation of ozone, which was useful to controlling pollution emission. Spectra were got by multi-reflected white cell Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, inversed with nonlinear least squares (NLLSQ) method and then the concentrations of ozone were got exactly. The correlations of measured ozone concentration time series by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, open path UV differential optical absorption spectrometer and ozone analyzer of the Thermo Corporation were significant. The results showed that the measured ozone absolute concentrations with different monitoring methods and instruments had some differences, but the concentration diurnal variations were coincident and the correlations were good. Therefore, ozone concentration inversion method, based on multi-reflected cell Fourier transform infrared spectrum and not reported in domestic articles, could be used as an effective technique to measure ozone concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Environment Optics & Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China. sycheng@aiofm.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Si-yang", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Min-guang", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tian-shu", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yi-huai", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Jing-jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xiu-li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wen-qing", "Initials": "WQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21800567"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
