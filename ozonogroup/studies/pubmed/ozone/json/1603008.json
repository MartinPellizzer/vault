A significant relationship was noted, however, between asthma attendances and days when the airborne particulate index was above the acceptable threshold. No relationship was found between asthma attendances and ozone levels (a marker of photo-oxidant smog), or between any smog index and days of unusually high asthma attendance (asthma epidemic days).
