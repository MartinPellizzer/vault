Kiwifruit contains numerous minerals, vitamins, and dietary phytochemicals, that not only responsible for the flavor but can also serve as adjuncts in the treatment of diabetes, digestive disorders, cardiovascular system, cancer and heart disease. However, fruit quality and shelf life affect consumer's acceptance and production chain. Understanding the methods of fruit storage preservation, as well as their biochemical, physiological, and molecular basis is essential. In recent years, eco-friendly (comprehensive and environmentally friendly) treatments such as hot water, ozone, chitosan, quercetin, and antifungal additive from biocontrol bacteria or yeast have been applied to improve postharvest fruit quality with longer shelf life. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in control measures, applications, and mechanisms related to water loss, chilling injury, and pathogen diseases in postharvest kiwifruit. Further studies should utilize genome editing techniques to enhance postharvest fruit quality and disease resistance through site-directed bio-manipulation of the kiwifruit genome."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
