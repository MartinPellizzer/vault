The SO2 removal displays a clear dependence on relative humidity for all four alkene-ozone systems confirming a significant reaction for stabilised Criegee intermediates (SCI) with H2O. The observed SO2 removal kinetics are consistent with relative rate constants, k(SCI + H2O)/k(SCI + SO2), of 3.3 (\u00b11.1) \u00d7 10(-5) for CH2OO, 26 (\u00b110) \u00d7 10(-5) for CH3CHOO derived from cis-but-2-ene, 33 (\u00b110) \u00d7 10(-5) for CH3CHOO derived from trans-but-2-ene, and 8.7 (\u00b12.5) \u00d7 10(-5) for (CH3)2COO derived from 2,3-dimethyl-but-2-ene. The relative rate constants for k(SCI decomposition)/k(SCI + SO2) are -2.3 (\u00b13.5) \u00d7 10(11) cm(-3) for CH2OO, 13 (\u00b143) \u00d7 10(11) cm(-3) for CH3CHOO derived from cis-but-2-ene, -14 (\u00b131) \u00d7 10(11) cm(-3) for CH3CHOO derived from trans-but-2-ene and 63 (\u00b114) \u00d7 10(11) cm(-3) for (CH3)2COO. Uncertainties are \u00b12\u03c3 and represent combined systematic and precision components. These values are derived following the approximation that a single SCI is present for each system; a more comprehensive interpretation, explicitly considering the differing reactivity for syn- and anti-SCI conformers, is also presented. This yields values of 3.5 (\u00b13.1) \u00d7 10(-4) for k(SCI + H2O)/k(SCI + SO2) of anti-CH3CHOO and 1.2 (\u00b11.1) \u00d7 10(13) for k(SCI decomposition)/k(SCI + SO2) of syn-CH3CHOO. The reaction of the water dimer with CH2OO is also considered, with a derived value for k(CH2OO + (H2O)2)/k(CH2OO + SO2) of 1.4 (\u00b11.8) \u00d7 10(-2). The observed SO2 removal rate constants, which technically represent upper limits, are consistent with decomposition being a significant, structure dependent, sink in the atmosphere for syn-SCI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Birmingham, School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Birmingham, UK.
