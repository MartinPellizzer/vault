Untreated controls were cells with no siRNA transfection or BC treatment. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to measure mRNA and protein levels of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1) and downstream cytokine (IL-1\u03b2), respectively.", "Compared with untreated control cells, mRNA levels of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly higher (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) in control siRNA transfected cells with BC treatments. Compared with the control siRNA transfected cells, NLRP3 siRNA transfection reduced the expression of NLRP3 and ASC, whereas it had a limited effect on the expression of Caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 with FBC or OBC exposures. Under FBC treatment, the reductions of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 mRNA levels were 53.5% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and 34.2% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090. 01), respectively, and NLRP3 and ASC protein levels were lowered by 58.2% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and 45.4% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Under OBC treatment, the reductions of NLRP3 and Caspase-1 mRNA levels were 39.8% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and 25.6% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05), respectively, and NLRP3 and ASC protein levels were lowered by 44.8% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and 41.7% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Moreover, mRNA levels of ASC and IL-1\u03b2, the protein levels of Caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 showed a tendency to decrease in NLRP3 siRNA transfected cells, it was statistically insignificant (<i>p</i>\u2009>\u20090.05).", "NLRP3 siRNA transfection could partially reverse the increased mRNA levels of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, the protein levels of NLRP3 and ASC in HCECs with BC treatment, whereas the reductions of protein levels of Caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 were not significant, indicating that NLRP3 siRNA has a limited inhibitory effect on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by BC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhengyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liqiang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cutan Ocul Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101266892", "ISSNLinking": "1556-9527"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "IL1B protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammasomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NLRP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PYCARD protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.36", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammasomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35298317", "10.1080/15569527.2022.2050746"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
