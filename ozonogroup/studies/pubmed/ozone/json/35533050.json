Besides, several pieces of evidence indicate that air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) are major contributors to a wide range of non-communicable diseases. The present study investigated the effects of AAP, sulfur dioxide, and ozone on oxidative stress, histopathology, and some apoptosis-related genes expressions of lung tissue in a rat model.", "Thirty-two Wistar rats were randomly divided into the control, AAP, sulfur dioxide (10\u2009ppm), and ozone (0.6\u2009ppm) groups. After five consecutive weeks' exposure to the selected pollutants (3\u2009h/day), lung tissues were harvested and immediately fixed with formalin. The samples were routinely processed, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and finally assessed for presence of pathological changes. Expression changes of BAX, p-53, EGFR, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 were assayed using the RT-qPCR method. One hundred milligrams of lung tissues were extracted and the supernatants were used for assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GP<sub>X</sub>), and catalase activities.", "GPx activity was increased in the ozone (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.05) and AAP (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) groups and also MDA level in sulfur dioxide group (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.008). Pathological lesions were mild, moderate, and severe in the sulfur dioxide, ozone, and AAP groups, respectively, as compared to control group (<i>P</i> \u02c2 0.05). Exposure to AAP and sulfur dioxide enhanced BAX (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.002) and caspase-8 (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) mRNA expression, respectively. Caspases-3 and -8 mRNA expressions were elevated in ozone group (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001).", "The results indicated induction of oxidative stress. Our results suggest the apoptosis stimuli effect of AAP and also the extrinsic apoptotic pathway trigger effect of sulfur dioxide and ozone in the lung tissue in the concentrations used in the present study. The histopathological and the genes expression changes may be a result of the induced oxidative stress in the lung tissues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6249-4462"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kheirouri", "ForeName": "Sorayya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9449-0607"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Immunology research center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shanehbandi", "ForeName": "Dariush", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khordadmehr", "ForeName": "Monireh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7408-8573"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alizadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Eskandari Vaezi", "ForeName": "Fateme", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Musapour Sultan Abad", "ForeName": "Razieh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0276-930X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mesgari-Abbasi", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Exp Lung Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004944", "ISSNLinking": "0190-2148"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 8"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35533050", "10.1080/01902148.2022.2072977"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
