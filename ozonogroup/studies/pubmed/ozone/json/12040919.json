The search for asthma susceptibility genes has been complicated by the broad clinical phenotype of asthma, the polygenic inheritance pattern of this disease, and the substantial role of environmental exposures in the development and progression of asthma. Inhaled environmental agents induce several biologic responses in asthmatics; including the induction of acquired and innate immunity that leads to acute and chronic forms of airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Acquired immune responses to protein antigens, such as house dust mite allergen, often induce type 2 T lymphocyte-driven responses (Th2) which appear to be important in atopic asthma. Recent studies by our group and others demonstrate that innate immunity, initiated by inhalation of bacterial and viral pathogens, organic dusts, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), air pollution particulate matter, and ozone, can also cause acute and chronic forms of airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, and even airway remodeling. Emerging evidence indicates that both acquired and innate immune responses in the lung may be influenced by polymorphic genes. For instance, functional polymorphisms in the IL-4 receptor gene are thought to preferentially stimulate acquired Th2 immune responses to inhaled allergens, and we have recently shown that common co-segregating mutations in TLR4 (a transmembrane receptor for LPS) are associated with diminished airway responsiveness to inhaled LPS. These observations suggest that environmental challenges can be used to narrow the phenotype of asthma and allow scientists to investigate unique gene-environment interactions that are involved in the development of biologically specific forms of asthma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Genetics, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA. david.schwartz@duke.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "David A", "Initials": "DA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES07498", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES09607", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL62628", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL64855", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Int J Hyg Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "100898843", "ISSNLinking": "1438-4639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drosophila Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TLR4 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoconstriction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Mutational Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drosophila Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12040919", "10.1078/1438-4639-00117", "S1438-4639(04)70148-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
