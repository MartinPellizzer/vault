Our study examined the effects of these factors on allergic diseases (i.e., asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis) among preschool children. We recruited a total of 120 preschool children from an ongoing birth cohort study in the Greater Taipei Area. A comprehensive environmental evaluation was conducted at each participant's residence and included measurements of indoor and outdoor air pollutants, fungal spores, endotoxins, and house dust mite allergens. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on the allergic diseases and home environments of participants. Land-use characteristics and points of interest in the surrounding area of each home were analyzed. Other covariates were obtained from the cohort data. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the relationships between allergic diseases and covariates. We observed that all mean indoor air pollutant levels were below Taiwan's indoor air quality standards. After adjustment for covariates, the total number of fungal spores and the ozone, Der f 1, and endotoxin levels were significantly associated with increased risks of allergic diseases. Biological contaminants more significantly affected allergic diseases than other pollutants. Moreover, home environmental characteristics (e.g., living near power facilities and gas stations) were associated with an increased risk of allergic diseases. Regular and proper home sanitation is recommended to prevent the accumulation of indoor pollutants, especially biological contaminants. Living away from potential sources of pollution is also crucial for protecting the health of children."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
