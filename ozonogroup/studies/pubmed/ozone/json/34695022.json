A comparison between various treatment options such as electro-flocculation, electro-flocculation in the presence of a catalyst, and catalytic ozonation in combination with electro-flocculation was explored. Moreover, the effect of different factors such as pH, time, catalyst dose, ozone dose, radical scavenger, and voltage has been studied in each treatment option mentioned earlier. The results indicated that the best treatment option was found to be catalytic ozonation in combination with electro-flocculation with removal efficiency (RE) of 90.31% at pH 10 after 30 min of the treatment process. The hydroxyl radical scavenger effect indicated that the synergistic catalytic process follows a radical mechanism. It is therefore concluded that CuMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/gC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-zeolite catalysts in synergic electro-flocculation-catalytic ozonation process may be effectively used for the treatment of textile wastewaters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ikhlaq", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Mahrukh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan E-mail: farhan.javed@uet.edu.pk."}], "LastName": "Javed", "ForeName": "Farhan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sustainable Development Study Centre, Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yasar", "ForeName": "Abdullah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Management and Technology, Johar Town, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Asia", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering and Research, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shabbir", "ForeName": "Sidra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Engineering and Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O0HDY58362", "NameOfSubstance": "Remazol black B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34695022", "10.2166/wst.2021.404"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
