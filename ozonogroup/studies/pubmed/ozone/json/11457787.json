A nasal exposure system was developed in which a constant flow of humidified air (V) containing a constant concentration of O(3) (C(inlet)) entered one nostril and then exited the other nostril while a subject closed the velopharyngeal aperture. Experiments were conducted on 10 healthy nonsmokers for whom O(3) concentration was measured at the inlet nostril and the outlet nostril to determine the fraction of inhaled O(3) that was absorbed into the nasal mucosa (Lambda(nose)). Lambda(nose) decreased from 0.80 +/- 0.02 to 0.33 +/- 0.02 (SE) when V was increased from 3 to 15 l/min and C(inlet) was fixed at 0.4 ppm. Analysis of these data with a mathematical model indicated that O(3) uptake was limited by diffusion reaction through mucus, rather than by convective diffusion through the respired gas. A small decrease in Lambda(nose) from 0.36 +/- 0.02 to 0.32 +/- 0.01 was also observed when C(inlet) was increased from 0.1 to 0.4 ppm at a fixed V of 15 l/min. This may have been due to nonlinear reaction kinetics between O(3) and reactive substrates in mucus or an active response by a physiological process such as mucus secretion or transepithelial water influx."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Santiago", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hann", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-Jebria", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01-ES-0675", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11457787", "10.1152/jappl.2001.91.2.725"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
