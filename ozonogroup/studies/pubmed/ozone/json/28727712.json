However, so far no proof-of-concept studies in animals have been available.", "This study was designed to investigate whether IVF ozone has an analgesic effect on animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.", "Experimental trial in rats.", "Institute for Biomedical Sciences of Pain.", "By IVF injection, a volume of 50 \u00b5l containing 30 \u00b5g/mL ozone-oxygen mixture or 50 \u00b5l air was carried out on male Sprague-Dawley rats of na\u00efve, inflammatory pain states produced by injections of either bee venom or complete Freud's adjuvant, and neuropathic pain state produced by spared nerve injury, respectively. The effects of IVF ozone on pain-related behaviors were evaluated for 2 weeks or one month. Then combined use of gabapentin (100 mg/1 kg body weight) with IVF ozone was evaluated in rats with neuropathic pain by intraperitoneal administration 5 days after the ozone treatment. Finally, the analgesic effects of another 4 drugs, AMD3100 (a CXCR4 antagonist), A-803467 (a selective Nav1.8 blocker), rapamycin (the mTOR inhibitor), and MGCD0103 (a selective histone deacetylase inhibitor) were evaluated for long term through IVF injection, respectively.", "(1) IVF injection of ozone at L4-5 was only effective in suppression of mechanical allodynia in rats with neuropathic pain but not with inflammatory pain;
