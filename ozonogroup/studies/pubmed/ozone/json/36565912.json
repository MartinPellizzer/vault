Accurate O<sub>3</sub> predictions can better help assess its impacts on public health and facilitate the development of effective prevention and control measures. In this study, we used a random forest (RF) model to construct a bias-correction model to correct the bias in the predictions of hourly O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-1h), daily maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-Max8h), and daily maximum 1-h O<sub>3</sub> (O<sub>3</sub>-Max1h) concentrations from the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in the Yangtze River Delta region. The results show that the RF model successfully captures the nonlinear response relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and its influence factors, and has an outstanding performance in correcting the bias of O<sub>3</sub> predictions. The normalized mean biases (NMBs) of O<sub>3</sub>-1h, O<sub>3</sub>-Max8h, and O<sub>3</sub>-Max1h decrease from 15.8%, 20.0%, and 17.0.% to 0.5%, -0.8%, and 0.1%, respectively; correlation coefficients increase from 0.78, 0.90, and 0.89 to 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94, respectively. For O<sub>3</sub>-1h and O<sub>3</sub>-Max8h, the original CMAQ model shows an obvious bias in the central and southern Zhejiang region, while the RF model decreases the NMB values from 54% to -1% and 34% to -4%, respectively. The O<sub>3</sub>-1h bias is mainly caused by the bias of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). Relative humidity and temperature are also important factors that lead to the bias of O<sub>3</sub>. For high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, the temperature bias and O<sub>3</sub> observations are the major reasons for the discrepancy between the model and the observations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
