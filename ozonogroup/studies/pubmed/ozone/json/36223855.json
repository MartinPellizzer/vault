The effects of fireworks on the physicochemical characteristics of atmospheric particles are well documented. However, the influence of firework burning on ambient volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions remains unclear. To determine the impact of firework-burning events on VOC emissions, ambient VOCs were measured at a receptor site on the Fenwei Plain during the Chinese Spring Festival period. Firework-burning plumes were identified by using potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) as tracers, and twenty VOC species were obtained as firework tracers. The emission ratios of the VOC species relative to K<sup>+</sup> were in a range of 5.40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup>-1.41\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>/\u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> and were first estimated through the linear fitting method and source-tracer-ratio method. The VOC contributions of firework burning during the Lantern Festival (31.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3%) were higher than the levels during the Chinese New Year (28.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5%). The daytime net ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) formation rates during the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival increased by 11.4% and 15.2%, respectively, on average due to firework emissions. Secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP) increased by 18.2% and 34.1% on average, respectively. These results can provide the source tracers of fireworks, and can subsequently help assess their impact on regional air quality and public health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
