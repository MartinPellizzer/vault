Few studies examined the association between O<sub>3</sub> and diabetes especially in developing countries. This study was designed to investigate the above topic in China.", "We conducted a prospective cohort study based on a nationwide survey of 13,548 adults from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. City-level exposure to ozone for each participant was matched through ChinaHighO<sub>3</sub> dataset. Time-varying cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to determine the association. Stratification analyses were conducted to explore potential effect modification.", "The annual mean concentration of O<sub>3</sub> was 86.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in 1-year average O<sub>3</sub> concentration was associated with 5.7% (95% CI: 1.004-1.114) relative increment in hazards ratio of diabetes incidence in the fully adjusted model. Results stayed stable when controlling for physical activity, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and mean temperature.", "Our findings provided initial support for a positive and robust association between long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and diabetes incidence in a developing country. More scientific and social attention should be attached to the ozone-induced risks of diabetes occurrence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
