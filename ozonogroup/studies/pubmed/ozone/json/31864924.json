A recent study reported a decreased trend in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over 2013-2017, but O<sub>3</sub> pollution has become more serious. However, the effects of surface O<sub>3</sub> on crops are unclear after the implementation of the \"Action Plan\". Here, we evaluated the potential negative effects of surface O<sub>3</sub> on three main food crops (winter wheat, maize and rice) across China during 2015-2018 using nationwide O<sub>3</sub> monitoring data and AOT40-yield response functions. Results suggested that mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration, AOT40 and relative yield loss in China showed an overall upward trend from 2015 to 2018. During winter wheat, maize, single rice, double-early rice, and double-late rice growing seasons, mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration in recent years ranged from 38.6 to 46.9\u00a0ppb, 40.2-43.9\u00a0ppb, 39.3-42.2\u00a0ppb, 33.8-40.0\u00a0ppb, and 35.9-39.1\u00a0ppb, respectively, and AOT40 mean values ranged from 8.5 to 14.3\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 10.5-13.4\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 9.8-11.9\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 5.2-9.2\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, and 8.0-9.5\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, respectively. O<sub>3</sub>-induced yield reductions were estimated to range from 20.1 to 33.3% for winter wheat, 5.0-6.3% for maize, 7.3-8.8% for single rice, 3.9-6.8% for double-early rice and 5.9-7.1% for double-late rice. O<sub>3</sub>-induced production losses for winter wheat, maize, single rice, double-early rice, and double-late rice totaled 39.5-88.2 million metric tons, 12.6-21.0 million metric tons, 9.5-11.3 million metric tons, 1.2-1.8 million metric tons, and 2.2-2.7 million metric tons, respectively, and the corresponding economic losses totaled 14.3-32.0 billion US$, 3.9-6.5 billion US$, 3.9-4.6 billion US$, 0.5-0.7 billion US$, and 0.9-1.1 billion US$, respectively. Our results suggested that the government should take effective measures to reduce O<sub>3</sub> pollution and its effects on agricultural production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
