The two waters had considerably different water quality and therefore ozone demands. The spiked sample waters were ozonated using the batch method of ozonation at a range of doses and the samples were analysed for toxins using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The toxin content of the samples was also determined using a protein phosphatase type 2A inhibition assay (PP2A) and toxicity via the standard mouse bioassay. The HPLC results correlated well with the PP2A results and toxicity tests for both waters. A loss of both toxins and toxicity was observed with increasing ozone dose, resulting in a complete loss of toxicity for both waters once an ozone residual had been achieved. At this ozone residual no toxin was detected using HPLC. The results indicate that microcystins are not transformed into toxic by-products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes Campus, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia. sam_brooke@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brooke", "ForeName": "Samuel", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Newcombe", "ForeName": "Gayle", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nicholson", "ForeName": "Brenton", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klass", "ForeName": "Gunter", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicon", "NlmUniqueID": "1307333", "ISSNLinking": "0041-0101"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "96180-79-9", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin-LA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.16", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EQ8332842Y", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanoginosin LR"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17030055", "10.1016/j.toxicon.2006.08.010", "S0041-0101(06)00331-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
