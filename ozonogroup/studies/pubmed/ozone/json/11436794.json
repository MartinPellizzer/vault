Effects of carbonates on these efficiencies were also investigated. Elimination of carbonates from the water increased TOC reduction efficiency of all the methods. The effect of the carbonates on the O3 method was less significant than that on the other methods. The O3/UV method was the most effective for reducing TOC under both carbonate-present and decarbonated conditions. The catalytic ozone process (O3/TiO2) showed a tendency to increase the ozonation efficiency at the beginning of the reaction under the decarbonated condition, but the addition of the TiO2 catalyst inhibited the ozonation under the carbonate-present condition. The photocatalytic oxidation process (UV/TiO2) did not reduce TOC as much as the other methods, but it could reduce TOC over a long time. And the O3/UV/TiO2 method did not show a synergistic effect of ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation. Furthermore, zonation prior to coagulation increased TOC reduction efficiency of coagulation, but this effect was also affected by the carbonates in water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd., 502 Kandatsu, Tsuchiura, Ibaraki 300-0013, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuzuki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takagi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11436794"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
