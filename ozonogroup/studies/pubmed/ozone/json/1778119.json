Inhibition of primary production by SUVR was observed to a depth of 6 m and at intensities which were approximately 1% of the UV-B intensity at the lake surface. Significant inhibition of primary production by SUVR was restricted to the top third of the euphotic zone. The order of relative sensitivities of offshore Lake Michigan phytoplankton assemblages during different seasons to inhibition by SUVR were spring ED50 = 17.6 kJ/m2 UV-B) greater than fall (ED50 = 30.5 kJ/m2 UV-B) greater than summer (ED50 = 131.6 kJ/m2 UV-B). A hazard assessment model predicted a significant reduction (13%) in areal (total water column) primary production for offshore Lake Michigan due to current SUVR intensities. Concern about possible increased reduction of primary production in the North American Great Lakes due to depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer appears to be unwarranted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1222."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gala", "ForeName": "W R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giesy", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicarbonates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bicarbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytoplankton"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1778119", "10.1016/0147-6513(91)90084-3", "0147-6513(91)90084-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
