Local data of sudden, severe ozone depletions (<250 Dobson units) and the corresponding increase of UVB radiation were reviewed.", "Patients with sunburn increased significantly during the austral spring of 1999 (P <.01). This was especially noticeable (29/31 cases) on weekends with ozone depletion, and increased UVB radiation (P <.01) occurred on the Sundays Oct 31, Nov 21, and Dec 5, 1999. The incidence of photosensitivity disorders, although statistically not significant, increased 51% over the past 7 years.", "An acute impact on human health (sunburn) occurred because of abrupt ozone depletion and the accompanying increase in UVB during the mid and late austral spring of 1999. Most sunburns (93.5%) occurred on weekends. Ozone levels as well as seasonal and recreational factors played a mayor role in the increase in sunburns. The increase in radiation at 300 nm, the most carcinogenic wavelength, on days under the Antarctic ozone hole is a matter of special concern."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dermatology Unit, Hospital Regional de Punta Arenas, Chile."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abarca", "ForeName": "Jaime F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Casiccia", "ForeName": "Claudio C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zamorano", "ForeName": "Felix D", "Initials": "FD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Acad Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "7907132", "ISSNLinking": "0190-9622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosensitivity Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Registries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sunburn"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11807429", "10.1067/mjd.2002.118556", "S0190-9622(02)28036-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
