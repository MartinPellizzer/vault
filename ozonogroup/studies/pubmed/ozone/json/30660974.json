Zamioculcas zamiifolia had the highest O<sub>3</sub> removal efficiency. To enhance O<sub>3</sub> removal by Z. zamiifolia, adding a compatible endophytic bacteria, Bacillus cereus ERBP into Z. zamiifolia was studied. After operating under an O<sub>3</sub> continuous system (150-250 ppb) at a flow rate of 0.3\u202fL\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> for 80\u202fh, inoculated plants (74%) exhibited higher O<sub>3</sub> removal efficiency than non-inoculated ones (53%). In addition, after O<sub>3</sub> exposure (80\u202fh), the population of B. cereus ERBP in inoculated plants was significantly increased in both shoots approximately 35 folds and leaves 13 folds compared to inoculated plants without O<sub>3</sub> exposure. The results also showed that B. cereus ERBP had the ability to protect Z. zamiifolia against O<sub>3</sub> stress conditions. The increase in B. cereus ERBP populations was attributed to the significant increase in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) activity. In addition, increasing B. cereus ERBP populations led to raise total flavonoid contents which is one of antioxidant compounds. Increasing APX, CAT activities, and total flavonoid contents can enhance O<sub>3</sub> detoxification in plant tissues. The mechanism of B. cereus ERBP for enhancing O<sub>3</sub> phytoremediation was proposed in this study. The results suggested that B. cereus ERBP was a potential tool for alleviating O<sub>3</sub> stress on Z. zamiifolia and enhancing O<sub>3</sub> phytoremediation efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
