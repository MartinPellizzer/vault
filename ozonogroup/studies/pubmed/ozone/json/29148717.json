However, optical trapping of strongly light-absorbing particles such as black carbon or soot is quite difficult because the repulsive force caused by heat is orders of magnitude larger than the attractive force of radiation pressure. In this study, a laser trapping and Raman microspectroscopy system using an annular laser beam was constructed to achieve noncontact levitation of single light-absorbing particles in air. Single acetylene carbon black or candle soot particles were arbitrarily selected with a glass capillary connected to a three-axis oil hydraulic micromanipulator and introduced into a minute space surrounded by a repulsive force at the focal point of an objective lens. Using the developed system, we achieved optical levitation of micrometer-sized carbonaceous particles and observation of their Raman spectra in air. Furthermore, we demonstrated in situ observations of changes in the morphology and chemical composition of optically trapped carbonaceous particles in air, which were induced by heterogeneous oxidation reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Hiroshima University , Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8526, Japan."}], "LastName": "Uraoka", "ForeName": "Masaru", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Hiroshima University , Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8526, Japan."}], "LastName": "Maegawa", "ForeName": "Keisuke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9866-5809"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Hiroshima University , Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8526, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ishizaka", "ForeName": "Shoji", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29148717", "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03455"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
