Enrichment of samples in dilute liquid medium improved culturability of the bacteria by approximately log unit, to 9% up to 70% of the total cell counts. Genomic fingerprinting and 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that most (68%) of the isolates belonged to the Betaproteobacteria and 25% were identified as Alphaproteobacteria. The number of different genera within the Betaproteobacteria was higher in the GAC filters treating ozonated water than in the filters treating nonozonated water. Polaromonas was observed in nearly all of the GAC filters (86%), and the genera Hydrogenophaga, Sphingomonas and Afipia were observed in 43%, 33% and 29% of the filter beds, respectively. AFLP analysis revealed that the predominating genus Polaromonas included a total of 23 different genotypes.", "This study is the first to demonstrate that Polaromonas, which has mainly been observed in ultraoligotrophic freshwater environments, is a common component of the microbial community in GAC filters used in water treatment.", "The predominance of ultraoligotrophic bacteria in the GAC filters indicates that very low concentrations of substrates are available for microbial growth. Polaromonas species are suited for further studies on the nutritional versatility and growth kinetics enabling the modelling of biodegradation processes in GAC filters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Het Waterlaboratorium, Haarlem, The Netherlands.
