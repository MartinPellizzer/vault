Ozonation was performed in a semi-batch bubble column reactor at pH of 11 and 4.5. Batch biological treatment was conducted in shake flasks. Samples obtained during the treatments were monitored for BOD5, COD, TOC, and molecular weight distribution. At an ozone dosage of 0.7-0.8 mg O3/mL wastewater, integrated treatment showed about 30% higher TOC mineralization compared to individual ozonation or biotreatment. Ozone treatment enhanced the biodegradability of the effluent (monitored as 21% COD reduction and 13% BOD5 enhancement), allowing for a higher removal of pollutants. The conversion of high molecular weight (HMW) to low molecular weight (LMW) compounds was an important factor in the overall biodegradability enhancement of the alkaline effluent. The overall biodegradability of the LMW compounds did not change over the course of ozonation, but it increased from 5% to 50% (measured as COD removal) for the HMW portion. Ozonation at pH of 11 was more effective than that at pH of 4.5 in terms of generating more biodegradable compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The University of British Columbia, 2216 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z4."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bijan", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohseni", "ForeName": "Madjid", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16139863", "10.1016/j.watres.2005.07.018", "S0043-1354(05)00374-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
