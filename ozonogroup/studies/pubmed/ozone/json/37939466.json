However, it is also a highly energy-consuming technology, usually accounting for 30%\u223c40% of the total electricity consumption of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The O<sub>3</sub> consumption per unit of COD removed (g-O<sub>3</sub>/g-COD) is usually higher than 1.5\u00a0g-O<sub>3</sub>/g-COD, and the total carbon emission from catalytic ozonation is usually higher than 393.12 kgCO<sub>2</sub> e/m<sup>3</sup> of wastewater. In this study, we investigated an energy reduction strategy for the biggest catalytic ozonation WWTP, from laboratory-scale experimentation to corresponding engineering application. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that the mass transfer rate of dissolved O<sub>3</sub> to the catalyst surface is crucial for COD removal efficiency. To improve the efficiency of catalytic ozonation, adding effluent backflow is a simple method that can enhance the removal of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the catalyst surface and promote surface exposure. In the pilot-scale experiment (48\u00a0m<sup>3</sup>/d), when the backflow ratio increased from 0% to 100% (the optimal value), the proteins in EPS on the catalyst surface decreased significantly by 66.7%. The corresponding O<sub>3</sub> consumption per unit of COD removed was reduced from 2.0 to 1.0\u00a0g-O<sub>3</sub>/g-COD. Furthermore, in the engineering application (52,000\u00a0m<sup>3</sup>/d) with a backflow ratio of 100%, the average effluent COD reduced from 52.0 to 43.3\u00a0mg/L, and the O<sub>3</sub> consumption per unit of COD removed decreased from 0.98 to 0.69\u00a0g-O<sub>3</sub>/g-COD. In terms of carbon reduction, the indirect carbon emission reduction was approximately 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>3</sup>\u00a0t CO<sub>2</sub> e/a. This study demonstrates the advantages of catalytic ozonation improvement and provides an engineering model of energy conversation and carbon emission reduction for over 35 similar WWTPs in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
