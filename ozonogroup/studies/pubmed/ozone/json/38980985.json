This study investigated how ozone treatment modulates the levels of secondary metabolites associated with phenylpropanoid metabolism, the related enzyme activities, and gene expression in cantaloupe. Treating cantaloupes with 15\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup> of ozone after precooling can help maintain postharvest hardness. This treatment also enhances the production and accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as total phenols, flavonoids, and lignin. These metabolites are essential components of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, activating enzymes like phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4CL, chalcone synthase, and chalcone isomerase. The results of the transcriptional expression patterns showed that differential gene expression related to phenylpropanoid metabolism in the peel of ozone-treated cantaloupes was primarily observed during the middle and late storage stages. In contrast, the pulp exhibited significant differential gene expression mainly during the early storage stage. Furthermore, it was observed that the level of gene expression in the peel was generally higher than that in the pulp. The correlation between the relative amount of gene changes in cantaloupe, activity of selected enzymes, and concentration of secondary metabolites could be accompanied by positive regulation of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. Therefore, ozone stress induction positively enhances the biosynthesis of flavonoids in cantaloupes, leading to an increased accumulation of secondary metabolites. Additionally, it also improves the postharvest storage quality of cantaloupes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Institute of Food Technologists."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
