Direct oxidation with ozone can occur by this route or indirectly, generating reactive oxygen species through the catalytic activation of the ozone molecule. Then, many catalytic materials were evaluated, such as unsupported and supported oxides, activated carbon, nanocarbons, carbon nitride, and mesoporous materials. This review focuses on the properties and performance of Ni-based catalysts (NiO, supported NiO, Ni ferrites, and M-Ni bimetallic), emphasizing the reaction mechanisms and the importance of the reactive oxygen species in removing toxic organic compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
