The antibacterial efficacy of ozone was tested against both broth and biofilm cultures. Ozone was sparged for 30, 60, 120 and 240 s, through overnight broth cultures of a strain of E. faecalis (E78.2) and compared with those that were centrifuged, washed and resuspended in water. Enterococcus faecalis (E78.2) biofilms were grown on cellulose nitrate membrane filters for 48 h and suspended in water through which ozone gas was sparged with stirring for 60, 120 and 240 s in a standard fashion. In a separate test, biofilms were also exposed to gaseous ozone. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was used as a positive control. All experiments were repeated four times.", "There were significant (P < 0.05) reductions of bacteria in the unwashed (2 log(10) reductions) and washed (5 log(10) reductions) broth cultures following 240 s applications. Biofilms incubated for 240 s with ozonated water showed no significant reduction in cell viability attributable to ozone alone, whereas with NaOCl no viable cells were detected over the same time. Gaseous ozone applied for 300 s had no effect on these biofilms.", "Ozone had an antibacterial effect on planktonic E. faecalis cells and those suspended in fluid, but little effect when embedded in biofilms. Its antibacterial efficacy was not comparable with that of NaOCl under the test conditions used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Endodontology, Eastman Dental Institute for Oral Health Care Sciences, University College London, London WC1X 8LD, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hems", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gulabivala", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "Y-L", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ready", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Spratt", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int Endod J", "NlmUniqueID": "8004996", "ISSNLinking": "0143-2885"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15606819", "10.1111/j.1365-2591.2004.00891.x", "IEJ891"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
