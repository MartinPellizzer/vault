In plant cells, a number of MAP kinases were specifically involved in oxidative burst (OXB) or hypersensitive response (HR) in response to biotic stresses, besides salicylic acid (SA) induced MAP kinase (SIPK) and ROS play the crucial roles in the processes of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) being established. The reciprocal relationship between SIPK and ROS could be essential in response to abiotic stresses in plant cells, because it was indicated that ozone, wounding, or osmotic stimuli activated SIPK. Together, these primary results showed that MAP kinases were required for ROS signaling in response to stress in plant cells, and more studies are in demand in this area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chun-Peng", "Initials": "CP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "101156321", "ISSNLinking": "1671-3877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}], "NumberOfReferences": "76"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15692172"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
