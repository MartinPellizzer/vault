This practice, which is referred to as potable water reuse, typically relies upon reverse osmosis (RO) treatment followed by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and addition of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). These two treatment processes individually are capable of controlling many of the chemical and microbial contaminants in wastewater; however, a few chemicals may still be present after treatment at concentrations that affect water quality. Low-molecular weight (<200 Da), uncharged compounds represent the greatest challenge for RO treatment. For potable water reuse systems, compounds of greatest concern include oxidation products formed during treatment (e.g., N-nitrosodimethylamine, halogenated disinfection byproducts) and compounds present in wastewater effluent (e.g., odorous compounds, organic solvents). Although the concentrations of most of these compounds decrease to levels where they no longer compromise water quality after they encounter the second treatment barrier (i.e., UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), low-molecular weight compounds that are resistant to direct photolysis and exhibit low reactivity with hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) may persist. While attempts to identify the compounds that pass through both barriers have accounted for approximately half of the dissolved organic carbon remaining after treatment, it is unlikely that a significant fraction of the remaining unknowns will ever be identified with current analytical techniques. Nonetheless, the toxicity-weighted concentration of certain known compounds (e.g., disinfection byproducts) is typically lower in RO-UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated water than conventional drinking water. To avoid the expense associated with managing the concentrate produced by RO, environmental engineers have begun to employ alternative treatment barriers. The use of alternatives such as nanofiltration, ozonation followed by biological filtration, or activated carbon filtration avoids the problems associated with the production and disposal of RO concentrate, but they may allow a larger number of chemical contaminants to pass through the treatment process. In addition to the transformation products and solvents that pose risks in the RO-UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system, these alternative barriers are challenged by larger, polar compounds that are not amenable to oxidation, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and phosphate-containing flame retardants. To fully protect consumers who rely upon potable water reuse systems, new policies are needed to prevent chemicals that are difficult to remove during advanced treatment from entering the sewer system. By using knowledge about the composition of municipal wastewater and the mechanisms through which contaminants are removed during treatment, it should be possible to safely reuse municipal wastewater effluent as a drinking water source."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marron", "ForeName": "Emily L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4917-0938"], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology , Eawag , CH-8600 D\u00fcbendorf , Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering , \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne , CH-1015 Lausanne , Switzerland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6852-8977"], "LastName": "Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs von", "Initials": "UV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1686-8464"], "LastName": "Sedlak", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P42 ES004705", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acc Chem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0157313", "ISSNLinking": "0001-4842"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no competing financial interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Sedlak DL Water 4.0: The Past, Present, and Future of the World\u2019s Most Vital Resource; Yale University Press: New Haven, CT, 2014."}, {"Citation": "Cutler D; Miller G The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth-Century United States.
