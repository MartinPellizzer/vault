In this study, we examine the manageable portion of ground-level ozone using two simulations of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for the year 2010 and a probabilistic analysis approach involving 29\u00a0years (1990-2018) of historical ozone observations. The modeling results reveal that the reduction in the peak ozone levels from total elimination of anthropogenic emissions within the model domain is around 13-21 ppb for the 90th-100th percentile range of the daily maximum 8-hr ozone concentrations across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Large reductions in the 4th highest 8-hr ozone are seen in the regions of West (interquartile range (IQR) of 17-33%), South (IQR 22-34%), Central (IQR 19-31%), Southeast (IQR 25-34%), and Northeast (IQR 24-37%). However, sites in the western portion of the domain generally show smaller reductions even when all anthropogenic emissions are removed, possibly due to the strong influence of global background ozone, including sources such as intercontinental ozone transport, stratospheric ozone intrusions, wildfires, and biogenic precursor emissions. Probabilistic estimates of the exceedances for several hypothetical thresholds of the 4th highest 8-hr ozone indicate that, in some areas, exceedances of such hypothetical thresholds may occur even with no anthropogenic emissions due to the ever-present atmospheric stochasticity and the current global tropospheric ozone burden. <i>Implications</i>: Because air pollution is intricately linked to adverse health effects, National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established for criteria pollutants to safeguard human health and the environment. Areas not in compliance with the relevant standards are required to develop plans and policies to reduce their air pollution levels. Regional-scale air quality models are currently being used routinely to inform policies to identify the emissions reduction required to meet and maintain the NAAQS throughout the country. This paper examines the feasibility of the 4th highest ozone, which is used to derive the ozone design value for NAAQS, complying with various current and hypothetical 8-hr ozone thresholds over CONUS based on the information embedded in 29 years of historical ozone observations and two modeling scenarios with and without anthropogenic emissions loading."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4171-7951"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Connecticut , Storrs-Mansfield, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Huiying", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3892-6672"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Connecticut , Storrs-Mansfield, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Astitha", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3460-7762"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Connecticut , Storrs-Mansfield, Connecticut, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences, North Carolina State University , Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "S Trivikrama", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3280-3513"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Hogrefe", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8927-5876"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA."}], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Astitha M, Luo H, Rao ST, Hogrefe C, Mathur R, Kumar N, 2017.
