It is also unknown whether the seasonal variation in apnea-hypopnea index influences continuous positive airway pressure treatment dose. This study aims to examine the seasonality of obstructive sleep apnea and continuous positive airway pressure treatment, and the association between air pollutants and apnea-hypopnea index in adults with different sleep apnea severity during different sleep stages.", "Polysomnography of 5,413 patients referred to one sleep center during 2008-2015 were examined retrospectively. Ambient conditions and air pollutants levels were collected from the official air condition surveillance database. Cosinor analysis was used to examine seasonal variances. The general linear model was used to examine associations between air conditions and apnea-hypopnea index adjusted for seasonality. Models for apnea-hypopnea index in different sleep stages, sex groups, and obstructive sleep apnea severity groups were analyzed separately.", "Seasonal variations for continuous positive airway pressure treatment were not significant. Particulate matter less than or equal to 10 \u03bcm, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and relative humidity were associated with apnea-hypopnea index only in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea. The association was significant only in non-rapid eye movement sleep.", "An adjustment for continuous positive airway treatment dose by season is not warranted. Protection for air pollutant-vulnerable groups should be provided.
