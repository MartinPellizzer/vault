In situ quartz crystal microbalance measurements are used to monitor the mass changes during growth, which are coupled with ex situ materials characterization following deposition to evaluate the resulting film composition and structure. We determined that during O3 post-treatment of ALD-grown MnO, O3 oxidizes the near-surface region corresponding to a conversion of 22 \u00c5 of the MnO film to MnO2. Following oxidation by O3, exposure of Mn(EtCp)2 results in mass gains of over 300 ng/cm(2), which exceeds the expected mass gain for reaction of the Mn(EtCp)2 precursor with surface hydroxyls by over four times. We attribute this high mass gain to adsorbed Mn(EtCp)2 shedding its EtCp ligands at the surface and releasing Mn(II) ions which subsequently diffuse into the bulk film and partially reduce the oxidized film back to MnO. These Mn(EtCp)2 and O3 reactions are combined in sequential steps with (a) Mn(EtCp)2 reacting at the surface of an O-rich layer, shedding its two EtCp ligands and freeing Mn(II) to diffuse into the film followed by (b) O3 oxidizing the film surface and withdrawing Mn from the subsurface to create an O-rich layer. This deposition process results in self-limiting multilayer deposition of crystalline Mn5O8 films with a density of 4.7 g/cm(3) and an anomalously high growth rate of 5.7 \u00c5/cycle. Mn5O8 is a metastable phase of manganese oxide which possesses an intermediate composition between the alternating MnO and MnO2 compositions of the near-surface during the Mn(EtCp)2 and O3 exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "Matthias J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Hare", "ForeName": "Christopher D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Cavanagh", "ForeName": "Andrew S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Musgrave", "ForeName": "Charles B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "Steven M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27351207", "10.1021/acsami.6b04529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
