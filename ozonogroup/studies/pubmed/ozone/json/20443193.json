In this study, comparative proteomic approach was employed to explore the differential changes of proteins in O3 target structures such as leaf and chloroplasts of soybean seedlings. Acute O3 exposure (120 parts-per-billion) for 3 days did not cause any visible symptoms in developing leaves. However, higher amounts of ROS and lipid peroxidation indicated that severe oxidative burst occurred. Immunoblot analysis of O3-induced known proteins revealed that proteins were modulated before symptoms became visible. Proteomic analysis identified a total of 20 and 32 differentially expressed proteins from O3-treated leaf and chloroplast, respectively. Proteins associated with photosynthesis, including photosystem I/II and carbon assimilation decreased following exposure to O3. In contrast, proteins involved in antioxidant defense and carbon metabolism increased. The activity of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism increased following exposure to O3, which is consistent with the decrease in starch and increase in sucrose concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that carbon allocation is tightly programmed, and starch degradation probably feeds the tricarboxylic acid cycle while the photosynthesis pathway is severely affected during O3 stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Crop Science, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahsan", "ForeName": "Nagib", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nanjo", "ForeName": "Yohei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sawada", "ForeName": "Hiroko", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohno", "ForeName": "Yoshihisa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Komatsu", "ForeName": "Setsuko", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Proteomics", "NlmUniqueID": "101092707", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9853"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Subcellular Fractions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20443193", "10.1002/pmic.201000180"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
