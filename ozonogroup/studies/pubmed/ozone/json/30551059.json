We investigated the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> and mortality in a Danish cohort of 49,564 individuals who were followed up from enrollment in 1993-1997 through 2015. Residential address history from 1979 onwards was combined with air pollution exposure obtained by the state-of-the-art, validated, THOR/AirGIS air pollution modelling system, and information on residential traffic noise exposure, lifestyle and socio-demography. We observed higher risks of all-cause as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality with higher long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, BC, and NO<sub>2</sub>. For PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CVD mortality, a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.13-1.47) per 5\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> was observed, and correspondingly HRs of 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05-1.27) and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04-1.17) were observed for BC (per 1\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and NO<sub>2</sub> (per 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), respectively. Adjustment for noise gave slightly lower estimates for the air pollutants and CVD mortality. Inverse relationships were observed for O<sub>3</sub>. None of the investigated air pollutants were related to risk of respiratory mortality. Stratified analyses suggested that the elevated risks of CVD and all-cause mortality in relation to long-term PM, NO<sub>2</sub> and BC exposure were restricted to males. This study supports a role of PM, BC, and NO<sub>2</sub> in all-cause and CVD mortality independent of road traffic noise exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.
