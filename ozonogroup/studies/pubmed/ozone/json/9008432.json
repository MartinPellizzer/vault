In contrast to this, it must be stressed that the admixtures and pollutants pertaining to air quality criteria belong to the atmosphere and therefore, of course, to the field of meteorology, and due to their possible effects also to human biometeorology. A normal weather forecast should include data concerning the concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and other substances. Biometeorological weather classifications should also include mention of air quality rather more than previously. For instance, the classification after Bucher used in Germany is referred to and supplemented with respect to air quality. Analogous relationships hold true for the global classification of climates. As an example, the well-known classification after Koeppen is supplemented according to air quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Institut f\u00fcr Allgemeine Okologie and Umweltschutz, Tharandt, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flemming", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biometeorol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374716", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9008432", "10.1007/BF01221391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
