Currently, due to lack of effective methods to remove it from the environmental water system, researchers are still exploring new ways to deal with tetracycline. In this work, we employed atmospheric-pressure non-thermal plasma (NTP) to treat tetracycline in water and investigated the involved degradation mechanism. The enhanced degradation efficiency was acquired and investigated, and the degradation mechanism by the plasma-generated active species were explored. The tetracycline degradation pathways via especially the interactions with plasma-generated hydroxyl radical and ozone were examined by virtue of UV spectroscopy, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), together with the assistance of theoretical simulations. Moreover, the toxicological evaluation of NTP treatment of tetracycline was also provided, which confirmed that the biological toxicity of tetracycline degradation products was negligible. Therefore, this work provides not only the effective way of treating antibiotics by engineered plasma technology, but also the insights into the mechanisms of degradation of antibiotics by NTP."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
