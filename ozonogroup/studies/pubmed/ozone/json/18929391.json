The oxidation process was investigated experimentally in a semibatch reactor. The results of the study indicated that the ozone/UV process was very effective in oxidizing TBF. tert-Butyl alcohol (TBA), hydroxy-iso-butyraldehyde (HiBA), acetone, formaldehyde, and formic acid were identified as major primary intermediates during the oxidation of TBF. About 90% organic carbon balance was obtained indicating that most reaction intermediates have been identified and quantified. Some of the primary intermediates were also oxidized in the ozone/UV system. Accordingly, HiBA, acetone, formaldehyde, and formic acid were the primary intermediates of TBA oxidation. The oxidation of acetone in the ozone/UV system generated formaldehyde, pyruvaldehyde, acetic acid, formic acid as primary intermediates. It was also observed that the reaction intermediates formed during the oxidation of TBF react well in the ozone/UV system and complete mineralization could be achieved by the process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-1324, United States. tgaroma@mail.sdsu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garoma", "ForeName": "Temesgen", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurol", "ForeName": "Mirat D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thotakura", "ForeName": "Lalitha", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osibodu", "ForeName": "Olufisayo", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Formates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tert-butyl formate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Formates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18929391", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.09.039", "S0045-6535(08)01197-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
