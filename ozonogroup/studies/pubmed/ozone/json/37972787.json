However, the persistence of organic micropollutants in inefficiently treated effluents can have detrimental effects depending on the scope of the reclaimed water usage. One example is the presence of sulfamethoxazole, a widely used antibiotic whose interference with the folate synthesis pathway negatively affects plants and microorganisms. The goal of this study is to assess the suitability of a non-thermal plasma-ozonation technique for the removal of the organic pollutant and reduction of its herbicidal effect. Fast sulfamethoxazole degradation was achieved with apparent reaction rate constants in the range 0.21-0.49\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>, depending on the initial concentration. The highest energy yield (64.5\u00a0g/kWh at 50\u00a0% removal) exceeds the values reported thus far in plasma degradation experiments. During treatment, 38 degradation intermediates were detected and identified, of which only 9 are still present after 60\u00a0min. The main reactive species that contribute to the degradation of sulfamethoxazole and its intermediate products were hydroxyl radicals and ozone, which led to the formation of several hydroxylated compounds, ring opening and fragmentation. The herbicidal effect of the target compound was eliminated with its removal, showing that the remanent intermediates do not retain phytotoxic properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
