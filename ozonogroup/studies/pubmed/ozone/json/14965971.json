Ozone was supplied either from 1900 until 0700 h (nighttime regime), from 0700 until 1900 h (daylight regime), or all day (24-h regime). By autumn, reductions in whole-plant biomass production, root/shoot biomass and stem weight/length ratios were evident in all three O(3) regimes. The reductions in cuttings receiving the 24-h O(3) treatment were about twofold larger than in cuttings receiving the daylight O(3) treatment. Stomata were open at night, and stomatal conductance was about 50% of its maximum daytime value. We calculated that the rate of O(3) uptake into leaves in the dark approached 4 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Whole-plant production and carbon allocation were more sensitive to O(3) during the night than during the day; however, O(3) exposure caused similar visible leaf injury in both of the 12-h regimes, although the leaves exposed to O(3) at night exhibited delayed O(3)-induced shedding. Overall, changes in production and carbon allocation were determined by the external O(3) dose rather than by the kind of O(3) exposure, indicating that, at the seasonal scale, the internal dose of ozone that was physiologically effective was a constant fraction of the external O(3) dose. We conclude that nighttime O(3) exposures should be included in the daily time period for determining critical concentrations of O(3) causing injury in trees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Forest, Snow and Landscape Research, Z\u00fcrcherstrasse 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf ZH, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matyssek", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcnthardt-Goerg", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maurer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14965971", "10.1093/treephys/15.3.159"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
