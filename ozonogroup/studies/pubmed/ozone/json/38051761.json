Exposure to UV light can be a cause of cataracts, one of the ocular diseases that may cause vision impairment. To date, lens replacement has been the only treatment available for cataracts. In our present study, we carried out an extensive examination of polyphenols as inhibitors for UV-induced aggregation of \u03b3D-crystallin. On exposure to UV-C light, \u03b3D-crystallin forms fibrils instead of amorphous aggregates. Various polyphenols were tested as inhibitors; out of them, quercetin, baicalein, and caffeic acid were found to be effective. As polyphenols are insoluble in water, nanoencapsulation was used to enhance their bioavailability. CS-TPP and CS-PLGA encapsulating systems were considered, as they form biodegradable nanocapsules. Out of three polyphenols (quercetin, baicalein, and caffeic acid), quercetin forms nanocarriers of smaller sizes, a must for crossing the retinal barrier. Quercetin nanocarriers were considered an effective system that could be used for therapeutic applications. For these nanocarriers, encapsulation efficiency and polyphenol release kinetics were studied. CS-PLGA NPs were found to have a better loading efficiency for quercetin than CS-TPP NPs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Hauzkhas, Delhi New Delhi 110016, India."}], "LastName": "Goswami", "ForeName": "Vishakha", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Hauzkhas, Delhi New Delhi 110016, India."}], "LastName": "Tomar", "ForeName": "Vijay Raj", "Initials": "VR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Hauzkhas, Delhi New Delhi 110016, India."}], "LastName": "Yashika"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4908-8205"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Hauzkhas, Delhi New Delhi 110016, India."}], "LastName": "Deep", "ForeName": "Shashank", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Crystallins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Crystallins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cataract"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38051761", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c01910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
