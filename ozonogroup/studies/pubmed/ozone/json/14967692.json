Ranges of O(3) and SAR spanned ambient levels found in the southern USA. Effects of O(3) on leaf-level and whole-plant gas exchange were characterized for a single measurement period immediately before the third summer of exposure. Decreased photosynthesis rates were attributed to O(3), but not SAR. Stomatal conductance decreased in response to O(3) exposure, and either increased or was unaffected by SAR. Increased internal CO(2) concentration (c(i)) in response to O(3) treatment indicated a greater effect of O(3) on photosynthetic capacity than stomatal conductance. Whole-seedling gas exchange characteristics indicated that whole-seedling carbon assimilation was more severely affected by O(3) than was evident from leaf-level gas exchange characteristics. Seedlings exposed to O(3) retained fewer flushes than seedlings grown in charcoal-filtered air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Science, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, Texas A&M University System, College Station, Texas 77843-2135, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flagler", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lock", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elsik", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14967692", "10.1093/treephys/14.4.361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
