To study the composition characteristics and sources of VOCs in Lianyungang City, four national control sites were selected to conduct VOCs sampling and analysis on typical days in spring, summer, and autumn. Concentrations of VOCs, the effects of different components of VOCs on ozone formation were quantified, and the sources of VOCs were analyzed using the Positive Matrix Factorization model. The VOC concentrations were in the range of 27.46\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>-40.52\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in spring, 45.79\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>-53.45\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in summer, and 38.84\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>-46.66\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> in autumn. Concentrations of oxygenated compounds accounted for 41%-48% of all measured VOCs. VOC species with higher concentrations were acetone, acrolein, and propionaldehyde, and the concentration of isoprene was higher in summer. Generally, VOC concentrations were higher at 09:00 than at 13:00 when acrolein, ethylene, and dichloromethane concentrations changed greatly. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of oxygenated compounds was the highest, followed by aromatics and alkenes, and the OFP of alkanes was the smallest. The VOC species with higher OFP were acrolein, propylene, and ethylene. The main sources of VOCs in Lianyungang were industry (49%), solvent usage (23%), transportation (14%), paint usage (10%), and natural sources (4%). The results suggest further investigating the oxygenated compounds with higher concentrations and higher OFP in Lianyungang City, and studying the impacts of industrial sources on VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jin-Meng", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ti-Jian", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lianyungang Ecology and Environment Agency, Lianyungang 222001, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qiu-Tong", "Initials": "QT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lianyungang Ecology and Environment Agency, Lianyungang 222001, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Li-Wen", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cong-Wu", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yun-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33124273", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201912209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
