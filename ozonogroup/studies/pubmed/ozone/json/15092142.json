One of the critically important decisions underlying these studies has been the choice of the control or reference O(3) exposure to which all other treatments are compared. The issue of the control or reference O(3) exposure is a complex one. Does a single ambient control or reference O(3) exposure exist? The approach taken in this paper is to examine the O(3) concentrations in the 'clean troposphere.' One must ask what a clean troposphere is and whether there are any geographic locations in the world today that are totally free of human influences. Data on photochemical oxidants from Fortress Mountain, Alberta, Canada, are examined. A comparison of these data with air quality data from other locations in North America is used to examine the design of vegetation response studies. The need for integrated research design, execution, and evaluation is stressed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kananaskis Centre for Environmental Research, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Legge", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nosal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McVehil", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krupa", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092142", "10.1016/0269-7491(91)90087-d", "026974919190087D"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
