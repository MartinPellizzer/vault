The device is being marketed as a negative ion generator that purifies the air. However, it also produces ozone within the person's immediate breathing zone. In order to assess worst-case potential human exposure to ozone at the mouth and nose, we measured ozone concentrations in separate tests at 1, 3, 5, and 6 in. above each of two PAPs in a closed office. One PAP was new, and one had been used slightly for 3 months. Temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, room ozone concentration, and outdoor ozone concentration also were measured concurrently during the tests. Average ozone levels measured directly above the individual PAPs ranged from 65-71 ppb at 6 in. above the device to 268-389 ppb at 1 in. above the device. Ozone emission rates from the PAPs were estimated to be 1.7-1.9 microg/minute. When house dust was sprinkled on the top grid of the PAPs, one showed an initial peak of 522 ppb ozone at 1 in., and then returned to the 200-400 ppb range. Room ozone levels increased by only 0-5 ppb during the tests. Even when two PAPs were left operating over a weekend, room ozone levels did not noticeably increase beyond background room ozone levels. These results indicate that this \"PAP,\" even without significant background ozone, can potentially elevate the user's exposures to ozone levels greater than the health-based air quality standards for outdoor air in California (0.09 ppm, 1-hour average) and the United States (0.08 ppm, 8-hour average)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "California Air Resources Board, California Environmental Protection Agency, Sacramento, USA. tphillip@arb.ca.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bloudoff", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jenkins", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stroud", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9111438", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4245"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Protective Devices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10638845", "10.1038/sj.jea.7500005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
