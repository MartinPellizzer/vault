We analysed associations between low-level air pollution and mortality within the multicentre study Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE).", "In this multicentre longitudinal study, we analysed seven population-based cohorts of adults (age \u226530 years) within ELAPSE, from Belgium, Denmark, England, the Netherlands, Norway, Rome (Italy), and Switzerland (enrolled in 2000-11; follow-up until 2011-17). Mortality registries were used to extract the underlying cause of death for deceased individuals. Annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), black carbon, and tropospheric warm-season ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from Europe-wide land use regression models at 100 m spatial resolution were assigned to baseline residential addresses. We applied cohort-specific Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for area-level and individual-level covariates to evaluate associations with non-accidental mortality, as the main outcome, and with cardiovascular, non-malignant respiratory, and lung cancer mortality. Subset analyses of participants living at low pollutant concentrations (as per predefined values) and natural splines were used to investigate the concentration-response function. Cohort-specific effect estimates were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis.", "We analysed 28\u2008153\u2008138 participants contributing 257\u2008859\u2008621 person-years of observation, during which 3\u2008593\u2008741 deaths from non-accidental causes occurred. We found significant positive associations between non-accidental mortality and PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and black carbon, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1\u00b7053 (95% CI 1\u00b7021-1\u00b7085) per 5 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>, 1\u00b7044 (1\u00b7019-1\u00b7069) per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> NO<sub>2</sub>, and 1\u00b7039 (1\u00b7018-1\u00b7059) per 0\u00b75\u2008\u00d7\u200810<sup>-5</sup>/m black carbon. Associations with PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and black carbon were slightly weaker for cardiovascular mortality, similar for non-malignant respiratory mortality, and stronger for lung cancer mortality. Warm-season O<sub>3</sub> was negatively associated with both non-accidental and cause-specific mortality. Associations were stronger at low concentrations: HRs for non-accidental mortality at concentrations lower than the WHO 2005 air quality guideline values for PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> (10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and NO<sub>2</sub> (40 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) were 1\u00b7078 (1\u00b7046-1\u00b7111) per 5 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> and 1\u00b7049 (1\u00b7024-1\u00b7075) per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> NO<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, the association between black carbon and non-accidental mortality was highest at low concentrations, with a HR of 1\u00b7061 (1\u00b7032-1\u00b7092) for exposure lower than 1\u00b75\u00d7\u200810<sup>-5</sup>/m, and 1\u00b7081 (0\u00b7966-1\u00b7210) for exposure lower than 1\u00b70\u00d7\u200810<sup>-5</sup>/m.", "Long-term exposure to concentrations of PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> lower than current annual limit values was associated with non-accidental, cardiovascular, non-malignant respiratory, and lung cancer mortality in seven large European cohorts. Continuing research on the effects of low concentrations of air pollutants is expected to further inform the process of setting air quality standards in Europe and other global regions.", "Health Effects Institute."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
