Based on the chamber experiment, three clones with intermediate sensitivity to O3 were selected for a free-air O3 enrichment experiment in which plants were exposed for 2 months to either ambient air (control) or air containing 1.3 x the ambient O3 concentration. We measured stem height and radial growth, number of leaves, dry mass and relative growth rate of leaves, stem and roots, visible leaf injuries, net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of the clones. There was high clonal variation in susceptibility to O3 in the chamber experiment, indicated by foliar injuries and differential reductions in growth and net photosynthesis. In the free-air O3 enrichment experiment, ozone caused a shift in resource allocation toward stem height growth, thereby altering the shoot to root balance. In both experiments, low O3 concentrations tended to stimulate growth of most clones, whereas 100 and 150 ppb O3 in the chamber experiment impaired growth of most clones. However, growth of the most O3-tolerant clone was not significantly affected by any O3 treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, POB 1627, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oksanen", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amores", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kokko", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amores", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00e4renlampi", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Salicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11600339", "10.1093/treephys/21.16.1171"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
