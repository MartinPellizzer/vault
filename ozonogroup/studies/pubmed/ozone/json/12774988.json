The study was based on data generated by a network of measuring stations distributed throughout the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Area, in regions with different characteristics of traffic and economic activities. The combined application of principal component analysis and clustering techniques to data collected from 1997 until 2000 has led to the identification of implicit relationships between variables that have been associated with dominant processes related to O3 formation in different locations. Similarities between different regions of the city have also been detected and associated with local characteristics. The results indicate that the application of such statistical techniques to data collected in large urban areas enables the grouping of different regions according to their behavior in terms of O3 levels, as well as the identification of dominant processes in each group. These techniques are thus important in the planning of air pollution policies, especially in the case of O3, a pollutant that is not directly related to pollution levels alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering Department, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. guardani@usp.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guardani", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aguiar", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nascimento", "ForeName": "Claudio A O", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lacava", "ForeName": "Carlos I V", "Initials": "CI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yanagi", "ForeName": "Yoshio", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12774988", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466188"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
