Of particular interest are the roles IO plays in the formation of new particles in coastal marine environments and in depletion episodes of ozone and mercury in the Arctic polar spring. This paper describes a ground-based instrument that measures IO at mixing ratios less than one part in 10(12). The IO radical is measured by detecting laser-induced fluorescence at wavelengths longer that 500 nm. Tunable visible light is used to pump the A(2)\u03a03/2 (v(') = 2) \u2190 X(2)\u03a03/2 (v(\u2033) = 0) transition of IO near 445 nm. The laser light is produced by a solid-state, Nd:YAG-pumped Ti:Sapphire laser at 5 kHz repetition rate. The laser-induced fluorescence instrument performs reliably with very high signal-to-noise ratios (>10) achieved in short integration times (<1 min). The observations from a validation deployment to the Shoals Marine Lab on Appledore Island, ME are presented and are broadly consistent with in situ observations from European Coastal Sites. Mixing ratios ranged from the instrumental detection limit (<1 pptv) to 10 pptv. These data represent the first in situ point measurements of IO in North America."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Thurlow", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Co", "ForeName": "D T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "O'Brien", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Hannun", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Lapson", "ForeName": "L B", "Initials": "LB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Hanisco", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."}], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Rev Sci Instrum", "NlmUniqueID": "0405571", "ISSNLinking": "0034-6748"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iodine Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iodine Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lasers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24784629", "10.1063/1.4869857"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
