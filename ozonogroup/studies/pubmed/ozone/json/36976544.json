We assessed daily lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] and forced vital capacity [FVC]), prior-day personal pollutant exposure measured by portable air quality monitors (fine particulate matter [PM<sub>2.5</sub>] nitrogen oxide [NO<sub>2</sub>], and ozone [O<sub>3</sub>]), and daily step count. We constructed multi-level linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts for person and person-observation month, adjusting for demographic/seasonal covariates to test if step count was associated with daily pollution exposure, and if associations between prior-day pollution and lung function differed based on prior-day step count. Where effect modification was found, we performed stratified analyses by tertile of step count.", "Higher daily step count was associated with higher same-day personal exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> but not NO<sub>2</sub>. Each interquartile range (IQR) increment in step count was associated with 0.97 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> (95%CI: 0.30, 1.64) higher exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 0.15 parts per billion (95% CI: -0.05, 0.35) higher exposure to O<sub>3</sub> in adjusted models. We observed an interaction between prior-day NO<sub>2</sub> and step count on FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC (P<sub>interaction</sub><0.05) in which the negative associations between NO<sub>2</sub> and lung function were reduced or absent at higher levels of daily activity. For example, FEV<sub>1</sub> was 28.5mL (95%CI: -41.0, -15.9) lower per IQR of NO<sub>2</sub> in the lowest tertile of step count, but there was no association in the highest tertile of step count (-1.6mL, 95% CI: -18.4, 15.2).", "Higher physical activity was associated with modestly higher daily exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and may attenuate the association between NO<sub>2</sub> exposure and lung function."], "CopyrightInformation": "JCOPDF \u00a9 2023."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kelly", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."}], "LastName": "Aglan", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harvard College, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States."}], "LastName": "Purcell", "ForeName": "Alexandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."}], "LastName": "Nurhussien", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.
