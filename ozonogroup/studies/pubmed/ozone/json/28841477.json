The structural regularity and the valence states of the metal species were measured by X-ray diffractometer and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The resultant bimetallic Co-Mn-MCM-41 catalyst was tested for the degradation of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) via a catalytic ozonation mechanism, demonstrating that the catalytic properties of Co-Mn-MCM-41 catalyst significantly accelerated the ozonation process. Total organic carbon (TOC) and DMP removal efficiency reached 94% and 99.7% at 15min under the optimal conditions. The oxidation pathways were proposed after identifying the intermediate products from ozonation using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The enhanced catalytic reactivity was attributed to the highly-dispersive cobalt and manganese species in MCM-41 scaffolds, which promoted the ozone decomposition and hydroxyl radicals' generation in catalytic ozonation and accelerated the degradation of DMP. Bimetallic Co-Mn-MCM-41 catalyst remained stable in mild acidic conditions and continued to show high activity after repeated runs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
