The initial phase of the work includes analysis of recent literature relating to the performance of combined approach based on hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) for degradation of different pollutants followed by a detailed investigation into degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP). The degradation of the priority pollutant, 2,4,6-TCP, using combination of HC based on slit-venturi used as the cavitating device, ozone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been investigated. The effect of operating pressure (2-5bar) and initial pH (3-11) have been investigated for the degradation using only HC. The degradation using only ozone (100-400mg/h) and only H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has also been studied. The efficacy of the combined operation of HC+O<sub>3</sub> at different ozone flow rates (100-400mg/h) and the combined operation of HC+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at different loadings of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (2,4,6-TCP:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as 1:1-1:7) have been subsequently investigated. The degradation efficacy has also been established for the combined treatment strategies of O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HC+O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the optimum conditions of temperature as 30\u00b0C, inlet pressure of 4bar and initial pH of 7. Extent of 2,4,6-TCP degradation, TOC and COD removal obtained for HC+O<sub>3</sub> process were 97.1%, 94.4% and 78.5% respectively whereas for O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process, the values were 95.5%, 94.8% and 76.2% and for HC+O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process the extent of reduction were 100%, 95.6% and 80.9% in the same order. The combined treatment approach as HC+O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was established as the most efficient approach for complete removal of 2,4,6-TCP with near complete TOC removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
