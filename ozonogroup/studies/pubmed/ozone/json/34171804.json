The present study compares the temporal and spatial distributions of Total Column Ozone (TCO) over the Indian sub-continent retrieved from a geostationary Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The INSAT-3D TCO values are also evaluated against the Dobson spectrophotometer observations at two locations. The inter-comparison results reveal a good correlation of 0.8, the bias of -5 DU, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 15 DU approximately between the TCO retrieved from INSAT-3D and AIRS. The lowest RMSE and highest correlation coefficient were found in the pre-monsoon season. The INSAT-3D and AIRS show reasonable agreement with the RMSE varying between 10 and 30 DU. On the other hand, evaluation of the INSAT-3D TCO with the ground-based observations from Dobson spectrophotometers located at New Delhi and Varanasi showed fair agreement with a maximum monthly mean correlation coefficient of 0.68 and 0.76, respectively, and RMSE varying from 11 to 16 DU for both the stations. The seasonal distribution of TCO and its variation over the Indian region has also been studied using INSAT-3D and AIRS data. The analysis exhibits strong seasonal variations, with higher values in pre-monsoon season and minimum values in winter season. The noticeable seasonal variability of TCO can be attributed to complex combination of photochemical and dynamical processes in the troposphere and stratosphere. The main objectives of the study are to compare the INSAT-3D TCO with two independent ground-based Dobson spectrophotometer observations and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
