Athletes and physically active individuals are at increased risk of exposure to agents that damage the epithelial barriers and microbiome, and their extreme physical exercise exerts stress on many organs, resulting in tissue damage and inflammation. Epithelial barrier-damaging substances include surfactants and enzymes in cleaning products, laundry and dishwasher detergents, chlorine in swimming pools, microplastics, air pollutants such as ozone, particulate matter, and diesel exhaust. Athletes' high-calorie diet often relies on processed foods that may contain food emulsifiers and other additives that may cause epithelial barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis. The type of the material used in the sport equipment and clothing and their extensive exposure may increase the inflammatory effects. Excessive travel-related stress, sleep disturbances and different food and microbe exposure may represent additional factors. Here, we review the detrimental impact of toxic agents on epithelial barriers and microbiome; bring a new perspective on the factors affecting the health and performance of athletes and physically active individuals."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
