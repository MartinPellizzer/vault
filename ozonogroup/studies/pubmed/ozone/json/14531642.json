An ozone-oxygen mixture was used to provoke an oxygen stress. To measure the Se-effect mice were gavaged with sodium selenite. GSH-Px activity and total glutathione concentrations were determined in serum and in the postnuclear fraction of liver and lungs. Additionally glutathione concentrations were determined in whole blood. Both ozone and selenium, administered separately, reduced GSH-Px activity in lungs of 6-month-old animals, while in young mice an opposite effect of Se was observed. Ozone administered jointly with Se did not influence GSH-Px activity in 6-month-old mice, while in young, 3-month-old mice, a stimulatory effect in lungs was observed. There were no significant changes in GSH-Px activity in the liver of 6-month-old mice, but the stimulatory effect occurred in young mice treated with Se and Se & ozone jointly. In young mice, ozone (also ozone with Se) augmented glutathione concentrations. The response to ozone and selenium strictly depended on age and the antagonism between selenium and ozone was observed only in a few cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Silesia, Department of Animal Physiology & Ecotoxicology, Katowice, Poland. dolezych@us.edu.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dolezych", "ForeName": "Bogdan", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Szulinska", "ForeName": "Elzbieta", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Trace Elem Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9508274", "ISSNLinking": "0946-672X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14531642", "10.1016/S0946-672X(03)80009-3", "S0946-672X(03)80009-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
