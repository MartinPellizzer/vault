Three ADS events were observed during the periods of April 10-12, 13-14, and 25-26. Average concentration levels of daytime OH and nighttime NO3 on Jeju Island during the ADS period were estimated to be about 1x10(6) and 2x10(8) moleculescm(-3) ( approximately 9 pptv), respectively. OH levels during the ADS period were lower than those during the non-Asian-dust-storm (NADS) period by a factor of 1.5. This was likely to result from higher CO levels and the significant loading of dust particles, reducing the photolysis frequencies of ozone. Decreases in NO3 levels during the ADS period was likely to be determined mainly by the enhancement of the N2O5 heterogeneous reaction on dust aerosol surfaces. Averaged over 24 h, the reaction between HO2 and NO was the most important source of OH during the study period, followed by ozone photolysis, which contributed more than 95% of the total source. The reactions with CO, NO2, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) during the study period were major sinks for OH. The reaction of N2O5 on aerosol surfaces was a more important sink for nighttime NO3 during the ADS due to the significant loading of dust particles. The reaction of NO3 with NMHCs and the gas-phase reaction of N2O5 with water vapor were both significant loss mechanisms during the study period, especially during the NADS. However, dry deposition of these oxidized nitrogen species and a heterogeneous reaction of NO3 were of no importance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Dong-Eui University, Busanjingu Gayadong San 24, Busan 614-714, South Korea. zangho@dongeui.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shon", "ForeName": "Zang-Ho", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ki-Hyun", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bower", "ForeName": "Keith N", "Initials": "KN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Gangwoong", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jiyoung", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15050810", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2003.10.003", "S0045-6535(03)00980-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
