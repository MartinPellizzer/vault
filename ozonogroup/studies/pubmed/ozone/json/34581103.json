The results showed that the O<sub>3</sub> pollution level in April increased year by year, and diurnal variations showed a unimodal distribution. When the ambient temperature was more than 20\u2103, the wind speed was between 1 and 1.5 m\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, and the relative humidity was less than 65%, the probability of O<sub>3</sub> pollution occurring in April was more than 80%. In April 2018, the average concentrations of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and VOCs during O<sub>3</sub> pollution days were 2.3-times and 2-times higher than non-pollution days. Furthermore, an OBM method was used to calculate the RIR values of different ozone precursors. This showed that the RIR values of anthropogenic VOCs, CO, biogenic VOCs, and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> for ozone were 2.4, 0.87, 0.06, and -2.6, respectively, indicating that O<sub>3</sub> formation in Chengdu was generally VOC-limited. The RIR values of the VOC species showed that <i>m/p</i>-xylene, ethylene, trans-2-butane, propylene, <i>o</i>-xylene, toluene, acetone, isoprene, isopentane, and <i>n</i>-butane were the key active VOC species of ozone formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Chen-Xi", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hui", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34581103", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202012312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
