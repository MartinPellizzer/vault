This three-atom molecule in the ozone-layer, is healing the earth's ecosystem by protecting it from dangerous rays of the sun. Until this molecule is in the stratosphere, it would support the natural order of the life; but, when it appears in our environment, damages will begin against us. In this project, we have tried to find a new way for beaconing ozone species in our environment via physical adsorption by the C<sub>20</sub> fullerene and graphene segment as a sensor. To find the selectivity of this nano-sized segment in sensing ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), compared to the usual chemically active gasses of the troposphere like O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO, the density of state (DOS) plots were analyzed, for each interacting species. The results showed that ozone could significantly change the electrical conductivity of C<sub>20</sub> fullerene, for each adsorption step. Thus, this fullerene could clearly sense ozone in different adsorption steps; while, the graphene segment could do this only at the second step adsorption (/\u0394E<sub>g-B</sub>/=0.016eV) (at the first adsorption step the /\u0394E<sub>g-A</sub>/ is 0.00eV)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
