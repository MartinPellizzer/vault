We previously described a population of smokers with a limited smoking history that had enhanced responsiveness to brief O3 boluses and aimed to determine if responsiveness to continuous exposure was also enhanced. Thirty smokers (19M, 11F, 24\u00b14 years, 6\u00b14 total years smoking,4\u00b12 packs/week) and 30 non-smokers (17M, 13F, 25\u00b16 years) exercised for 1h on a cycle ergometer while breathing 0.30ppm O3. Smokers and non-smokers were equally responsive in terms of FEV1 (-9.5\u00b11.8% vs -8.7\u00b11.9%). Smokers alone were responsive in terms of VD (-6.1\u00b11.2%) and SN (9.1\u00b13.4%). There was no difference in total delivered dose. Dead space ventilation (VD/VT) was not initially different between the two groups, but increased in the non-smokers (16.4\u00b12.8%) during the exposure, suggesting that the inhaled dose may be distributed more peripherally in smokers. We also conclude that these cigarette smokers retain their airway responsiveness to O3 and, uniquely, experience changes in VD that lead to heterogeneity in airway morphometry and an increase in SN."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.
