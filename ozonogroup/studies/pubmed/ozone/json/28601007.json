In this paper, some ICM were proven to be strongly correlated with I-DBPs through investigation of five ICM and five iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) in surface water and two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) of the Yangtze River Delta, China. The total ICM concentrations in Taihu Lake and the Huangpu River ranged from 88.7 to 131\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and 102-252\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. While the total I-THM concentrations ranged from 128 to 967\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in Taihu Lake and 267-680\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in the Huangpu River. Iohexol, the dominant ICM, showed significant positive correlation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with CHClI<sub>2</sub> in Taihu Lake. Iopamidol and iomeprol correlated positively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with some I-THMs in the Huangpu River. The observed pronounced correlations between ICM and I-THMs indicated that ICM play an important role in the formation of I-THMs in a real aquatic environment. Characteristics of the I-THM species distributions indicated that I-THMs may be transformed by natural conditions. Both DWTPs showed negligible removal efficiencies for total ICM (<20%). Strikingly high concentrations of total I-THMs were observed in the finished water (2848\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in conventional DWTP and 356\u00a0ng\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in advanced DWTP). Obvious transformation of ICM to I-THMs was observed during the chlorination and ozonization processes in DWTPs. We suggest that ICM is an important source for I-DBP formation in the real aquatic environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
