In the absence of ozone, EDU-treated plants were found to emit the same amount of C(2)H(4) as plants not treated with EDU. Based on this evidence, EDU-induced tolerance to ozone could not have been attributed to the prevention of an interaction between ethylene and ozone (sensu Mehlhorn and Wellburn). In the presence of ozone, EDU-treated plants did not emit the burst of C(2)H(4) that normally occurs (sensu Craker), extending the observation that EDU-treated plants do not exhibit the adverse physiological responses normally caused by ozone. The classic C(2)H(4) biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) did not prevent ozone phytotoxicity, although it significantly reduced ethylene emission from the ozonated tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology and the Department of Plant Pathology, Cook College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zilinskas", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Greenhalgh-Weidman", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brennan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092264", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90086-r", "0269-7491(90)90086-R"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
