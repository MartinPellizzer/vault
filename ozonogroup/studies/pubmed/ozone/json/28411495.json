The analysis consisted of 117 trials representing 20 peer-reviewed articles and 16 unpublished trials. Relative to non-mycorrhizal controls, AM inoculation did not significantly alter plant growth (shoot biomass, root biomass, total biomass and plant height) when O<sub>3</sub> concentration was less than 80\u00a0ppb, but at concentrations above 80\u00a0ppb symbiosis was associated with increases of 68% in shoot biomass and 131% in root biomass. AM effects on plant growth were affected by the duration of O<sub>3</sub> exposure but did not differ much with AM fungi taxa or plant type. AM symbiosis has also led to higher yields under O<sub>3</sub> stress, relative to the non-mycorrhizal plants, and the AM effects have been more pronounced as O<sub>3</sub> concentration increases. As with biomass, AM effects on yield have been affected by the duration of O<sub>3</sub> exposure, with the greatest increase (100%) occurring at 61-90\u00a0d. AM-induced promotion of yield differed with fungal species but not with plant type or other abiotic stress. Colonization of roots by AM fungi has been negatively affected by elevated O<sub>3</sub> compared to ambient O<sub>3</sub>; total mycorrhizal colonization rate (MCR), arbuscular MCR, vesicular MCR and hyphal coil MCR declined as O<sub>3</sub> levels rose. AM colonization rates were affected by duration of O<sub>3</sub> exposure, plant type, AM fungal taxa and other concurrent stresses in most cases. The analysis showed that AM inoculation has the potential to ameliorate detrimental effects of elevated O<sub>3</sub> on plant growth and productivity, despite colonization rates being negatively affected by elevated O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
