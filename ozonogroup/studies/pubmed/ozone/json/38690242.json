Early treatment of OLP can dramatically reduce the risk of further development, which in turn reduces the risk of developing cancer. Numerous methods can be used to treat OLP. Since the significance of ozone in treating this disease is still uncertain. This systematic review was conducted based on english databases, including PUBMED, SCOPUS, Embase, Ovid, and Journal of Web up to July 2022. We used the search phrases \"ozone,\" \"ozone in the treatment of oral lichen planus,\" \"oral lichen planus,\" and \"ozone therapy.\" Finally, five papers were selected for qualitative analysis. This review included a total of five papers, four of which were clinical trials and one was a longitudinal study. All studies included the erosive form of OLP, also ozone therapy was applied to patients who did not respond to conventional treatment. Ozone showed significant therapeutic effects in terms of reduction in pain and size of the lesion. The signs and symptoms associated with OLP such as burning sensation, lesion size, and scarring all considerably improved with ozone therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2024 National Journal of Maxillofacial Surgery."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Ajay", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Adit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sah", "ForeName": "Neha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Teerthanker Mahaveer Dental College and Research Centre, Muradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sah", "ForeName": "Sonam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "Vinayalekshmy I N", "Initials": "VIN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Dental College Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Aruna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dental Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Akhilesh Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Natl J Maxillofac Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101578767", "ISSNLinking": "0975-5950"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sarode SC, Sarode GS, Tupkari JV.
