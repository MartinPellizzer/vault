We aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and relationships between ozone levels and temperature in eastern China using observation-based ozone data from 418 air quality monitoring stations and temperature data from ERA5. The summer maximum temperature and annual ozone concentration in eastern China increased significantly between 2015 and 2022, with increases rate of 10% and 2.84\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The baseline ozone concentration was increasing over time. The average difference in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration in spring, summer, and autumn decreased, with more ozone pollution spreading into spring and autumn, indicating a trend of prolonging the ozone season. During the June-July-August (JJA) period of 2015-2022, heatwaves increased significantly in eastern China. The frequency of heatwave events >10 days played a vital role in exacerbating ozone pollution. During the JJA period, the increase rate in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration was 9.31\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> during heatwave periods, significantly higher than that during non-heatwave periods (4.01\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). The correlation between MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration and temperature was as high as 0.99, indicating that temperature was vital in ozone formation during the JJA period in eastern China. This study suggests that more stringent actions are needed to control ozone-precursor compounds during frequent summertime heatwaves in eastern China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
