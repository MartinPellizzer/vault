Male Fischer 344 rats were given 10 mmol/kg HCFC-132b dissolved in corn oil by intraperitoneal injection. An NMR assay for covalent binding of HCFC-132b metabolites to liver proteins was negative, whereas binding was observed in halothane-treated rats. Total urinary metabolites excreted by rats given HCFC-132b during the first 24 h amounted to 1.8 +/- 0.1% of the injected dose, as determined by 19F NMR. During the first 6 h, metabolites of HCFC-132b corresponding to 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroethyl glucuronide, unknown metabolite A, chlorodifluoroacetic acid, and chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate [both free and conjugated (unknown metabolite B)] were excreted in urine in the approximate ratio 100:9:3:7, respectively. Metabolite A is apparently an O-conjugate of 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroethanol; unconjugated 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroethanol was not detected in urine. The 19F NMR spectrum of metabolite B indicates the formation of a hemiacetal of chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde. Repeated exposure of rats to HCFC-132b significantly increased both the rate of chlorodifluoroacetic acid excretion and the relative fraction of the HCFC-132b dose excreted as chlorodifluoroacetic acid in urine. Incubation of HCFC-132b with rat hepatic microsomes yielded chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate as the only fluorinated product. The in vitro metabolism of HCFC-132b was increased in microsomes from pyridine-treated rats as compared with control rats, and HCFC-132b metabolism was inhibited by p-nitrophenol, indicating that the cytochrome P-450 isoform IIE1 is largely responsible for the initial hydroxylation of HCFC-132b."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Sciences Center, University of Rochester School of Medicine, New York 14642."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harris", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anders", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES05407", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES07026", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chem Res Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807448", "ISSNLinking": "0893-228X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1649-08-7", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "284SYP0193", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76-04-0", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorodifluoroacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "811-96-1", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GO1N1ZPR3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons, Ethane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1782346", "10.1021/tx00020a009"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
