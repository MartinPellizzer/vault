Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is applied to deactivate <i>Bacillus</i> <i>subtilis</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> , respectively, and disinfection efficiency is experimentally evaluated in this study. Tests are conducted with different working gases to investigate their effects on disinfection. Results show that Ar plasma diluted with 25% O<sub>2</sub> enhances the germicidal effects to5.9 and 6.9 (log reduction) for <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>E. coli</i>, respectively, and OES results show that active Ar and O species play important roles to weaken cell wall of microbes and further disinfect <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i>. Analysis of protein and total sugar release indicates that active species such as ozone, NO and Ar* produced by plasma result in hydrolysis of the cell. In the meantime, charged particles produced by plasma would affect the amount of sugar released, resulting in different germicidal effects. Overall, plasma can disinfect microorganisms mainly via the generation of oxidising agents including ozone, NO and UV with a comparatively short treatment period, which is typically less than 5\u2005min."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "YuJung", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Division, Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Longtan, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "YungChih", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "WeiChieh", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "BaoShun", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Moo Been", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30758245", "10.1080/09593330.2019.1583289"]}}]}
