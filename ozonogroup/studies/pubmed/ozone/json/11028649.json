The aim of the present study was to assess such associations among elderly (> or =65 yrs) residents of Mexico City. Ambient air pollution data were provided by the Metropolitan Monitoring Network. During the study period, the average daily PM10 ranged 23.4-175.3 microg x m(-3), and ozone 1 h daily maximums ranged 39.4-216.7 ppb. Information was compiled on the primary and underlying causes of death. The analyses were conducted separately according to place of death (within or out of a hospital unit) using time-series methodology. The total number of deaths from all respiratory causes and mortality for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) were significantly related to PM10 over different lags: an increase of 10 microg x m(-3) was related to a 2.9% (95% (CI): 0.9-4.9%) increase and to a 4.1% (95% CI: 1.3%-6.9%) increase with a 3-day lag when death occurred out of medical units, respectively. For deaths occurring in medical units, a longer lag and smaller risk estimate was observed. An interactive effect between PM10 and ozone was detected. This study confirms that there is an important impact of PM10 on respiratory morbidity among elderly subjects. It also indicates that accounting for primary and underlying causes of death, and considering place of death may reduce misclassification and provide more accurate estimates of the adverse impact of PM10 on mortality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Nacional de Salud P\u00fablica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "T\u00e9llez-Rojo", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romieu", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruiz-Velasco", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lezana", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Avila", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Eur Respir J. 2001 May;17(5):1055-6. doi: 10.1183/09031936.01.17510540", "PMID": "11488312"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospital Units"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases, Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11028649", "10.1034/j.1399-3003.2000.016003391.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
