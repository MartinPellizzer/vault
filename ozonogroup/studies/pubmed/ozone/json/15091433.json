Results for 7-day mean ambient O(3) concentrations from the passive samplers were compared to results from a co-located continuous ultraviolet photometric O(3) analyzer both in NH and VT. Although the size of the data set was small, agreement through simple linear regression between mean 7-day O(3) concentrations determined by the continuous monitors, and those obtained from the passive samplers was generally very good (adjusted R(2) = 0.759; p = 0.0003). Overall, excluding the one outlier value, any observed differences in the results obtained by the two methods when comparing co-located passive samplers to the continuous monitor within a given study location, appeared to be solely due to experimental error."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Massachusetts, Fernald Hall, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003-2420, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manning", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krupa", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergweiler", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "K I", "Initials": "KI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091433", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00075-5", "0269749195000755"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
