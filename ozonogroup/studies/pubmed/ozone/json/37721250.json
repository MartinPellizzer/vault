This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ozonated autohemotherapy (O<sub>3</sub>-AHT) combined with pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of thoracic PHN in older adults. The medical records of patients with thoracic PHN aged 65 years and older from June 2018 until March 2021 in Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital were reviewed. They were assigned into two groups: PRF alone (PRF group, n = 107) and PRF combined with O<sub>3</sub>-AHT (PRF + O<sub>3</sub>-AHT group, n = 109). Visual Analogue Scale for pain was evaluated at pre-treatment, 1 day, 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Quality of life and sleep quality were assessed using Short-Form 36 Health Survey and Athens Insomnia Scale at pre-treatment and 6 months post-treatment, respectively. The median age of patients in the PRF and PRF + O<sub>3</sub>-AHT groups were 69 (67-73) years and 68 (67-72) years, respectively. The former included 62 females and the latter included 51 females. Compared with pre-treatment, the Visual Analogue Scale scores of two groups declined at post-treatment. Patients in the PRF + O<sub>3</sub>-AHT group showed obviously lower Visual Analogue Scale scores compared with those in the PRF group at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment and they had earlier withdrawal time for drugs. However, dizziness, tachycardia, sleepiness, and nausea were presented after combination therapy. These symptoms resolved spontaneously after a period of rest. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub>-AHT combined with PRF was associated with a significant decrease in the Athens Insomnia Scale score and with a significant improvement in every dimension of the Short-Form 36 Health Survey. To conclude, O<sub>3</sub>-AHT combined with PRF is an effective way to relieve thoracic PHN in older patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi-Rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain, Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital, Dongying, Shangdong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Wei-Peng", "Initials": "WP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain, Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital, Dongying, Shangdong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain, Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital, Dongying, Shangdong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Yun-Chao", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain, Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital, Dongying, Shangdong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Guan-Rong", "Initials": "GR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Med Gas Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101564536", "ISSNLinking": "2045-9912"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neuralgia, Postherpetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}], "CoiStatement": "\n<b>Conflicts of interest</b>\n.
