A nanoporous MCM-48 material with a high specific surface area was used as the support for the catalytic oxidation for the first time. Mn, which has high activity at a low temperature, was used as the metal catalyst. To examine the effect of the Mn precursor, MCM-48 was impregnated with two different Mn precursors: Mn acetate and Mn nitrate. The characteristics of the synthesized catalysts were analyzed by Brunauer Emmett Teller surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction. MCM-48 impregnated with Mn acetate showed higher catalytic activity than MCM-48 impregnated with Mn nitrate. This result was attributed to the better dispersion within nanoporous MCM-48 and higher oxygen mobility of Mn oxides produced by Mn acetate. The catalytic activity was also shown to depend closely on the ozone concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Energy and Environmental System Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul 130-743, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong-Hwa", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurng", "ForeName": "Jongsoo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Gwi-Nam", "Initials": "GN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sung Hoon", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Jong-Ki", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sang Chai", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ji Man", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Young-Kwon", "Initials": "YK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22966685", "10.1166/jnn.2012.6411"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
