The roots were randomly distributed into 5 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a020). NaOCl of 2.5%\u00a0+\u00a0EDTA of 17% in group 1, CHX of 2% in group 2, toluidine blue\u00a0+\u00a0diode laser as the photodynamic therapy (PDT) in group 3 and ozone in group 4 were applied to the post spaces. Group 5 was washed with distilled water as control group. Each group was divided into two subgroups according to the adhesive types and the posts were bonded by using RelyX and LinkForce. The bond strength was calculated using the push-out test method. Resin tag formations were photographed with SEM. The push-out bond strength was analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey tests (p\u00a0=\u00a0.05).", "The PDT group, which showed the highest PBS among the groups bonded with LinkForce at all levels, was significantly higher than Ozone and DW groups (p<.05). NaOCl and ozone treatments provided the highest PBS among the groups bonded with RelyX for all levels and this difference was significant according to the DW group (p < .05).", "Post space treatments improved the bond strength of the fiber post \u200b\u200bin both types of resin cement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
