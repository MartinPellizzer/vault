To assess the exposure of forest areas and selected tree species to ozone, it is necessary to calculate the ozone exposure distribution. The present article describes the application of an ozone interpolation model to the calculation of the ozone exposure distribution in combination with forest inventory data.The exposure of forest regions to ozone was assessed by means of an AOT40 map (accumulated ozone exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb). The calculation was performed by hourly running of the model during the summer term and accumulation of the patterns that exceeded 40 ppb.The exposure of the primary Austrian tree species to ozone can be assessed due to the spatial relation of ozone exposure and tree species patterns. This spatial relation also allows the verification of assumptions concerning ozone-related tree damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Planning Department, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf, A-2444, Seibersdorf, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loibl", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smidt", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tree Physiol. 1987 Mar;3(1):63-91", "ArticleIdList": ["14975835"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1990;68(3-4):453-78", "ArticleIdList": ["15092190"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1990;64(3-4):385-95", "ArticleIdList": ["15092294"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24233419", "10.1007/BF02986962"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
