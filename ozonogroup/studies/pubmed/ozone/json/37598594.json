Within the EXPANSE project, we evaluated the association between long-term exposure to multiple environmental indices and stroke incidence across Europe.", "Participants from three traditional adult cohorts (Germany, Netherlands and Sweden) and four administrative cohorts (Catalonia [region Spain], Rome [city-wide], Greece and Sweden [nationwide]) were followed until incident stroke, death, migration, loss of follow-up or study end. We estimated exposures at residential addresses from different exposure domains: air pollution (nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), particulate matter\u00a0<\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), black carbon (BC), ozone), built environment (green/blue spaces, impervious surfaces) and meteorology (seasonal mean and standard deviation of temperatures). Associations between environmental exposures and stroke were estimated in single and multiple-exposure Cox proportional hazard models, and Principal Component (PC) Analyses derived prototypes for specific exposures domains. We carried out random effects meta-analyses by cohort type.", "In over 15 million participants, increased levels of NO<sub>2</sub> and BC were associated with increased higher stroke incidence in both cohort types. Increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was associated with a lower stroke incidence in both cohort types, whereas an increase in impervious surface was associated with an increase in stroke incidence. The first PC of the air pollution domain (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and BC) was associated with an increase in stroke incidence. For the built environment, higher levels of NDVI and lower levels of impervious surfaces were associated with a protective effect [%change in HR per 1 unit\u00a0=\u00a0-2.0 (95\u00a0%CI, -5.9;2.0) and -1.1(95\u00a0%CI, -2.0; -0.3) for traditional adult and administrative cohorts, respectively]. No clear patterns were observed for distance to blue spaces or temperature parameters.", "We observed increased HRs for stroke with exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and BC, lower levels of greenness and higher impervious surface in single and combined exposure models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
