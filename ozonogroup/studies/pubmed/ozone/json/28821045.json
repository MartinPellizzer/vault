Never dried softwood pulp with minimum mercerization was enzymatically treated leading to a homogeneous pulp slurry with a higher reactivity. The slurry was oxidized by ozone gas in the presence of syringic acid, a lignin degradation model compound, as an oxidation enhancer at room temperature and pH 11. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed that stable CNF bundles with 3-10nm widths and lengths >100nm were obtained after ultrasonication of the oxidized product in water. Extensive characterization of the new CNF films revealed the nanofibers had carboxylate content similar to conventional carboxylated cellulose prepared by TEMPO-mediated oxidation. Based on NMR spectra, chemical conversion of the syringic acid during oxidation is proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
