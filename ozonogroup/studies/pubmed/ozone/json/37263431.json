This system relies on the homogeneous radial distribution of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the reaction zone by \"titration\" through a microfiltration borosilicate tubular membrane, while the UWW swirls around the membrane and drags the O<sub>3</sub> microbubbles generated in the membrane shell-side. The membrane is coated with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>-P25) and radiation can be externally supplied via four UV lamps. The ozonation tests were carried out with secondary-treated UWW collected in different seasons (winter and summer) and spiked with a mix of 19 CECs (10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> each). For an O<sub>3</sub> dose of 18\u00a0g\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, the best performance was obtained by increasing the O<sub>3</sub> concentration (maximum [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>G,inlet</sub> of 200\u00a0g\u00a0Nm<sup>-3</sup>) and decreasing the gas flow rate (minimum Q<sub>G</sub> of 0.15 Ndm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>), providing the highest ozone transfer yield (88\u00a0%) and, thus higher specific ozone dose (g O<sub>3</sub> per g dissolved organic carbon). Under these conditions, removals >80\u00a0% or concentrations below the limit of quantification were obtained for up to 13 of the 19 CECs and reductions up to 5 log units for total heterotrophs and below the limit of detection for enterobacteria and enterococci. Tests including a UVC dose of 0.10\u00a0kJ\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> enhanced disinfection ability but had no impact on CECs oxidation. After ozonation, the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria was reduced but not eliminated, and microbial regrowth after 3-day storage was observed. No toxic effect was detected on zebrafish embryos using a dilution factor of 4 for the ozonized UWW and when granular activated carbon adsorption was subsequently applied the dilution factor decreased to 2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
