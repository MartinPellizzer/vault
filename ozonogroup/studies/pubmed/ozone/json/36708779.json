Its high toxicity and low biodegradability leads to long hydraulic retention time of biological process and high cost of advanced oxidation process. In this study, the simultaneous combination of ozonation and biodegradation (SCOB) was proposed to treat coking wastewater. Through this process, ozonation breaks the refractory organics, and the biodegradable intermediates are rapidly mineralized by microorganisms protected by porous carriers. Thus, the performances of SCOB, individual biodegradation and ozonation systems were compared. The long-term stability of the SCOB system was evaluated, the contributions of ozonation and biodegradation were analyzed, and their synergistic mechanisms were elaborated. Results showed that biological activity was inhibited in the biodegradation system, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was only 27.6% for the ozonation system. COD and total phenol removal of SCOB system reached 48.5% and 79.3%, respectively, and its kinetic degradation constant of COD was 55.6% higher than that of the ozonation system. Ozonation contributed to the oxidation of organics with unsaturated functional groups as well as soluble microbial products (SMPs), causing the effluent toxicity and chroma to decrease by 82.7% and 270 times, respectively. The higher abundances of microorganisms and functions were enriched in the core of carrier, which became dominant region for biodegradation. Consequently, COD removal of the SCOB system stabilized at >80% for real coking wastewater treatment, confirming its promising potential for the treatment of highly polluted industrial wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
