However, 100% DMP removal was rapidly reached when ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added with a Cu(II)/EDTA molar ratio of 3:1. Subsequent studies indicated that Cu(II)-DMP is sequestrated by EDTA, then DMP was degraded and Cu(II) was removed by precipitation. The freshly formed Cu-EDTA<sup>2-</sup> and organic nitrogen intermediates further decomposed O<sub>3</sub> into OH, which induced to the rapid degradation of DMP. The k<sub>obs</sub> of Cu-EDTA/O<sub>3</sub> were 9-10 times greater than the k<sub>obs</sub> of DMP removed by ozonation alone within 10\u2009min. The reaction mechanism involved a OH generation was proposed. The OH and O<sub>2</sub>- are generated from the rapid reaction between ozone and EDTA. Acting as a more strongly negative species, the specific Cu(II) in Cu-EDTA complexes is more inclined to react with O<sub>2</sub>- to give Cu(I), accelerating the forward reaction to produce more OH. The synergistic removal of DMP and Cu(II) can be achieved after reaction. Therefore, this study provides an effective method to dispose metal ion and organic pollutant wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
