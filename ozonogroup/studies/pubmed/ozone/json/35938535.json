Testing consisted of measuring ozone concentration during static tests where the ventilation of the test vehicle was turned on and off depending on the test. This testing was repeated for three different portable ionizers and two vehicles with built-in ionizers. Ionizer A produced ozone at a rate of \u223c0.04 ppb s<sup>-1</sup> (\u223c0.68 mg h<sup>-1</sup>), which increased the in-cabin O<sub>3</sub> concentrations of a Mitsubishi Mirage to \u223c10 ppb with the fan off and \u223c6 ppb in the recirculation mode. In the fresh air mode, in-cabin O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were dominated by outdoor-to-indoor transport. Ionizer B and C produced O<sub>3</sub> at a rate of less than 0.008 ppb s<sup>-1</sup> (<0.14 mg h<sup>-1</sup>); however, during retesting, ionizer C was shown to emit large amounts of ozone for short amounts of time while being tested up close. The same testing was completed on vehicles with built-in ionizers; these produced <0.01 ppb s<sup>-1</sup> (<0.32 mg h<sup>-1</sup> in the Buick Enclave and <0.25 mg h<sup>-1</sup> in the Hyundai Genesis), and in-cabin O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were again dominated by outdoor-to-indoor transport with fresh air ventilation. While ionizers are currently regulated, the negative impact they have on in cabin air quality is important to continue monitoring."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA. heejung@engr.ucr.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CE-CERT, University of California, Riverside, USA."}], "LastName": "Mendez-Jimenez", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2923-4073"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "LastName": "Lakey", "ForeName": "Pascale S J", "Initials": "PSJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA. heejung@engr.ucr.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CE-CERT, University of California, Riverside, USA."}], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Grace", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2532-5373"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}], "LastName": "Shiraiwa", "ForeName": "Manabu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0366-7284"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA. heejung@engr.ucr.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CE-CERT, University of California, Riverside, USA."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Heejung", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35938535", "10.1039/d2em00129b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
