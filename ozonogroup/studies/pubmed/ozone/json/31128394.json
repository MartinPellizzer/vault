This study comprehensively characterized the presence, elimination, and transformation of micropollutants in the WWTP using the suspect screening approaches by employing the gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Overall, 5724 features were identified in influent, while only 3418 features existed in effluents. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to group features based on intensity profiles to investigate the behavior and fate of detected features. Four representative trends were defined with the corresponding features. Among 117 compounds identified during the treatment process, there were 99 compounds in influent, 10 biological transformation products (TPs), 3 ozone TPs, and 5 ultraviolet TPs. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies for the detected compounds were determined. The study findings highlight the importance of the removal of emerging pollutants and TPs such as fipronil, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
