However, implementation of this approach requires the development of appropriate models which need to be rigorously tested against actual data collected under field conditions. This paper describes such an assessment of the stomatal component of the model described by Emberson et al. (2000. Modelling stomatal ozone flux across Europe. Environmental Pollution 110). Model predictions are compared with field measurements of both stomatal conductance (g(s)) and calculated ozone flux for shoots of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) growing in the Tyrol Mountains in Austria. The model has been developed to calculate g(s) as a function of leaf phenology and four environmental variables: photosynthetic flux density (PFD), temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture deficit (SMD). The model was run using climate data measured on site, although the SMD component was omitted since the necessary data were not available. The model parameterisation for Norway spruce had previously been collected from the scientific literature and therefore established independently from the measurement study. Overall, strong associations were found between model predictions and measured values of stomatal conductance to ozone (GO(3)) and calculated stomatal ozone flux (FO(3)). Average diurnal profiles of GO(3) and FO(3) showed good agreement between the field data and modelled values except during the morning period of 1990. The diurnal pattern of ozone flux was determined primarily by PFD and VPD, as there was little diurnal variation in ozone concentration. In general, the model predicted instances of high ozone flux satisfactorily, indicating its potential applicability in identifying areas of high ozone risk for this species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stockholm Environment Institute at York, University of York, UK. l.emberson@york.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emberson", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wieser", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashmore", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092872", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00042-7", "S0269-7491(00)00042-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
