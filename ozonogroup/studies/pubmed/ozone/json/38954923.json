Direct and indirect climate impacts were determined for methane and 79 trace species. The impacts were quantified using global warming potential, GWP (direct and indirect); atmospheric degradation (direct); tropospheric ozone forming potential (indirect); secondary aerosol forming potential (indirect) and stratospheric ozone depleting potential (indirect). Effects of cover characteristics, landfill operational conditions, and season on emissions were assessed. Analysis was conducted at five operating municipal solid waste landfills in California, which collectively contained 13% of the waste in place in the state. Climate impacts were determined to be primarily due to direct emissions (99.5 to 115%) with indirect emissions contributing -15 to 0.5%. Methane emissions were 35 to 99% of the total emissions and the remainder mainly greenhouse gases (hydro)chlorofluorocarbons (up to 42% of total emissions) and nitrous oxide. Cover types affected emissions, where the highest emissions were generally from intermediate covers with the largest relative landfill surface areas. Landfill-specific direct emissions varied between 683 and 103,411 and between 381 and 37,925\u00a0Mg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq./yr for 20- and 100-yr time horizons, respectively. Total emissions (direct\u00a0+\u00a0indirect) were 680 to 103,600 (20-yr) and were 374 to 38,108 (100-yr) Mg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq./yr. Analysis time horizon significantly affected emissions. The 20-yr direct and total emissions were consistently higher than the 100-yr emissions by up to 2.5 times. Detailed analysis of time-dependent climate effects can inform strategies to mitigate climate change impacts of landfill gas emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
