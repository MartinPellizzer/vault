Moderate wind speeds, strong solar radiation and high temperature were observed in all cities, indicating favorable meteorological conditions for local O<sub>3</sub> formation. However, the unusually frequent precipitation caused by typhoons reaching the eastern coastline resulted in the least severe air pollution in Shanghai. The highest O<sub>3</sub> level was found in Beijing, followed by Lanzhou and Wuhan, while relatively lower O<sub>3</sub> value was recorded in Chengdu and Shanghai. Photochemical box model simulations revealed that net O<sub>3</sub> production rate in Lanzhou was the largest, followed by Beijing, Wuhan and Chengdu, while it was the lowest in Shanghai. Besides, the O<sub>3</sub> formation was mainly controlled by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in most cities, but co-limited by VOCs and nitrogen oxides in Lanzhou. Moreover, the dominant VOC groups contributing to O<sub>3</sub> formation were oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) in Beijing and Wuhan, alkenes in Lanzhou, and aromatics and OVOCs in Shanghai and Chengdu. Source apportionment analysis identified six sources of O<sub>3</sub> precursors in these cities, including liquefied petroleum gas usage, diesel exhaust, gasoline exhaust, industrial emissions, solvent usage, and biogenic emissions. Gasoline exhaust dominated the O<sub>3</sub> formation in Beijing, and LPG usage and industrial emissions made comparable contributions in Lanzhou, while LPG usage and solvent usage played a leading role in Wuhan and Chengdu, respectively. The findings are helpful to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
