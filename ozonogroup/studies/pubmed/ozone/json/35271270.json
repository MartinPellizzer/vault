However, knowledge gaps remain in the long-term and nationwide responses to air pollutants to urbanization. The evolution of tropospheric ozone associated with urban land expansion across China was assessed from 1980 to 2017 using a coupled WRF-Chem model based on a recently updated land use change (LUC) data set. The results revealed that urban-land expansion drove growing ozone trends for this period and contributed about 3-9% to its summer maximum concentrations during the 2010s in major urban agglomerations across China. The association between a long-term change in summer O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and LUC after excluding the effect of precursor emissions and meteorological conditions and causes of interannual (short-term) variations in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations induced by urban-land expansion were also explored by examining the relationships between ozone fluctuations and meteorological variables."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, P.R.
