We investigate impacts of air-cleaning on indoor TRAP levels and indoor chemistry in a renovated school adjacent an interstate highway. We monitor air pollutants pre- and post-renovation and quantify efficiency of particle (MERV8 and 16 filters) and gas (functionalized activated carbon) air-cleaning. Time-resolved measurements show air-cleaning systems are effective, with in situ particle removal efficiency >94% across 10 nm to 10 \u03bcm. Activated carbon removed BTEX and NO<sub>2</sub> with variability in removal efficiency. Over eight months of monitoring, NO<sub>2</sub> removal efficiency was 96% initially and decreased to 61%; and BTEX removal efficiency was >80% or increased to >80%. Air-cleaning reduced indoor TRAP to below or near urban background. Air-cleaning systems suppressed indoor chemistry by reducing indoor levels of oxidants (NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>) and reactive organics of indoor origin. When the air cleaning system was inactive, our data show that indoor SOA formation within the school was elevated. Loss rates of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> through the air-cleaning system were \u223c1.5-2.4 h<sup>-1</sup> and \u223c2.3 h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Air-cleaning was 83% and 69% efficient, respectively, in removing monoterpenes and isoprene. By suppressing precursors, scaling calculations show air-cleaning prevented \u223c3.4 mg/h of indoor SOA formation due to indoor ozone-monoterpene chemistry. For comparison, we estimate that filtration removed \u223c130 mg/h of PM<sub>0.01-0.3</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8167-3586"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Portland State University, 1930 SW 4th Avenue, Suite 400, Portland, Oregon 97201, United States."}], "LastName": "Laguerre", "ForeName": "Aur\u00e9lie", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Management, Portland State University, P.O.
