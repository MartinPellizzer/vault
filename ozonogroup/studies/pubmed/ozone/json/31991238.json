We aimed to examine the relation between day-to-day changes in ozone concentrations and hospital admissions for pneumonia in China. We conducted a national time-series study in 184 major Chinese cities from 2014 to 2017. City-specific relation between ozone concentrations and pneumonia admissions was evaluated using an over-dispersed generalized additive model. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to pool the city-specific estimates. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the relations. We also investigated potential effect modifiers. Overall, we observed increased admissions for pneumonia associated with ozone exposure. The national-average estimates per 10-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in ozone were 0.14% (95% CI: 0.03%-0.25%) at lag 0\u00a0day in the whole year, 0.30% (95% CI: 0.17%-0.43%) at lag 0\u00a0day in the warm season, and 0.20% (95% CI: 0.05%-0.34%) at lag 1\u00a0day in the cool season. Two-pollutant models indicated that the ozone effects were not confounded by PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> or CO. The association between ozone and pneumonia was stronger in the elderly. Ozone levels and gross domestic product per capita reduced the effects of ozone, and smoking enhanced the effects of ozone. In conclusion, we estimated an increase in daily pneumonia admissions associated with ozone exposure in China. As the first national study in China to report acute effect of ozone on pneumonia hospitalizations, our findings are incredibly meaningful in terms of both ozone pollution related policy development and pneumonia prevention."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
