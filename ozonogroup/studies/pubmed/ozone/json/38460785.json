Obtaining viable C. cayetanensis oocysts to evaluate inactivation methods is challenging because we lack the means to propagate them in vitro, because of delays in case reporting, and because health departments typically add inactivating fixatives to clinical specimens. Research in various surrogate organisms has sought to bolster understanding of the biology of C. cayetanensis. Among these surrogates is the poultry parasite Eimeria acervulina, a closely related and easily cultured parasite of economic significance. We used this surrogate to evaluate the consequences of ozone treatment, using the sporulation state as an indicator of infectious potential. Treating with ozonated water acidified with citric acid reduced sporulation ability in a dose-dependent manner; treatment with up to 4.93\u00a0mg/L initial concentration of ozone resulted in a 93% inactivation of sporulation by 7\u00a0days posttreatment. This developmental arrest was accompanied by transcriptional changes in genes involved in regulating the response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a time course that is consistent with the production of oxygen free radicals. This study shows that ozone is highly effective in preventing sporulation of E. acervulina, a model coccidian used as a surrogate for Cyclospora. Furthermore, ozone exposure induced molecular responses to general oxidative stress, documented with several well-characterized antioxidant enzymes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
