However, the contribution of the changes for each emission source to the elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentration, as well as the direct and indirect effect of meteorological condition variation on increased O<sub>3</sub> level have not been comprehensively analyzed. This study applied the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model coupled with the integrated source apportionment method (ISAM) to quantify changes in daily maximum 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> concentration (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) under different air pollutants emissions and meteorological conditions during summertime 2012-2017. The results showed that incoordinate NOx/VOC emission control sustainably increased MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> by 2.2-36.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the NCP, of which emission changes from industrial and transportation sectors were the predominant contributors (-0.6-19.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for industrial sector and 1.2-18.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for transportation, respectively). In contrast, MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> decreased by 2.5-9.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for the power plants. The effect of changes in meteorological condition on MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> exhibited significantly spatial and temporal variation and unfavorable meteorological fields were shown in 2014, 2016, and 2017, which enhanced MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> by -2.5-23.1, -5.3-20.7, and -7.2-25.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. In addition, the changed meteorological factors indirectly affected the biogenic emission thus prompting the increases of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> by -3.9-4.9\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in the NCP during 2012-2017. The sensitive simulations suggested that more aggressive control measures about VOC reduction in industrial and transportation sectors should be implemented to further mitigate the O<sub>3</sub> pollution under unfavorable meteorological condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
