GBP was detected in all samples with average concentrations of 1285\u00a0ng/L (n\u00a0=\u00a024) for wastewater effluent, 304\u00a0ng/L for river water (n\u00a0=\u00a022), and 180\u00a0ng/L for drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) influent (n\u00a0=\u00a04). The monitoring sites were located in the Nakdong River watershed, Korea. GBP was rapidly (within 20\u00a0min) transformed into 1-cyanocyclohexylacetic acid (GBP-nitrile) under typical chlorination conditions (1.4 mgCl<sub>2</sub>/L). When there was a molar excess of chlorine to GBP, the primary amine of GBP was double-chlorinated to form N-Cl<sub>2</sub> GBP with a second-order rate constant of >10<sup>3</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. Decomposition of N-Cl<sub>2</sub> GBP had a first-order rate constant of (0.5-1.0)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and produced GBP-nitrile with a yield of 87%-100%. We propose that N-Cl<sub>2</sub> GBP is transformed into N-Cl GBP imine and then to GBP-nitrile via two consecutive dehydrochlorinations with the former as the rate-limiting step. N-Cl<sub>2</sub> GBP had a much higher decomposition rate than N-Cl<sub>2</sub> produced from other simple aliphatic amines, which could be related to the structural features of GBP such as its carboxyl group and quaternary \u03b2-carbon. The wastewater effluent samples did not contain GBP-nitrile even in the chlorinated effluent because of the relatively low chlorine dose or high ammonia level. In a full-scale DWTP employing a pre-chlorination unit, GBP present in the influent river water was fully transformed into GBP-nitrile. The formed GBP-nitrile was degraded in subsequent ozonation (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH oxidation) and biological activated carbon filtration (biodegradation) processes. The toxicity of GBP-nitrile is thought to be low but further studies are warranted to assess the toxicological relevance of nitrile formation during water chlorination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
