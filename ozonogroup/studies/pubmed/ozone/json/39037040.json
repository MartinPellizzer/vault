Therefore, better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these disease states requires detailed structural characterization of the individual lipids within the complex cellular milieu. Recently, changes in the unsaturation profile of membrane lipids have been observed in cancer cells and tissues, but assigning the position(s) of carbon-carbon double bonds in fatty acyl chains carried by membrane phospholipids, including the resolution of lipid regioisomers, has proven analytically challenging. Conventional tandem mass spectrometry approaches based on collision-induced dissociation of ionized glycerophospholipids do not yield spectra that are indicative of the location(s) of carbon-carbon double bonds. Ozone-induced dissociation (OzID) and ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) have emerged as alternative ion activation modalities wherein diagnostic product ions can enable <i>de novo</i> assignment of position(s) of unsaturation based on predictable fragmentation behaviors. Here, for the first time, OzID and UVPD (193 nm) mass spectra are acquired on the same mass spectrometer to evaluate the relative performance of the two modalities for lipid identification and to interrogate the respective fragmentation pathways under comparable conditions. Based on investigations of lipid standards, fragmentation rules for each technique are expanded to increase confidence in structural assignments and exclude potential false positives. Parallel application of both methods to unsaturated phosphatidylcholines extracted from isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines provides high confidence in the assignment of multiple double bond isomers in these samples and cross-validates relative changes in isomer abundance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8939-0249"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Physics, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Brydon", "ForeName": "Samuel C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0420-6116"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Physics, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Poad", "ForeName": "Berwyck L J", "Initials": "BLJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Mengxuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Rustam", "ForeName": "Yepy H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Horizons and School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "Reuben S E", "Initials": "RSE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Personalized Oncology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Mouradov", "ForeName": "Dmitri", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Personalized Oncology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sieber", "ForeName": "Oliver M", "Initials": "OM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Horizons and School of Medical, Indigenous and Health Sciences, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia."}], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "Todd W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9675-1444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia."}], "LastName": "Reid", "ForeName": "Gavin E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8560-756X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Physics, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Blanksby", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1711-2338"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Soc Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9010412", "ISSNLinking": "1044-0305"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39037040", "10.1021/jasms.4c00221"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
