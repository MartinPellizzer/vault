This study aimed to introduce a UV-VIS spectrum representative index by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and apply UV-Vis spectrophotometric techniques for real-time organic compound monitoring in the AOP process using anaerobic digestion tank effluent wastewater. The effect of advanced oxidation on the organic compounds of effluent using ozonation was examined. In this research, after treating secondary treated water with the UV-AOP process and anaerobic digestion effluent with ozone microbubble systems, changes in organic substances were expressed by the UV-Vis spectrum and compared with conventional water quality parameters. The anaerobic digestion process effluent was treated through ozone oxidation, had a high curve, and fell gently from 230 to 667 nm. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was applied to obtain representative values from the obtained spectrum. From among the coefficients obtained by analyzing the UV-Vis spectrum through DFT, an expected value was selected, and the correlation between COD<sub>Mn</sub> and a3 was the highest (correlation function = 0.694, RSQ = 0.482). Therefore, a linear regression analysis was performed to determine which water quality factor it was related to."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
