Phenanthrene, pyrene, and their ozonized products were dissolved in DMSO (50 mg/ml). Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was increased significantly 24 hr after ip administration of DMSO when compared with physiological saline. Phenanthrene produced a significant elevation of serum AST and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels related to physiological saline and DMSO-injected rats 24 hr after injection. However, GGTP levels for groups treated with DMSO or phenanthrene were not significantly increased when compared with saline groups 72 hr after injection. Ozonized products of phenanthrene produced a significant elevation of serum AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GGTP, and bilirubin levels when compared with groups treated with physiological saline, DMSO, and phenanthrene 24 or 72 hr after injections. The ozonized products of phenanthrene also produced significant elevation of serum creatinine levels compared with physiological saline, DMSO, and phenanthrene groups at 24 hr after treatment and of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels at 24 and 72 hr. Although pyrene caused a small but significant increase in the serum AST and bilirubin levels 24 hr after treatment, no significant change in the serum AST, ALT, GGTP, BUN, and creatine levels were observed with the ozonized products of pyrene at 24 or 72 hr. This study demonstrates significant alterations in serum chemistry induced by reaction products of ozone with phenanthrene. No such effect was observed when the products of pyrene ozonation were administered. Although the ozonation products of pyrene were not toxic under the conditions of this study, phenanthrene products were more hepatotoxic than was phenanthrene itself. Nephrotoxicity was also an apparent effect of ozonized phenanthrene. Since ozone-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) reactions may occur in the atmosphere, these reactions might produce compounds that are more toxic than either ozone or the PAH alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruhr", "ForeName": "L P", "Initials": "LP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flory", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giamalva", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Church", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pryor", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-16029", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "448J8E5BST", "NameOfSubstance": "phenanthrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E0T7WFW93", "NameOfSubstance": "pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.2.2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RFM9X3LJ49", "NameOfSubstance": "Bilirubin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YOW8V9698H", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Bilirubin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2860738", "10.1016/0041-008x(85)90343-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
