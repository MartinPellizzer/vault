To explore the capability of advanced oxidation processes for the rapid removal of biocides, we examined the total organic carbon (TOC) reduction of 4-chloro-3,5-dimethylphenol (PCMX) with a combination of UV/O(3). Moreover, the related important parameters, including the mass transfer coefficient and light utilization efficiency, in PCMX degradation were determined. The UV/O(3) experimental results showed a pronounced synergistic effect, leading to the nearly complete elimination of TOC within 75 min. Thus, the effect of operating variables was investigated as a function of pH, ozone dosage, bulk temperature and the initial concentration of PCMX. The efficiency of PCMX mineralization increased with an increase in ozone dose up to 3.1 gh(-1), and a decrease in the initial concentration from 250 to 100mg L(-1). The optimal pH value was 4.0, and the preferred bulk temperature was 20 degrees C on the basis of the influence of temperature on reaction rate and ozone solubility. The major aromatic intermediates identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry were 2,6-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diol, 2,6-dimethylbenzo-1,4-quinone, 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzo-1,4-quinone, and 2,6-dimethylbenzo-1,4-aldehyde. Quantitative determination of related carboxylic acid and inorganic anions was done by ion chromatography. On the basis of the identified reaction products, a possible degradation pathway for the UV/O(3) oxidation of PCMX in aqueous media is proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China. ss@zjut.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhiwu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhiqiao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianmeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chaolin", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0F32U78V2Q", "NameOfSubstance": "chloroxylenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19818989", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.09.026", "S0045-6535(09)01088-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
