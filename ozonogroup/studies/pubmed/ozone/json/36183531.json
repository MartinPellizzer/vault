Here we emphasize the great challenges in controlling O<sub>3</sub> pollution by analyzing the recent experience of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southern China in reducing the autumn O<sub>3</sub> peaks. Despite significant reductions in the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> precursors, i.e., nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the PRD was largely worse in autumn 2019 than in autumn 2018. We found that the supra-regional and regional background concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> increased significantly in the PRD in autumn 2019 due to increased concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> in the vast surrounding areas. We also observed slight increases in the concentrations of PRD-regionally and Guangzhou-locally produced O<sub>3</sub>. A chemical box-model analysis confirmed a slight increase in the in-situ production of O<sub>3</sub> and revealed that increased biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) and decreased NO<sub>x</sub> levels negated the effect of significant decrease in the anthropogenic VOCs. Taken together, these aspects exacerbated O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the PRD region in autumn 2019 relative to autumn 2018. The findings from this study highlight the strong interactions of O<sub>3</sub> pollution over multiple regions and the need for collaborative inter-regional efforts to control O<sub>3</sub> pollution. The experience of PRD also underlines the key role of BVOCs and the importance of science-based strategies to decrease VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
