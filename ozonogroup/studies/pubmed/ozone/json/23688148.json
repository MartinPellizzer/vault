To accurately assess the environmental impact of CCS, a sound understanding of the fate of MEA in the atmosphere is necessary. Relative and absolute rate kinetic experiments were conducted in a smog chamber using online proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) to follow the decay of MEA. The room temperature (295 \u00b1 3K) kinetics of oxidation with hydroxyl radicals from light and dark sources yield an average value of (7.02 \u00b1 0.46) \u00d7 10(-11) cm(3) molec(-1) s(-1), in good agreement with previously published data. For the first time, the rate coefficient for MEA with ozone was measured: (1.09 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10(-18) cm(3) molec(-1) s(-1). An investigation into the oxidation products was also conducted using online chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CI-TOFMS) where formamide, isocyanic acid as well as higher order products including cyclic amines were detected. Significant particle numbers and mass loadings were observed during the MEA oxidation experiments and accounted for over 15% of the fate of MEA-derived nitrogen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St George Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3H6."}], "LastName": "Borduas", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Jennifer G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5KV86114PT", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanolamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23688148", "10.1021/es401282j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
