The analysis is applied toward the space flight mission of the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE), which will be flown on the Applications Explorer Mission B (AEM-B) spacecraft. The instrument has four radiometric channels located at selected intervals in the 0.38-1.0-,microm wavelength range. The expected retrieval accuracies are deterrrined from inverting simulated data with various experimental errors included. The results from this analysis assuming a horizontally homogeneous atmosphere indicate that aerosol, ozone, and neutral density vertical profiles can be retrieved to an accuracy better than 10% with about 1-km vertical resolution over most of the stratosphere. The results also show that nitrogen dioxide can be inverted to an accuracy of about 25% in the 25-38-km altitude ange. In addition, the effects of horizontally inhomogeneous distributions of aerosol and ozone on the retrieval accuracies are analyzed based on a simple inhomogeneous model of the atmosphere and found that there is only a small perturbation on the inversion accuracies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCormick", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20212859", "10.1364/AO.18.001404", "22984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
