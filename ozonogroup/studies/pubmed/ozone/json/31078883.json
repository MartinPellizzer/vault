It was found that the HOC process exhibited higher organic matter removal performance compared with coagulation and the pre-ozonation-coagulation process. It was found that the high ibuprofen (IBP) removal efficiency in the HOC process was mainly attributed to OH oxidation promoted by in situ formed hydrolysed aluminium species from AlCl<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O and preformed Al<sub>13</sub>. Furthermore, the surface hydroxyl groups were determined to be the active reaction sites for the HOC process. Due to the higher proportion of surface hydroxyl groups for Al<sub>13</sub>, the HOC process with preformed Al<sub>13</sub> as coagulants (Al<sub>13</sub>-HOC) exhibited a higher removal performance than that with AlCl<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O as the coagulant (AlCl<sub>3</sub>-HOC). It was revealed that most of the generated O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> in the Al<sub>13</sub>-HOC was adsorbed on the surface of Al<sub>13</sub> at different pH values, while a considerably lower proportion of adsorbed O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> was observed on the surface of in situ formed Al species from AlCl<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O. Nevertheless, low proportions of adsorbed OH were found on the surfaces of both preformed Al<sub>13</sub> and in situ formed Al species, indicating that the OH oxidation for the removal of organic pollutants occurred primarily in the aqueous phase."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
