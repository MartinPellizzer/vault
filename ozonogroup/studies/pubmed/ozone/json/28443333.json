A screening process ranked the effect of perturbations in 223 inputs, isolating the 30 most influential from emissions, boundary conditions (BCs), and reaction rates. Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulations of a July 2006 ozone pollution episode in the UK were made with input values for these variables plus ozone dry deposition velocity chosen according to a 576 point Latin hypercube design. Emulators trained on the output of these runs were used in variance-based SA of the model output to input uncertainties. Performing these analyses for every hour of a 21 day period spanning the episode and several days on either side allowed the results to be presented as a time series of sensitivity coefficients, showing how the influence of different input uncertainties changed during the episode. This is one of the most complex models to which these methods have been applied, and here, they reveal detailed spatiotemporal patterns of model sensitivities, with NO and isoprene emissions, NO<sub>2</sub> photolysis, ozone BCs, and deposition velocity being among the most influential input uncertainties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King's College London , Waterloo, London, SE1 8WA, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7455-4087"], "LastName": "Beddows", "ForeName": "Andrew V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King's College London , Waterloo, London, SE1 8WA, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kitwiroon", "ForeName": "Nutthida", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King's College London , Waterloo, London, SE1 8WA, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "Martin L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King's College London , Waterloo, London, SE1 8WA, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beevers", "ForeName": "Sean D", "Initials": "SD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28443333", "10.1021/acs.est.6b05873"]}}]}
