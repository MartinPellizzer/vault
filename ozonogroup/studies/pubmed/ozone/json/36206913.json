This study assesses personal exposure to particulate matter with different aerodynamic diameters and multiple gaseous pollutants from 123 rural residents in Yuncheng, the Fenwei Plain. The subjects are divided into groups based on the unique energy source applied, including biomass, coal, and electricity/no heating activities. The health effects of the exposures are expressed with four urinary biomarkers. The personal exposure levels to three different aerodynamic particle sizes (i.e., PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>1</sub>) of the electricity/no heating group are 5.1 % -12 % lower than those of the coal group. In addition, the exposure levels are 25 %-40 % lower for carbon monoxide (CO) and 10.8 %-20.3 % lower for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the electricity/no heating group than the other two fuel groups. C-reactive protein (CRP) in the urine of the participants in biomass and coal groups is significantly higher than that in the electricity/no heating group, consistent with the observations on other biomarkers. Increases in 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are observed for the exposures to higher concentrations of air pollutants. For instance, PMs and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) show significant impacts on positive correlations with 8-OHdG and IL-8, while O<sub>3</sub> positively correlates with CRP. PM<sub>1</sub> exhibits higher effects on the biomarkers than the gaseous pollutants, especially on VEGF and IL-8. The study indicates that excessive use of traditional domestic solid fuels could pose severe health effects on rural residents. The promotion of using clean energy is urgently needed in the rural areas of northern China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
