In this work, the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program tool is applied to estimate the health and economic impacts of projected changes in O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the U.S. in future (2046-2055) decade relative to current (2001-2010) decade under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. Future annual-mean O<sub>3</sub> reductions under RCP 4.5 prevent ~1,800 all-cause mortality, 761 respiratory hospital admissions (HA), and ~1.2 million school loss days annually, and result in economic benefits of ~16 billion, 29 million, and 132 million U.S. dollars (USD), respectively. By contrast, the projected future annual-mean O<sub>3</sub> increases under RCP8.5 cause ~2,400 mortality, 941 respiratory HA, and ~1.6 million school loss days annually and result in economic disbenefits of ~21 billion, 36 million, and 175 million USD, respectively. Health benefits of reduced O<sub>3</sub> double under RCP4.5 and health dis-benefits of increased O<sub>3</sub> increase by 1.5 times under RCP8.5 in future with 2050 population and baseline incidence rate. Because of the reduction in projected future PM<sub>2.5</sub> over CONUS under both scenarios, the annual avoided all-cause deaths, cardiovascular HA, respiratory HA, and work loss days are ~63,000 and ~83,000, ~5,300 and ~7,000, ~12,000 and ~15,000, and ~7.8 million and ~10 million, respectively, leading to economic benefits of ~560 and ~740 billion, ~240 and ~320 million, ~450 and ~590 million, and ~1,400 and ~1,900 million USD for RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Health benefits of reduced PM<sub>2.5</sub> for future almost double under both scenarios with the largest benefits in urban areas. RCP8.5 projects larger health and economic benefits due to a greater reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> but with a warmer atmosphere and higher O<sub>3</sub> pollution than RCP4.5. RCP4.5 leads to multiple-benefit goals including reduced O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, reduced mortality and morbidity, and saved costs. Greater reduction in future PM<sub>2.5</sub> under RCP4.5 should be considered to achieve larger multi-benefits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).
