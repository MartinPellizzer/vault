In this study, we propose a facile route to fabricate millimeter-scale, three-dimensional semiconducting SWCNT (s-SWCNT) aerogels and demonstrate deactivation of the co-existing metallic SWCNT (m-SWCNT) network via electrical breakdown process. In particular, the on-off ratio of the modulated semiconducting aerogel after the electrical breakdown process was 205, which is an increase of 18.9 times over that before the process. The modulated semiconducting SWCNT aerogels with a large specific surface area (\u223c1270\u2009m<sup>2</sup>\u2009g<sup>-1</sup>) demonstrated their applicability for highly sensitive ppb-level ozone detection. The modulated semiconducting networks led to a 1310 % increase in the magnitude of response to 30-ppb ozone gas injection compared with that of pristine SWCNT aerogels. Furthermore, the prepared aerogels could detect 3\u2009ppb of ozone within 40\u2009s and retain stable reversible ozone detection for 200 cyclic operations over 100\u2009h. Thus, the proposed semiconducting SWCNT aerogels are a promising candidate for highly sensitive environmental gas sensors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
