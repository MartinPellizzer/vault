Meanwhile, the impact of ozone on tree roots is greatly affected by soil condition. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the possible effects of ozone on tree roots and soil processes. In this study, The influences of surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) stress on the root biomass, morphology, nutrients, soil properties, and soil enzyme activity of Elaeocarpus sylvestris and Michelia chapensis seedlings were examined at four O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (charcoal-filtered air, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009O<sub>3</sub> air, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009O<sub>3</sub> air, and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009O<sub>3</sub> air). Elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were found to significantly increase the root C content, N content, C/P ratio, and N/P ratio, and significantly decrease the root biomass, number of root tips, and root C/N ratio of both species. The soil organic matter content, pH, total N content, and urease and catalase activities of both species tended to increase. The limitation in root growth and responses in the root structure of E. sylvestris induced by elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations led to increased bulk density and decreased soil porosity and void ratio. These profound effects of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on the roots and soil characteristics of these two species underscore the importance of research in O<sub>3</sub> science."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wan-Qi", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Eco-Engineering Polytechnic, Guangzhou, 510520, People's Republic of China. cartonlie@163.com."}], "LastName": "Lie", "ForeName": "Gan-Wen", "Initials": "GW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China. forxue@scau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong-Yue", "Initials": "HY"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "201004042", "Agency": "Special Research Project of Forestry Public Welfare Industry", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "4400-F19065", "Agency": "Ecological forest project of Guangdong province", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Elaeocarpaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32239255", "10.1007/s00128-020-02832-x", "10.1007/s00128-020-02832-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
