A cross-sectional study of 770 children swimming in three school pools was carried out over a 4 week period in November 1994 using a postal questionnaire. Physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters of water quality were monitored on a weekly basis. Responses were obtained for 385 swimmers. Skin rashes with an onset less than 24 h after swimming in the school pool were reported by 4-8% of swimmers. Compared with the bromine/ozone pool, the odds ratio (OR) of having a rash that started less than 24 h after pool use was 1.91 (CI 0.71-5.10) for the chlorine pool and 1.88 (CI 0.61-5.81) for the chlorine/ozone pool. Adjustment for possible confounders made no significant differences to these results. Eye redness, itch or irritation was reported by 23-33% of swimmers and 24% of non-swimmers, and wearing swimming goggles had a protective effect (OR 0.40; CI 0.24, 0.65). Disinfectant levels were more consistently maintained in the pools with automatically controlled systems. The bromine disinfection system was not associated with a greater risk of the development of skin rashes than other disinfection systems, but the numbers were small, and need to be interpreted with caution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Development Division, Department of Human Services, Victoria, 17/120 Spencer Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelsall", "ForeName": "H L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sim", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eye Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eye Protective Devices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming Pools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11260785", "10.1080/09603120020019629"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
