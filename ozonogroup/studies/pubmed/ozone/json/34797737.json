Polyunsaturated omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids (FAs) appear to attenuate the health effects of air pollution. <b>Objectives:</b> This panel study evaluated whether n-3 FA intake and blood levels of polyunsaturated omega 6 (n-6) FAs can modulate the associations between respiratory effects and short-term exposure to ambient air pollution in healthy adults. <b>Methods:</b> Sixty-two healthy adults were enrolled into either high or low n-3 FA groups on the basis of n-3 FA intake and erythrocyte n-3 FA concentrations. Low and high n-6 FA groups were dichotomized on the basis of blood n-6 FA levels. Participants underwent three to five testing sessions separated by at least 7 days. At each session, the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and plasma markers of inflammation (IL-6 [interleukin-6]) and oxidative stress (ox-LDL [oxidized low-density lipoprotein]) were measured. Associations between the ambient ozone and fine particulate matter (PM) (PM with an aerodynamic diameter \u2a7d2.5 \u03bcm [PM<sub>2.5</sub>]) levels and the lung function and blood markers were assessed by using mixed-effect models stratified by FA levels. <b>Results:</b> Average levels of ozone (40.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 ppb) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (10.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) were below national ambient air quality standards during the study period. FVC was positively associated with ozone at a lag of 0 days (lag0) in the high n-3 FA group, whereas the association was null in the low n-3 FA group (for an interquartile range increase in ozone of 1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5% to 3.2%] vs. 0.0% [95% CI: -1.4% to 1.5%]); however, the association shifted to being negative at lag4 (-1.9% [95% CI: -3.2 to -0.5] vs. 0.2% [95% CI: -1.2% to 1.5%]) and lag5 (-1.2% [95% CI: -2.4% to 0.0%] vs. 0.9% [95% CI: -0.4% to 2.3%]). A similar pattern was observed in the low n-6 FA group compared with the high n-6 FA group (lag0: 1.7% [95% CI: 0.3% to 3.0%] vs. 0.5% [95% CI: -0.9% to 2.0%] and lag4: -1.4% [95% CI: -2.8% to 0.0%] vs. -0.5% [95% CI: -1.8% to 0.9%]). The associations between FEV<sub>1</sub> and ozone and between FVC and PM<sub>2.5</sub> also followed a similar pattern. Elevated ozone levels were associated with an immediate decrease in ox-LDL in the high n-3 FA group at lag0 (-12.3% [95% CI: -24.8% to 0.1%]), whereas there was no change in the low n-3 FA group (-7.5% [95% CI: -21.4% to 6.5%]) and there was a delayed increase in IL-6 in the high n-3 FA group compared with the low n-3 FA group (lag4: 66.9% [95% CI: 27.9% to 106.0%] vs. 8.9% [95% CI: -31.8% to 49.6%], lag5: 58.2% [95% CI: 22.4% to 94.1%] vs. -7.4% [95% CI: -48.8% to 34.0%], and lag6: 45.8% [95% CI: 8.7% to 82.9%] vs. -8.5% [95% CI: -49.7% to 32.6%]). <b>Conclusions:</b> We observed lag-dependent associations between short-term ambient air pollutants and lung function that were differentially modulated by n-3 and n-6 FAs, suggesting that n-3 and n-6 FAs counteract the respiratory response to low levels of ambient air pollution in healthy adults.Clinical trial registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02921048)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Haiyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz M\u00fcnchen, Neuherberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Siqi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, Tennessee;
