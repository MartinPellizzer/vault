The electrical and particle collection performance was evaluated for submicrometer particles smaller than 0.01- 0.5 micrometer in diameter by varying the voltages applied to the pre-charger and collection plates as well as the polarity of the voltage. The collection efficiency was compared with that calculated by the theoretical models. The long-term performances of the ESP with and without water films were also compared in tests using Japanese Industrial Standards dust. The experimental results show that the carbon brush pre-charger of the two-stage wet ESP had approximately 10% particle capture, while producing ozone concentrations of less than 30 ppb. The produced amounts of ozone are significantly lower than the current limits set by international agencies. The ESP also achieved a high collection rate performance, averaging 90% for ultrafine particles, as based on the particle number concentration at an average velocity of 1 m/sec corresponding to a residence time of 0.17 sec. Higher particle collection efficiency for the ESP can be achieved by increasing the voltages applied to the pre-charger and the collection plates. The decreased collection efficiency that occurred during dust loading without water films was completely avoided by forming a thin water film on the collection plates at a water flow rate of 6.5 L/min/m(2)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment and Energy Systems Research Division, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, Daejeon, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hak-Joon", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Bangwoo", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yong-Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Kyu-Dong", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Won-Seek", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Seong-Yeon", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oda", "ForeName": "Tetsuji", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Precipitation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Static Electricity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22263421", "10.1080/10473289.2011.603994"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
