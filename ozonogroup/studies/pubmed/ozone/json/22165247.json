The results showed that the principal pollutant was PM10, and the average concentration was (99 +/- 88), (121 +/- 74), (141 +/- 92) and (180 +/- 107) microg/m3, respectively. The concentration of NO(x) was (66 +/- 48), (23 +/- 14), (47 +/- 35) and (52 +/- 32) microg/m3, respectively. Ozone, the photochemical pollutant, the daily maximum concentration hourly was (107 +/- 60), (128 +/- 55), (164 +/- 61) and (120 +/- 54) microg/m3, respectively. Owing to the emission of local sources, the atmospheric PM10 pollution of Shijiazhuang was the most serious in 4 cities, in order was Baoding, Zhuozhou and Beijing. However, the average concentration of O3 in Baoding was the highest for the dual influence of Beijing and Shijiazhuang. Two episodes of heavy regional atmospheric pollution in July 2009 were analyzed with the surface meteorological data and backward trajectory model. The results suggested that the air quality in Beijing and the surrounding areas was significant influenced by the three cities of Hebei province in summer-autumn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China. designwuying@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Dong-Sheng", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-Si", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22165247"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
