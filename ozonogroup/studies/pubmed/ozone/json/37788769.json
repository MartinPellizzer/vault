Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as common precursors of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, play a significant role in air pollution control. Chemical industrial parks (CIPs) are crucial emission sources of VOCs and have garnered significant attention. This study focused on 142 CIPs located in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) to investigate the characteristics of VOC emissions from CIPs and their impact on O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub> compound pollution, considering the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) model was employed for this analysis. The results show that VOC emissions from CIPs contributed significantly to regional O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), accounting for 17.1\u00a0% and 18.18\u00a0% of the anthropogenic sources, respectively. Regions exhibiting the highest contributions were located along the Hangzhou Bay. Compared with 2014, an elevation in the contribution of VOC emissions from CIPs to the annual average concentrations of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> and SOA in the YRD in 2017 by 0.069\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 0.007\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. During episodes of compound pollution, the concentration of atmospheric oxidant (HO<sub>x</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0NO<sub>3</sub>) was 28.65\u00a0% higher than during clean days, and significant positive correlations were observed between hydrogen oxygen radicals (HO<sub>x</sub>) and maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) as well as between HO<sub>x</sub> and SOA, exhibiting correlation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.48, respectively. Effective control measures for VOC emissions, particularly from the pharmaceutical and petrochemical industry parks located along Hangzhou Bay, are essential in curtailing the production rate of HO<sub>x</sub> and in regulating AOC levels in the YRD. Maintaining the daily average HO<sub>x</sub> concentration below 10\u00a0ppt would be a valuable strategy in achieving coordinated control of O<sub>3</sub> and SOA, thus aiding in the alleviation of O<sub>3</sub>-PM<sub>2.5</sub> compound pollution in the YRD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
