The kallikreinkinin system parameters were distinctly altered in the patients with peritonitis and the rate of the system activation correlated with the disease severity. Content of the alpha 1-inhibitor of proteinases (alpha 1-PI) was increased by the middle period of the treatment course and decreased as the inflammation lowered. alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2-MG) was altered less distinctly as compared with alpha 1-PI. Patterns of the antiproteinase potential in blood plasma (alpha 1-PI and alpha 2-MG) may be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in post-surgical treatment of patients with diffuse peritonitis; a decrease in the potential value proved to be a symptom of danger. Both mexidole and ozone exhibited positive clinical effect in treatment of the disease. Although these drugs had an opposing effect on the proteinases activity, their similar action on the antiproteinase potential appears to be responsible for the medicinal efficiency. Clinical effect of the drugs may be arranged as follows: mexidole, ozone administered intravenously and ozone used for intraabdominal washing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhebelenko", "ForeName": "G I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vasil'ev", "ForeName": "I T", "Initials": "IT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iarovaia", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muladze", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kantariia", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Sostoianie kallikrein-kininovo\u012d sistemy i uroven' antiproteinaznogo potentsiala pri posleoperatsionnom lechenii razlichnykh form peritonita."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vopr Med Khim", "NlmUniqueID": "0416601", "ISSNLinking": "0042-8809"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Macroglobulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2R985002CT", "NameOfSubstance": "emoxypine succinate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kallikrein-Kinin System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Peritonitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Picolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Macroglobulins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7539566"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
