Adsorption tests were performed using method ASTM D3860-98 with two types of activated carbon: powdered activated carbon and granular activated carbon. For the oxidation tests, advanced ozone oxidation technology was used. Finally, in the combined tests, firstly adsorption treatment was applied followed by oxidation and then the order was reversed. We studied the contaminant removal percentage using different treatments at various reaction times. Results for the different treatments under study showed that, for an initial atrazine concentration of 0.7\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and a dose of 16\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> of powdered activated carbon, with contact times of 60\u00a0min, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h, percentage reductions of the contaminant of 81%, 92% and 94% respectively were obtained. For the same concentration of contaminant, but instead using granular activated carbon, the percentage reduction of atrazine at 60\u00a0min was 2%, this percentage rising to 34% and 35% after 24 and 48\u00a0h of contact time, respectively. For the same initial contaminant concentration, when ozone was applied at a dose of 19.7\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and with a reaction time of 18\u00a0min, a reduction of atrazine of 93% was obtained, but oxidation by-products were also produced. For the combined treatments, with the same initial concentration of contaminant and the same doses of carbon and ozone as previously indicated, better contaminant reductions were obtained when the treatment started with activated carbon followed by ozone, achieving a 90% reduction of atrazine observing a 17\u00a0minute contact time with powdered activated carbon and a 3\u00a0day contact time using the granulated carbon. When the order was reversed by starting with ozone, the contact time was 52\u00a0min and 4\u00a0days, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
