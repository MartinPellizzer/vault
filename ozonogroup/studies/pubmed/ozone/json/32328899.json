The lung functions of 198 pupils from nine primary schools in Tianjin were examined (repeated five times) during the months of October to December in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. And the mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the effects of air pollutants. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-8h might lead to reductions of forced vital capacity (FVC) in 1.03% (-\u20091.87 to -\u20090.19%) and 21.09% (-\u200925.54 to -\u200916.58%), respectively, while a 10\u00a0ng/m<sup>3</sup> increment in ANY might account for the 166.44% (-\u2009221.32 to -\u2009112.31%) decreases in FVC. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-8h might be more harmful to the lung functions of female students and participants with PS exposure at home. And the main sources of pollution resulting in the decrease in pulmonary function might be traffic pollution and coal combustion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Health, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, No. 6 Huayue Rd., Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jingwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Health, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, No. 6 Huayue Rd., Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Lihong", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Health, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, No. 6 Huayue Rd., Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Changchun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Health, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, No. 6 Huayue Rd., Tianjin, China. guqing1014@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, No. 22 Qixiangtai Rd., Tianjin, China. guqing1014@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Geochem Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8903118", "ISSNLinking": "0269-4042"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32328899", "10.1007/s10653-020-00574-7", "10.1007/s10653-020-00574-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
