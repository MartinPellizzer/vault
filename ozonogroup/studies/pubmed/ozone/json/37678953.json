Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellants are used in all pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) and, although they are not as ozone-depleting as the earlier chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), they are potent greenhouse gases and there is a general ask for reduction in their use [1]. In this respect, respiratory doctors indirectly affect climate change through their prescription patterns [2], something only few are aware of, and which may be difficult to translate and explain to patients. To illustrate the impact of switching from pMDIs to dry powder inhalers (dMDIs) we wanted to compare climate impact of inhaler switching to climate costs of well-known items and activities in Denmark, a country with a population of 6 million inhabitants."]}], "GeneralNote": [], "PMID": "37678953", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2023", "Month": "09", "Day": "25"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2023", "Month": "09", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "09", "Day": "21"}], "ELocationID": ["2300856", "10.1183/13993003.00856-2023"], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1399-3003", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "62", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "2023", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "The European respiratory journal", "ISOAbbreviation": "Eur Respir J"}, "ArticleTitle": "Translated impact on carbon footprint from choice of inhaled therapy: a Danish scenario.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["<b>Carbon footprint of MDIs can be translated into measures that are intuitive to both patients and health professionals</b> https://bit.ly/45iVbHC"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6355-6362"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK Jorgen.Vestbo@manchester.ac.uk."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Allergy and Lung Clinic, Vanl\u00f8se, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Vestbo", "ForeName": "J\u00f8rgen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Quality and Climate, Green Transition Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Press-Kristensen", "ForeName": "K\u00e5re", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Footprint"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denmark"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interest: J.
