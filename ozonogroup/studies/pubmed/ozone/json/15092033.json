The project consisted of three major phases: a design phase, an implementation phase, and an evaluation phase. In the design phase, the system being modeled was divided into its components-transport, gas phase chemistry, aqueous phase chemistry, dry deposition and cloud processes. The formulation of the modules for each of these processes was guided by the requirement that the modules reflect the state of the art, and at the same time be consistent with the available numerical resources. In the implementation phase, submodels were constructed, and then subjected to several tests, which included mathematical consistency checks, sensitivity studies, and evaluation against field and laboratory data. The modules were then assembled and interfaced with the input data sets. The codes for the modules as well as the overall model were vectorized to take advantage of the capabilities of supercomputers such as the CRAY. The North American and West German versions of the model are being tested against data collected in North America and in Europe. This paper describes the evaluation of ADOM with data associated with a regional ozone episode in Ontario in June 1983, and measurements made during an experiment to study the scavenging characteristics of spring storms in the central and northeastern United States in April 1981."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ENSR, 1220 Avenida Acaso, Camarillo, California 93012, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venkatram", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karamchandani", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuntasal", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092033", "10.1016/0269-7491(92)90039-d", "0269-7491(92)90039-D"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
