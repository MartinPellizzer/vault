However, this practice may involve undesirable effects on human health and the environment. In 1995, methyl bromide was restricted by the Montreal Protocol because of possible ozone depletion. The objective of this study was to compare intrinsic environmental and toxicological properties of 11 active substances with nematicidal properties, some of them recognized as methyl bromide alternatives.", "Four groups of active substances were discriminated by a series of principal component analyses (PCAs): (a) high toxicity to non-target fauna, humans and animals and medium persistence in the environment (cadusafos, ethoprophos and fenamiphos); (b) high toxicity to humans, animals and non-target fauna and high persistence (carbofuran and fosthiazate); (c) low toxicity to non-target fauna, humans and animals and low persistence (carbosulfan, benfuracarb and oxamyl); (d) low toxicity to humans, animals and non-target fauna and medium persistence in the environment (1,3-dichloropropene, chloropicrin and methyl bromide).", "Evaluating the multiple aspects of toxicological and environmental properties of active substances through PCA is proposed as a helpful tool for initially comparing the complex toxicological behaviour of active substances as plant protection products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Protecci\u00f3n Vegetal, Instituto Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n y Tecnolog\u00eda Agraria y Alimentaria, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Moreno", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alonso-Prados", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alonso-Prados", "ForeName": "J Luis", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Baud\u00edn", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nematoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18823060", "10.1002/ps.1650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
