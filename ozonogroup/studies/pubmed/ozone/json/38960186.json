The results showed that O<sub>3</sub> pollution was severe with the maximum hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration reaching 150\u00a0ppb. Higher O<sub>3</sub> concentration was typically accompanied by higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, which could be ascribed to the common precursors of VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub>. The modeled averaged peak concentrations of OH, HO<sub>2</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub> were relatively higher compared to previous observations, indicating strong atmospheric oxidation capacity in the study area. The RO<sub>x</sub> production rate increased from 2.8\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> to 5\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> from the clean case to the heavily polluted case and was dominated by HONO photolysis, followed by HCHO photolysis. The contribution of radical-self combination to radical termination gradually exceeded NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0OH from clean to polluted cases, indicating that O<sub>3</sub> formation shifted to a more NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime. The O<sub>3</sub> production rate increased from 14\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> to 22\u00a0ppb\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> from clean to heavily polluted cases. The relative incremental reactivity (RIR) results showed that VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> had comparable RIR values during most days, which suggested that decreasing VOCs or NO<sub>x</sub> was both effective in alleviating O<sub>3</sub> pollution. In addition, HCHO, with the largest RIR value, made important contribution to O<sub>3</sub> production. The Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) revealed that synergistic control of O<sub>3</sub> and nitrate can be achieved by decreasing both NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs emissions (e.g., alkenes) with the ratio of 3:1. This study emphasized the importance of NO<sub>x</sub> abatement for the synergistic control of O<sub>3</sub> and nitrate pollution in the Tai'an area as the sustained emissions control has shifted the O<sub>3</sub> and nitrate formation to a more NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
