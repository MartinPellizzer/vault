Nitrous acid has two conformers (cis and trans), and we found a reaction path for the oxidation of each of these conformers with the radicals considered. In all cases, the oxidation of the cis conformer is much more favorable than the oxidation of the trans conformer. Interestingly all transition states in these oxidation processes follow a proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism. Our computed rate constant at 298 K for the reaction of cis-HONO + \u00b7OH is 4.83 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, in excellent agreement with their experimental values (4.85 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> and 6.48 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). For the trans-HONO + \u00b7OH reaction our calculated rate constant at 298 K is 9.05 \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and we computed an effective rate constant for the oxidation of the whole nitrous acid by hydroxyl radical of 1.81 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. For the oxidation of nitrous acid by chlorine atom we predict greater rate constants (7.38 \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup>, 3.33 \u00d7 10<sup>-15</sup>, and 2.76 \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, for the cis and trans conformers and for the whole HONO), these results suggesting that this reaction should contribute to the tropospheric oxidation of nitrous acid, especially in marine boundary areas, and to the formation of tropospheric ozone. For the oxidation of nitrous acid by chlorine monoxide we predict rate constants roughly 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the oxidation by chlorine atom, and therefore we consider that this process should play a minor role in the troposphere."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4526-3624"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f2gica i Modelitzaci\u00f3 Molecular, IQAC-CSIC , Jordi Girona, 18-26, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain."}], "LastName": "Anglada", "ForeName": "Josep M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament de Ci\u00e8ncia de Materials i Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica, i Institut de Qu\u00edmica Te\u00f2rica i Computacional, Universitat de Barcelona , Mart\u00ed i Franqu\u00e9s, 1, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain."}], "LastName": "Sol\u00e9", "ForeName": "Albert", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29182863", "10.1021/acs.jpca.7b10715"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
