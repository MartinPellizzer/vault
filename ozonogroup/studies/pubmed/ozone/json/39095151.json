This study explored the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of ground-level O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors based on conventional pollutant and meteorological monitoring data in Zhejiang Province from 2016 to 2021. Then, a high-performance convolutional neural network (CNN) model was established by expanding the moment and the concentration variations to general factors. Finally, the response mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> to the variation with crucial influencing factors is explored by controlling variables and interpolating target variables. The results indicated that the annual average MDA8-90<sup>th</sup> concentrations in Zhejiang Province are higher in the northern and lower in the southern. When the wind direction (WD) ranges from east to southwest and the wind speed (WS) ranges between 2 and 3 m/sec, higher O<sub>3</sub> concentration prone to occur. At different temperatures (T), the O<sub>3</sub> concentration showed a trend of first increasing and subsequently decreasing with increasing NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, peaks at the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration around 0.02 mg/m<sup>3</sup>. The sensitivity of NO<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>3</sub> formation is not easily affected by temperature, barometric pressure and dew point temperature. Additionally, there is a minimum [Formula: see text] at each temperature when the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration is 0.03 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, and this minimum [Formula: see text] decreases with increasing temperature. The study explores the response mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> with the change of driving variables, which can provide a scientific foundation and methodological support for the targeted management of O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
