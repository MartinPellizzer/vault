The application of ozone, with concentrations between 100 microg m(-3) and 2000 microg m(-3) to spruce in closed chambers yields a reduction of Rfd between 6% and 23% for the current year's needles, which indicates a reduced potential photosynthetic capacity. Further measurements on the current year's needles of spruce of the damage classes S0/S1, S2 and S3 show also a reduction of Rfd of between 7% and 14% in 2 successive years. In addition, the parameter L increases for damaged trees by between 11% and 49%, indicating a change of the chlorophyll content and of the internal energy distribution between PSI and PSII. As no effect of L can be observed with ozone fumigation, it is concluded that the change of some specifications of the PS can be simulated well by ozone fumigation (e.g. Rfd) while other specifications cannot (e.g. L)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GSF-Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Umwelt und Gesundheit, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstr. 1, W-8042 Neuherberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruth", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weisel", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091910", "10.1016/0269-7491(93)90174-m", "026974919390174M"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
