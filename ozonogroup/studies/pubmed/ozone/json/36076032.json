All studies on extracted human teeth using ozonated water were considered for the study, whereas ex vivo studies, studies on animal dentition and studies which were published in languages other than English were excluded from the study. The search was carried out on various databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect within the last 15 years. The assessment of quality of the studies was performed under the following: 1) size of sample; 2) control group; 3) standardisation of procedure; 4) statistical analysis performed; 5) risk of bias.Results There were a total of 154 study results, out of which duplicates and full-text analysis were excluded. A total of seven studies were included in the systematic review. The results in one study by Cardoso et al. showed ozonated water was better at reducing microbial counts, while two other studies demonstrated the difference in reducing microbial counts when comparing ozonated water against other irrigants. The remaining four studies concluded that ozonated water did not perform better as compared to the other irrigants such as sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine.Discussion It could be concluded that ozonated water is not a better disinfecting irrigant than sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine in the disinfection of the root canal system; however, it had an almost comparable level of disinfection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
