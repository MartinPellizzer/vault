The VOCs average mass concentrations of alkane, alkene, aromatic, acetylene, haloalkane hydrocarbons, OVOC and acetonitrile were 11.00\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 1.93\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 5.78\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 1.23\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 4.16\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 10.37\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, 0.27\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, respectively. The photochemical reaction activity was calculated by using the maximum potential coefficient of Ozone Formation Potential. Alkene and aromatic hydrocarbons were the most active components of OFP. By applying the positive matrix factorization(PMF)model, five major factors were extracted to identify the sources of NMHCs in Yixing city, including industry(42.2%),vehicle exhaust(17.9%), fuel evaporation(20.8%), paint/solvent usage(7.0%)and plant(12.1%). Combined with the conditional probability function(CPF) analysis, source of anthropogenic pollution was related to the distribution of industrial enterprises in the northwest and southeast, while the plant source was related to the forest hilly region of Southwest Yixing city. The effect of air pollutant emission reduction showed that the primary emission air pollutants had declined significantly during the strict control period from 1<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> September in G20 summit,2016, and the industry proportion was reduced to 30.5%, whereas the plant proportion increased to 16.8%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiang-Zhi", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Environmental Monitoring Center, Nanjing 210036, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yan-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yixing Environmental Monitoring Station, Yixing 214200, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Wei-Ping", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yixing Environmental Monitoring Station, Yixing 214200, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Wen-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Intelligent Environmental Sci-Tech Co., Ltd., Nanjing 211800, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wen-Tai", "Initials": "WT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964610", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201612096"]}}]}
