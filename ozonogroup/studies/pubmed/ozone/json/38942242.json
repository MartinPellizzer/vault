This method allows for the controlled production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022) while minimizing unwanted interactions with nitrogen in the air. The presence of bubbles in liquid significantly boosts the diffusion of OH\u2022 within the wastewater, leading to a two-fold increase in degradation rate compared to normal condition. The effectiveness of the treatment was confirmed through ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, which showed a significant decrease in rhodamine B and methyl orange absorbance peaks. Raman spectroscopy further revealed structural changes in both pollutants, indicating successful degradation. Additionally, plasma characteristics like power, electron temperature, and density were monitored to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism. Importantly, the process minimizes the formation of harmful secondary pollutants such as ozone and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants were found under concentration of 0.14\u00a0mg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> which is below established safety thresholds, adhering to World Health Organization guidelines. This research demonstrates that plasma jet treatment in bubble condition not only enhances the degradation efficiency of pollutants in wastewater but also minimizes the formation of harmful byproducts. This represents a significant breakthrough in developing sustainable wastewater treatment technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
