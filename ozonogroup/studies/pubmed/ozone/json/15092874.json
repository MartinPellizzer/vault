We also assessed age-related differences in O(3) flux by examining changes in leaf conductance across the life span of Norway spruce. At the leaf level O(3) flux into the needles was effectively controlled by stomatal conductance and, hence by factors such as temperature, irradiance and humidity, which control stomatal conductance. Seasonal variations in O(3) flux were mainly attributed to the course of the prevailing temperature. During the growing season, however, data have emphasised leaf-air vapour pressure difference as the environmental factor most likely to control stomatal conductance and O(3) flux into the needles. In the sun crown stomatal conductance averaged over the growing season decreased with increasing tree age from 42.0+/-3.5 mmol O(3) m(-2) s(-1) in 17-year-old trees to 7.1+/-1.0 mmol O(3) m(-2) s(-1) in 216-year-old trees, indicating that O(3) concentration in the substomatal cavities is higher in young than in old trees. Independent from tree age stomatal conductance and O(3) flux were approximately 50% lower in shade needles as compared to sun-exposed needles. Stomatal conductance was also greater in the current flush (24+/-5.6 mmol O(3) m(-2) s(-1)) and in 1-year old needles (16+/-4 mmol O(3) m(-2) s(-1)) than in older needle age classes (12+/-1 mmol O(3) m(-2) s(-1), averaged across the four older needle age classes). In trees similar in age (60-65 years old) average O(3) flux into sun needles increased from 0.55+/-0.36 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at the valley floor to 0.9 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in 1950 m a.s.l. Cumulative O(3) uptake during the vegetation period increased from 11.4+/-1.7 mol m(-2) in the valley to 14 mol m(-2) at the alpine timberline. Although stomatal conductance provides the principal limiting factor for O(3) flux, additional field research is necessary in order to improve our understanding concerning the quantitative 'physiological threshold dose' which internally can be active and can have adverse effects of O(3) on forest trees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Forest Research Centre, Division of Forest Tree Physiology, Rennweg 1, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. gerhard.wieser@uibk.ac.at"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wieser", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00e4sler", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f6tz", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koch", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Havranek", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092874", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00044-0", "S0269-7491(00)00044-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
