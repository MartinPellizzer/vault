Our study quantified the impact of five air pollutants on influenza subtype outbreaks in Shenzhen, China, a densely populated and highly urbanized megacity. Daily influenza outbreak data of laboratory-confirmed positive cases were obtained from the Shenzhen CDC, from May 1, 2013 to Dec 31, 2015. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), particulate matters \u22642.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matters \u226410\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), were retrieved from the 18 national monitoring stations. The generalized additive model (GAM) and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) were used to calculate the concentration-response relationships between environmental inducers and outbreak epidemics, respectively for influenza A (Flu-A) and B (Flu-B). There were 1687 positive specimens were confirmed during the study period. The cold season was restricted from Nov. 4th to Apr. 20th, covering all seasons other than the long-lasting summer. Relatively heavy fine particle matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and NO<sub>2</sub> pollution was observed in cold months, with mean concentrations of 46.06\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 40.03\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Time-series analysis indicated that high concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> were associated with more influenza outbreaks at short lag periods (0-5\u00a0d). Although more Flu-B (679 cases) epidemics occurred than Flu-A (382 cases) in the cold season, Flu-A generally showed higher susceptibility to air pollutants. A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> at lag 04, was associated with a 2.103 (95%CI: 1.528-2.893), 1.618 (95%CI: 1.311-1.996), and 1.569 (95%CI: 1.214-2.028) of the relative risk (RR) of Flu-A, respectively. A 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with higher risk of Flu-A at lag 03 (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.646, 95%CI: 1.295-2.092) and of Flu-B at lag 04 (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.319, 95%CI: 1.095-1.588). Nevertheless, barely significant effect of particulate matters (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) on Flu-B and SO<sub>2</sub> on both subtypes was detected. Further, the effect estimates of NO<sub>2</sub> increased for both subtypes when coexisting with other pollutants. This study provides evidence that declining concentrations of main pollutants including NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and particulate matters, could substantially decrease influenza risk in subtropical Shenzhen, especially for influenza A."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
