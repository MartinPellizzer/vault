An ozone utilization of 0.27 g/g-COD (chemical oxygen demand) lowered the pH of the wastewater to 6.6, reduced the specific ultraviolet absorption by 43% and increased the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration by 37%. The BOD:COD ratio became equal to 0.89, making the ozonated wastewater seemingly suitable for biological treatment; however, when the ozonated effluent was fed to the SBR, the reactor performance degraded, an effect which was attributed to ozonation by-products. In conclusion, ozonation might not be a suitable pre-treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater containing amoxicillin, and biotreatment with properly acclimated biomass may be a better option for treatment of such pharmaceutical wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Water Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Dr. 2, Singapore 117576 E-mail: ceelop@nus.edu.sg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lefebvre", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Water Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Dr. 2, Singapore 117576 E-mail: ceelop@nus.edu.sg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Water Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Dr. 2, Singapore 117576 E-mail: ceelop@nus.edu.sg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tein", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Water Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore, 1 Engineering Dr. 2, Singapore 117576 E-mail: ceelop@nus.edu.sg."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "804826J2HU", "NameOfSubstance": "Amoxicillin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amoxicillin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24334901", "10.2166/wst.2013.534"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
