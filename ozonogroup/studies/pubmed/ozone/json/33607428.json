This study analyses a detailed database of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in England and Wales over the period 2007-2011. Daily and annual means were considered in a 1-km spatial resolution. Histograms revealed a shape like a sawtooth. The interval was wide for NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>, although with a gap, whilst the particulate matter range was narrow. Spring provided the peak for the O<sub>3</sub> annual cycle, whereas minima for the other pollutants were reached in summer. A trend for the annual medians of particulate matter was observed, with a minimum in the period analysed. However, the pattern was uniform for NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Cities appeared as NO<sub>2</sub> hot spots and O<sub>3</sub> cold spots. Wales stood out as an NO<sub>2</sub> clean country, although with high O<sub>3</sub> levels. Sources or sinks of particulate matter were not observed, suggesting that more detailed analysis is required. Two NO<sub>2</sub> pollution axes were sometimes seen, one in the south from London to Bristol, and the second in the north, from Liverpool to Kingston Upon Hull. No annual spatial pattern was seen for the remaining pollutants beyond the contrast between cities and country sites for O<sub>3</sub>. Consequently, spatial analysis allows the real impact of pollutant sources be known, although it must be performed with a detailed temporal resolution in order to investigate the extension, quantity, and length of the concentrations calculated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
