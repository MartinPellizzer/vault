To date, it is still a challenge to simultaneously control the hydrolysis of the NbO<i><sub>x</sub></i> precursor solution and reduce the impurities of NbO<i><sub>x</sub></i> ETLs during low-temperature solution processing under ambient conditions. Herein, for the first time, we report ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) as a strong ligand to stabilize Nb salt solutions under ambient conditions. The above procedure not only enables the formation of a highly repeatable amorphous NbO<i><sub>x</sub></i> film by suppressing the hydrolysis of the solution but also reduces the OH content in the film, which decreases the defect intensity and improves the conductivity of the NbO<i><sub>x</sub></i> ETL. Thus, the formation of highly repeatable NbO<i><sub>x</sub></i> ETL-based PSCs are obtained; moreover, these PSCs have high PCE values of 19.54 and 16.42% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively, much higher than the devices based on ETLs from a solution without an O<sub>3</sub> treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9498-2399"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Qingshun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chunyang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yulin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Weidong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5659-7681"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hongru", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2001-2212"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Molecular Reaction Dynamics, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Shengye", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7318-2963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yantao", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32148020", "10.1021/acsami.0c00142"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
