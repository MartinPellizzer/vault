Nightly sleep characteristics including duration, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and efficiency were assessed using wrist actigraphy. Daily weather parameters and air pollution levels were collected from local weather station and ground-level air quality monitors. We used linear fixed effects models adjusting for participant, day of the week, and day of the year (for weather analysis), and additionally adjusted for temperature and relative humidity (for air pollution analysis).", "The participants were 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 yrs old and 86 were women.
