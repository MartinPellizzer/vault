Research on the O<sub>3</sub> formation mechanism and its precursor sources (including nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) could provide a theoretical basis for mitigating O<sub>3</sub> pollution in this region. In this study, simultaneous field experiments were conducted for air pollutants in a typical urban area (Suzhou) in the YRD region in 2022. The capacity of in-situ O<sub>3</sub> formation, O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub>X</sub>-VOCs sensitivities and sources of O<sub>3</sub> precursors were analyzed. The results showed that in-situ formation contributed 20.8\u00a0% of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the warm season (April to October) of the Suzhou urban area. Compared with the warm season average, the concentrations of various O<sub>3</sub> precursors increased on pollution days. The O<sub>3</sub>-NO<sub>X</sub>-VOCs sensitivity was the VOCs-limited regime based on the average concentrations during the warm season. O<sub>3</sub> formation was most sensitive to anthropogenic VOCs, of which oxygenated VOCs, alkenes and aromatics were the key species. There was a VOCs-limited regime in spring and autumn, while a transitional regime in summer due to the changes in NO<sub>X</sub> concentrations. This study considered NO<sub>X</sub> emission from VOCs sources and calculated the contribution of various sources to O<sub>3</sub> formation. The results of VOCs source apportionment showed that diesel engine exhaust and fossil fuel combustion had a dominant proportion, but O<sub>3</sub> formation presented significant negative sensitivities to the above two sources because of their high NO<sub>X</sub> emissions. There were significant sensitivities of O<sub>3</sub> formation to gasoline vehicle exhaust and VOCs evaporative emissions (gasoline evaporation and solvent usage). The contribution of VOCs evaporative emissions during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode was significantly higher than the average; therefore, controlling VOCs evaporative emissions during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode is critical. These results provide feasible strategies to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
