This study aimed to explore the migration and transformation of P in WAS during ozonation based on the Standards Measurements and Testing Program analysis. The results showed that WAS contained 7.10% P element and could be selected as potential substitution of phosphate rock. Inorganic phosphorus (IP) was the major P fraction in raw WAS (68.10%), and non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) occupied 62.40% of IP. Ozonation facilitated the P application in agriculture as the bio-available P in the solid phase increased by 23.63% at ozone dosage 0.20 gO<sub>3</sub>/gSS. The highest concentration of total phosphorus in liquid (TP<sub>(L)</sub>) (40.68\u00a0mg/L) was achieved at ozone dosage 0.20 gO<sub>3</sub>/gSS, and 89.62% of TP<sub>(L)</sub> was PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>-P, which was easy to be recovered by struvite precipitation. The contributions of different P fractions in solid phase to TP<sub>(L)</sub> were related to ozone dosage. The analysis of P mass balance suggested that the optimum ozone dosage for P recovery was 0.15 O<sub>3</sub>/gSS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lingxiao", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zaixing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaoshuai", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pollution Prevention Biotechnology Laboratory of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China. lyftry@126.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050018, China. lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yanfang", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "No. 17273612", "Agency": "Hebei Science and Technology Project", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AW3EJL1462", "NameOfSubstance": "Struvite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Struvite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32458303", "10.1007/s11356-020-08972-1", "10.1007/s11356-020-08972-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
