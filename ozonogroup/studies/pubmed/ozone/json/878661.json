More attention should be paid to the sectors of social and human sciences, energy, recycling and waste management, agriculture and cultivation in mountains, as well as to limits of maximum load of emissions and immissions within the field of environmental research. Dealing with immissions, one should differentiate between compounds which are already monitored and new compounds which are growing fast. In both cases occurrence, accumulation and effects have to be analyzed. In the sector of air hygiene probably the following areas are therefore the most critical: Immissions of nitrogen oxides, of specific hydrocarbons, of specific aerosols, of radioactive products and synergistic effects of several of these compounds and their interaction with natural processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merian", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Relevante Forschungsl\u00fccken auf dem Gebiet der Lufthygiene."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Soz Praventivmed", "NlmUniqueID": "7502479", "ISSNLinking": "0303-8408"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Med J Aust. 1957 Jun 15;44(24):817-21", "ArticleIdList": ["13450718"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["878661", "10.1007/BF02082958"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
