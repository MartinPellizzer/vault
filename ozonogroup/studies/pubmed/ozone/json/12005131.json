Normally a single shield gas is used. This paper describes a double shroud torch that allows used of concentric shield gases of different compositions. A solid stainless steel wire was used for welding. The double shroud torch used secondary shield gases containing small amounts of the reducing agents NO and C2H4. The Cr(VI) concentration in the fume and ozone concentration at a fixed point relative to the arc were measured and compared with results when using a single shield gas. Use of the reducing agents in secondary shielding using the double shroud torch was found to offer advantages for ozone concentration reduction compared with use in a conventional torch, but this was not found to be an advantage for reducing Cr(VI) concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, University of Bradford, UK. j.h.dennis@bradford.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dennis", "ForeName": "John H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "French", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hewitt", "ForeName": "Peter J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mortazavi", "ForeName": "Seyed B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Redding", "ForeName": "Christopher A J", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Occup Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "0203526", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4878"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18540-29-9", "NameOfSubstance": "chromium hexavalent ion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12005131", "10.1093/annhyg/mef019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
