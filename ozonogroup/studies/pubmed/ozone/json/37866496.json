Many of the persistent pollutants found in industrial effluents cannot be effectively removed by conventional treatment procedures. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising solution, offering versatile and effective means of pollutant removal and mineralization. This comprehensive review explores the application of various AOP strategies in industrial wastewater treatment, focusing on their mechanisms and effectiveness. Ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>): Ozonation, leveraging ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), represents a well-established AOP for industrial waste water treatment. Ozone's formidable oxidative potential enables the breakdown of a broad spectrum of organic and inorganic contaminants. This paper provides an in-depth examination of ozone reactions, practical applications, and considerations involved in implementing ozonation. UV/Hydrogen Peroxide (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>): The combination of ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) has gained prominence as an AOP due to its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals (\u022eH), highly efficient in pollutant degradation. The review explores factors influencing the efficiency of UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processes, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dosage and UV radiation intensity. Fenton and Photo-Fenton Processes: Fenton's reagent and Photo-Fenton processes employ iron ions and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals for pollutant oxidation. The paper delves into the mechanisms, catalyst selection, and the role of photoactivation in enhancing degradation rates within the context of industrial wastewater treatment. Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOPs): EAOPs encompass a range of techniques, such as electro-Fenton and anodic oxidation, which employ electrode reactions to produce \u022eH radicals. This review explores the electrochemical principles, electrode materials, and operational parameters critical for optimizing EAOPs in industrial wastewater treatment. TiO<sub>2</sub> Photocatalysis (UV/TiO<sub>2</sub>): Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) photocatalysis, driven by UV light, is examined for its potential in industrial wastewater treatment. The review investigates TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and the influence of parameters like catalyst loading and UV intensity on pollutant removal. Sonolysis (Ultrasonic Irradiation): High-frequency ultrasound-induced sonolysis represents a unique AOP, generating \u022eH radicals during the formation and collapse of cavitation bubbles. This paper delves into the physics of cavitation, sonolytic reactions, and optimization strategies for industrial wastewater treatment. This review offers a critical assessment of the applicability, advantages, and limitations of these AOP strategies in addressing the diverse challenges posed by industrial wastewater. It emphasizes the importance of selecting AOPs tailored to the specific characteristics of industrial effluents and outlines potential directions for future research and practical implementation. The integrated use of these AOPs, when appropriately adapted, holds the potential to achieve sustainable and efficient treatment of industrial wastewater, contributing significantly to environmental preservation and regulatory compliance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
