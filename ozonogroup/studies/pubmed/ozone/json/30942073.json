The overall rate constant ( k<sub>1</sub>) and product yields (\u03b1<sub>1a</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1b</sub>, and \u03b1<sub>1c</sub>) were determined over the atmospherically relevant temperature range of 230-294 K at 100 Torr in N<sub>2</sub>. Time-resolved kinetics measurements were performed in a pulsed laser photolysis experiment in a slow flow cell by employing simultaneous infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy. HO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub> were formed by Cl-atom reactions with CH<sub>3</sub>OH and CH<sub>3</sub>CHO, respectively. Heterodyne near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) was employed to selectively detect HO<sub>2</sub> and OH radicals. Ultraviolet absorption at 225 and 250 nm was used to detect various peroxy radicals as well as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). These experimental techniques enabled direct measurements of \u03b1<sub>1c</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1b</sub> via time-resolved spectroscopic detection in the MIR and the UV, respectively. At each temperature, experiments were performed at various ratios of initial HO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>C(O)O<sub>2</sub> concentrations to quantify the secondary chemistry. The Arrhenius expression was found to be k<sub>1</sub>( T) = 1.38<sub>-0.63</sub><sup>+1.17</sup> \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup>\u202fexp[(730 \u00b1 170)/ T] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. \u03b1<sub>1a</sub> was temperature-independent while \u03b1<sub>1b</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1c</sub> decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing temperatures. These trends are consistent with the current recommendation by the IUPAC data evaluation. Hydrogen-bonded adducts of HO<sub>2</sub> with the precursors, HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7CH<sub>3</sub>OH and HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7CH<sub>3</sub>CHO, played a role at lower temperatures; as part of this work, rate enhancements of the HO<sub>2</sub> self-reaction due to reactions of the adducts with HO<sub>2</sub> were also measured."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Physics , California Institute of Technology , M/S 127-72, 1200 East California Boulevard , Pasadena , California 91125 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4217-2698"], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Aileen O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California Institute of Technology , 4800 Oak Grove Drive , Pasadena , California 91109 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fradet", "ForeName": "Mathieu", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics, Division of Chemistry and Chemical Physics , California Institute of Technology , M/S 127-72, 1200 East California Boulevard , Pasadena , California 91125 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6874-1137"], "LastName": "Okumura", "ForeName": "Mitchio", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California Institute of Technology , 4800 Oak Grove Drive , Pasadena , California 91109 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sander", "ForeName": "Stanley P", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30942073", "10.1021/acs.jpca.9b00442"]}}]}
