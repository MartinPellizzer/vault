The present study is aimed at analyzing spatiotemporal heterogeneities and changes in trends of different aerosol optical properties observed over China. To achieve this, Collection 6 Level 3 data retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 2002-2016) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI; 2005-2016) sensors were used to investigate aerosol optical depth (AOD<sub>550</sub>), \u00c5ngstr\u04e7m exponent (AE<sub>470-660</sub>), and Absorption Aerosol Index (AAI). The spatial distribution of annual mean AOD<sub>550</sub> was noticed to be high over economically and industrialized regions of the east, south, and northeast of China, while low aerosol loadings were located over rural and less-developed areas of the west and northeast of China. High AE<sub>470-660</sub> (>\u20091.0) values were characterized by the abundance of fine-mode particles and vice versa, likely attributed to large anthropogenic activities. Similarly, high AOD with corresponding high AE and low AAI was characterized over the urban-industrialized regions of the central, east, and south of China during most of the months, being more pronounced in June and July. On seasonal scale, AOD values were found to be high during spring, followed by the summer and autumn, and low during the winter season. It is also evident that all aerosol parameters showed a single-peak frequency distribution in all seasons over entire China. Further, the annual, monthly, and seasonal spatial trends revealed a decreasing trend in AOD over most regions of China, except in the southwest of China, which showed a positive increasing trend. Significant increasing trends were noted in AAI for all the seasons, particularly during autumn and winter, resulting in a large amount of the absorbing type of aerosols produced from biomass burning and desert dust."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Centre on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters, Ministry of Education (KLME), International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC), Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Centre on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters, Ministry of Education (KLME), International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC), Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210044, China. kanike.kumar@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9376-3781"], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Kanike Raghavendra", "Initials": "KR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Centre on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters, Ministry of Education (KLME), International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC), Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210044, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Centre on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disasters, Ministry of Education (KLME), International Joint Laboratory on Climate and Environment Change (ILCEC), Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation of China Meteorological Administration, School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Sciences, Meru University of Science and Technology, P.O.
