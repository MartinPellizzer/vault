The inventory showed that evaporative emissions were high in metropolitan and urban areas because of the large populations in these areas and the high vehicle parking frequency. Using the new inventory, the sensitivity of evaporative emissions to the concentration of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol was evaluated using the chemical transport modeling solver, the community multiscale air quality modeling system (CMAQ), coupled with the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model. The calculation results showed that the evaporative emissions from permeation through fuel related parts were more significant in the generation of the tropospheric ozone than those from fuel tank venting. This was because the permeation emissions included a high proportion of high maximum incremental reactivity value components, such as aromatics. Neither of the evaporative emission types were significant secondary organic aerosol generators. Whole reduction of the evaporative emissions contributed an approximate 3 ppb decrease in tropospheric ozone in urban areas during the daytime. This information will contribute to the volatile organic compound (VOC) management strategy employed by governments worldwide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3961-5593"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tokyo Metropolitan Research Institute for Environmental Protection, 1-7-5, Sinsuna, Koto-ku, Tokyo 136-0075, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment Systems, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8563, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hata", "ForeName": "Hiroo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Science for Safety and Sustainability, The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8560, Japan."}], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Kazuya", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modern Planning Inc., 5-49-10 Chuo, Nakano-ku, Tokyo 164-0011, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kokuryo", "ForeName": "Kazuo", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1910-8508"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment Systems, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8563, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tonokura", "ForeName": "Kenichi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32298106", "10.1021/acs.est.9b06539"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
