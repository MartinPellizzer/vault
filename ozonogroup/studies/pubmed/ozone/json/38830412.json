Due to the lack of comprehensive vertical measurements of VOCs, the vertical distribution of O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity regimes has not been well understood. O<sub>3</sub> precursor sensitivity determined by ground-level measurements has been generally used to guide O<sub>3</sub> control strategy. Here, to precisely diagnose O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity regimes at different heights in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), we developed a vertical measurement system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle platform to conduct comprehensive vertical measurements of VOCs, NO<sub>X</sub> and other relevant parameters. Our results suggest that the O<sub>3</sub> precursor sensitivity shifts from a VOC-limited regime at the ground to a NO<sub>X</sub>-limited regime at upper layers, indicating that the ground-level O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity cannot represent the situation of the whole PBL. We also found that the state-of-the-art photochemical model tends to underestimate oxygenated VOCs at upper layers, resulting in overestimation of the degree of VOCs-limited regime. Therefore, thorough vertical measurements of VOCs to accurately diagnose O<sub>3</sub> precursor sensitivity is in urgent need for the development of effective O<sub>3</sub> control strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
