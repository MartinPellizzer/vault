However, the potential effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on microbes in the gut-lung axis related to lung injuries remain elusive. In this study, female mice were exposed to 0-, 0.5- and 1-ppm O<sub>3</sub> for 28\u00a0days, followed by routine blood tests, lung function tests and histopathological examination of the colon, nasal cavity and lung. Mouse faeces and lungs were collected for 16s rRNA sequencing to assess the overall microbiological profile and screen for key differential enriched microbes (DEMs). The key DEMs in faecal samples were Butyricimonas, Rikenellaceae RC9 and Escherichia-Shigella, whereas those in lung samples were DNF00809, Fluviicola, Bryobacter, Family XII AD3011 group, Sharpea, MND1 and unclassified Phycisphaeraceae. After a search in microbe-disease databases, these key DEMs were found to be associated with lung diseases such as lung neoplasms, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory distress syndrome and bronchiectasis. Subsequently, we used transcriptomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with exposure conditions similar to those in this study to cross-reference with Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). Il-6 and Ccl2 were identified as the key causative genes and were validated. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to O<sub>3</sub> leads to significant changes in the microbial composition of the gut and lungs. These changes are associated with increased levels of inflammatory factors in the lungs and impaired lung function, resulting in an increased risk of lung disease. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the role of microbes present in the gut-lung axis in O<sub>3</sub> exposure-induced lung injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
