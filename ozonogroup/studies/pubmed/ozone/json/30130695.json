The prevalence of 13 SAs, sul1, sul2 and class I integrase gene intI1 in conventional and advanced processes was investigated using HPLC-MS/MS and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. The most abundant SA was sulfamethoxazole, with the maximum concentration of 67.27\u2009ng/L. High concentration of sulfamethoxazole was also measured in finished water in both conventional (22.05\u2009ng/L) and advanced (11.24\u2009ng/L) processes. Overall, the removal efficiency of advanced process for each SA was higher than that of conventional process, except for sulfameter. The absolute concentrations of sul1, sul2 and intI1 in raw water ranged from 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>3</sup> to 2.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>5</sup> gene abundance/mL. After treatment, the residual sul ARGs and intI1 in finished water still remained at 10<sup>2</sup> - 10<sup>4</sup> gene abundance/mL. Conventional treatment units, including flocculation/sedimentation/sand filtration, played a more important role in removing sul1, sul2 and intI1 than oxidation (chlorination or ozonation) and granular activated carbon filtration treatments. Based on this work, more investigations are needed to help improve the removal of both antibiotics and ARGs in DWTPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
