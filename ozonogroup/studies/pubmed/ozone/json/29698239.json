However, post-hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (PHWW) is also produced during the process. This wastewater contains a high concentration of organic compounds, including phenols and N-heterocyclic compounds which are two main inhibitors for biological treatment. Thus, proper treatment is required. In this work, ozone was used to convert phenols and N-heterocyclic compounds with a dosage range of 0-4.64 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mL PHWW. After ozone treatment, the phenols were fully converted, and acids were produced. However, N-heterocyclic compounds were found to have a low conversion rate (21.7%). The kinetic analysis for the degradation of phenols and N-heterocyclic compounds showed that the substitute played an important role in determining the priority of ozone reactions. The OH moiety in the ring compounds (phenols and pyridinol) may form hydroxyl radical, which lead to an efficient reaction. A substantial improved biodegradability of PHWW was observed after ozone treatment. The ratio of BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD was increased by about 32.36%, and reached a maximum of 0.41. The improved biodegradability of PHWW was justified by the conversion of phenols and N-heterocyclic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China E-mail: zhouxuefei@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Libin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environment-Enhancing Energy (E2E), and Key Laboratory of Agricultural Engineering in Structure and Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China; Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Buchun", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Engenharia Agr\u00edcola, Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, Campus Universit\u00e1rio, Vi\u00e7osa, MG 36570-000, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Marcio Ar\u00eades", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watson", "ForeName": "Jamison", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China E-mail: zhouxuefei@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Huaqiang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuanhui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environment Sciences, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province 412007, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Xiaobo", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China E-mail: zhouxuefei@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xuefei", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China E-mail: zhouxuefei@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yalei", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29698239", "10.2166/wst.2018.108"]}}]}
