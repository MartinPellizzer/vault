A flat sheet ceramic membrane with the pore size of 50\u223c60\u00a0nm for ultrafiltration (UF) is used to integrate coagulation and ozonation together. At the same time, biological activated carbon filtration (BAC) is used to remove the ammonia and organic pollutants in raw water. A pilot study in the scale of 120\u00a0m(3)/d has been conducted in Southern China. The mainly-analyzed parameters include turbidity, particle counts, ammonia, total organic carbon (TOC), UV254, biological dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), dissolved oxygen (DO) as well as trans-membrane pressure (TMP). The experiments demonstrated that ceramic UF-membrane was able to remove most of turbidity and suspended particulate matters. The final effluent turbidity reached to 0.14 NTU on average. BAC was effective in removing ammonia and organic matters. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is necessary for the biodegradation of ammonia at high concentration. The removal efficiencies reached to 90% for ammonia with the initial concentration of 3.6\u00a0mg/L and 76% for TOC with the initial concentration of 3.8\u00a0mg/L. Ozonation can alter the molecular structure of organics in terms of UV254, reduce membrane fouling, and extend the operation circle. It is believed the hybrid treatment process developed in this article can achieve high performance with less land occupation and lower cost compared with the conventional processes. It is especially suitable for the developing countries in order to obtain high-quality drinking water in a cost-effective way."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Environmental Engineering and Management, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jianning", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lingyun", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Deyang", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xihui", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23705617", "10.1080/10934529.2013.781897"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
