In our research, we sought to explore the relative advantages of the liquid chromatography coupled to a time of flight mass spectrometer (LCMS-TOF) technique for the comparative time-based degradation intermediates and pathways of 4-chlorophenol (4CP) and 4-nitrophenol (4NP). The ozonation of the analytes solution (100\u2009mL of 2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> M) was done in a sintered glass reactor, with an ozone dose of 0.14\u2009mg min<sup>-1</sup> (O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> 10\u2009mL/min). The comparative oxidation results revealed that the 4-chloro- and 4-nitrocatechol pathways via hydroxylation were the major degradation route for 4CP and 4NP. Catechol intermediate was present as a primary breakdown product for the two analytes. Hydroquinone was observed as transient degradation intermediate for 4CP, but was absent for 4NP. Rather, a novel ozonation intermediate 2, 4-dinitrophenol was identified which was further oxidized to 3,6-dinitrocatechol. Several dimer products were identified in the oxidation processes, favored by alkaline conditions with more versatility shown by 4CP. The study provided a great insight into the ozone degradation intermediates and pathways, with some intermediates scarce in literature identified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Management and Toxicology, University of Benin, Benin-City, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9466-3934"], "LastName": "Akharame", "ForeName": "Michael Ovbare", "Initials": "MO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-4310-8180"], "LastName": "Fatoki", "ForeName": "Olalekan Siyanbola", "Initials": "OS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9466-3934"], "LastName": "Opeolu", "ForeName": "Beatrice Olutoyin", "Initials": "BO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Management and Toxicology, University of Benin, Benin-City, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olorunfemi", "ForeName": "Daniel Ikudayisi", "Initials": "DI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2225-2666"], "LastName": "Oputu", "ForeName": "Ogheneochuko Utieyin", "Initials": "OU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3DLC36A01X", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorophenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y92ZL45L4R", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31852365", "10.1080/10934529.2019.1701340"]}}]}
