On a local scale, exposure to high concentrations of toxic gases, such as sulphur dioxide and fluoride, result in foliar injury, branch dieback, reduced radial growth and increased mortality in a variety of tree species. On a regional scale, the photochemical oxidant, ozone, is responsible for growth decline of pollutant-sensitive eastern white pine genotypes in the eastern United States, and of ponderosa and Jeffrey pines in the mountains of southern and central California. The etiology associated with the reported declines of high elevation red spruce in the Appalachian Mountains and of sugar maple in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada is incompletely known at present. A complex of predisposing and inciting factors, including temperature and moisture stress, edaphic conditions, aluminium toxicity, insect depredation, and air-borne pollutants are probably involved in these declines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Price Hall, VPI and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24060, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chevone", "ForeName": "B I", "Initials": "BI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linzon", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092654", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90186-8", "0269-7491(88)90186-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
