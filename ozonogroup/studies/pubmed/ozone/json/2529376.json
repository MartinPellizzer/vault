The type II cells were unequivocally marked by histochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase activity in 2 microns plastic sections. By this counting method, the mean number of type II cells per lung in control rats was of the same magnitude as those reported in the literature, using point counting methods. After exposure of rats to 1.6 mg ozone/m3 for 7 days, a 50% increase in the mean number of type II cells was observed. The use of the disector method at the light microscopical level offers some advantages above a quantification at the electron microscopical level. The procedure is less time-consuming, larger areas can be screened, two parallel countings can be performed in one set of sections and there is no need for an exact knowledge about the diameter of the measured particle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Pathology, National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dormans", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Microsc", "NlmUniqueID": "0204522", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2720"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2529376", "10.1111/j.1365-2818.1989.tb02883.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
