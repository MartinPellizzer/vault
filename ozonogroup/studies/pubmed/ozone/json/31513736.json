Air pollutants have a substantial effect on respiratory health and some pollens. This study aimed to investigate relationships among airborne grass pollen, air pollutants and allergic diseases, in order to determine their effects on patients with grass pollen allergies in Beijing, China, during the period from 2013 to 2016.", "Data regarding autumnal grass pollens and air pollutants measured in Beijing from 2012 to 2016 were obtained from local governmental agencies. Patient data regarding specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) analyses from 2013 to 2016 were obtained from the Department of Allergy in Beijing Tongren Hospital. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to assess associations between the daily number of grass pollen allergen-positive patients and the following parameters: 3 clinically-relevant grass pollen genera (Artemisia, Humulus, and Chenopodium) and inhalable pollutants.", "Correlation analysis indicated that the daily number of grass pollen-positive patients was significantly associated with the peak period of grass pollens, as well as pollutants SO<sub>2</sub> and NOx. Moreover, concentrations of air pollutants (eg, ozone, oxides of nitrogen [NO<sub>x</sub> ], and SO<sub>2</sub> ) were consistently and significantly associated with concentrations of grass pollens; particulate matter 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter was negatively associated with Artemisia and Chenopodium pollens.", "Grass pollens exhibited substantial impact on allergic disease morbidity. Air pollutants impacted allergic disease and grass pollen. Thus, public health and clinical approaches to anticipate and reduce allergic disease morbidity from pollen and pollutants are needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Department of Allergy, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Affiliated to the Capital University of Medical Science, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Nasal Diseases, Beijing Institute of Otolaryngology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Yuhui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Weather Information Service, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Zhaoyin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Nasal Diseases, Beijing Institute of Otolaryngology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Nasal Diseases, Beijing Institute of Otolaryngology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Erzhong", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and Department of Allergy, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Affiliated to the Capital University of Medical Science, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Nasal Diseases, Beijing Institute of Otolaryngology, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0910-9884"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Luo", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int Forum Allergy Rhinol", "NlmUniqueID": "101550261", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6976"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chenopodium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Soza\u0144ska B, B\u0142aszczyk M, Pearce N, Cullinan P.
