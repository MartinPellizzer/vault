Therefore, a sterilization method that releases little endotoxin is required. This in vitro study aimed to compare the amounts of endotoxin released from Escherichia coli exposed to antibiotics (aminobenzylpenicillin, kanamycin, oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine and enrofloxacin) or ozone. The bacterial growth and amount of endotoxin released were measured at specific time points. Compared with antibiotic treatment, ozone sterilization induced release of smaller amounts of endotoxin from the bacteria. Moreover, no major differences were observed when ozone was used against the purified endotoxin. We conclude that compared with antibiotic treatment, ozone sterilization may release smaller amounts of endotoxin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Veterinary Surgery, United Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan. shino@urban.ne.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shinozuka", "ForeName": "Yasunori", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uematsu", "ForeName": "Kazushi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takagi", "ForeName": "Mitsuhiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taura", "ForeName": "Yasuho", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Vet Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9105360", "ISSNLinking": "0916-7250"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18460841", "10.1292/jvms.70.419", "JST.JSTAGE/jvms/70.419"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
