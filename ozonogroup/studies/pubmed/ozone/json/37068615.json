PFAS can endanger the environment and human health because of their wide application in industries, long-term persistence, unique properties, and bioaccumulation potential. This study sought to explain the accumulation of different PFAS in water bodies. In aquatic environments, PFAS concentrations range extensively from <0.03 (groundwater; Melbourne, Australia) to 51,000\u00a0ng/L (Groundwater, Sweden). Additionally, bioaccumulation of PFAS in fish and water biota has been stated to range from 0.2 (Burbot, Lake V\u00e4ttern, Sweden) to 13,900\u00a0ng/g (Bluegill samples, U.S.). Recently, studies have focused on PFAS removal from aqueous solutions; one promising technique is advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including microwaves, ultrasound, ozonation, photocatalysis, UV, electrochemical oxidation, the Fenton process, and hydrogen peroxide-based and sulfate radical-based systems. The removal efficiency of PFAS ranges from 3% (for MW) to 100% for UV/sulfate radical as a hybrid reactor. Therefore, a hybrid reactor can be used to efficiently degrade and remove PFAS. Developing novel, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable AOPs for PFAS degradation in water treatment systems is a critical area of research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
