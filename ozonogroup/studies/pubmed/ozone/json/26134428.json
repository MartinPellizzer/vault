This study aimed to investigate changes in levels of nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory markers, lipid profile, and cortisol in normal- and overweight patients with FM and controls. Since most patients with FM are overweight, we explored possible changes in these markers according to body mass index (BMI).", "This preliminary study was performed on serum samples of women with FM and age-matched controls, grouped according to their BMI: 12 normal-weight patients and 12 controls and 13 overweight patients and 8 controls. Ozone-based chemiluminescence assay was used to measure NO. Inflammatory mediators and cortisol were determined by immunoassay. Lipid profile was measured by a spectrophotometric procedure. Functional capacity was assessed by the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ).", "Normal-weight patients showed higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and apolipoprotein B compared to controls (both p < .05). CRP, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides were higher in overweight patients versus overweight controls (all p < .05) and in overweight versus normal-weight patients (CRP p < .01; apolipoprotein B, triglycerides p < .05). The other markers were unaffected. Apolipoprotein B (r = .762; p < .05) and NO (r = -.921; p < .05) levels correlated with FIQ score in normal-weight patients. CRP level correlated with FIQ (r = .912; p < .05) in overweight patients.", "CRP and apolipoprotein B, biomarkers linked to cardiovascular events, may be associated with FM-related dysfunction in normal- and overweight women with FM. Their increased levels in these patients may indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, University of Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain mrus@ujaen.es."}], "LastName": "Rus", "ForeName": "Alma", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Science, University of Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain."}], "LastName": "Molina", "ForeName": "Francisco", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analyses, Ciudad de Ja\u00e9n Hospital, Ja\u00e9n, Spain."}], "LastName": "Gass\u00f3", "ForeName": "Manuela", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Analyses, Ciudad de Ja\u00e9n Hospital, Ja\u00e9n, Spain."}], "LastName": "Camacho", "ForeName": "Maria Victoria", "Initials": "MV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, University of Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain."}], "LastName": "Peinado", "ForeName": "Maria \u00c1ngeles", "Initials": "M\u00c1"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, University of Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain."}], "LastName": "del Moral", "ForeName": "Maria Luisa", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Res Nurs", "NlmUniqueID": "9815758", "ISSNLinking": "1099-8004"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apolipoproteins B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WI4X0X7BPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocortisone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Apolipoproteins B"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibromyalgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26134428", "10.1177/1099800415591035", "1099800415591035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
