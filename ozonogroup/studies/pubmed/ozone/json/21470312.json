Solid-phase microextraction fibers (SPME) were used for sampling the terpenes and the 2-butanone formation from the hydroxyl reaction with 2-butanol as a measure of OH\u00b7 yields. Analyses were performed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The individual terpenes' OH\u00b7 yields from \u03b1-terpineol, limonene, and \u03b1-pinene were 64 \u00b1 8%, 64 \u00b1 6%, and 76 \u00b1 6%, respectively. OH\u00b7 yields were also measured from two-component mixtures of these terpenes. In each mixture that contained \u03b1-terpineol, the overall OH\u00b7 yield was lower than the modeled OH\u00b7 yields of the individual components that comprised the reaction mixture. Reactions of a commercial POC with O(3) were also studied to determine how the individual terpenes react in a complex mixture system, and an OH\u00b7 formation yield of 51 \u00b1 6% was measured. Relative humidity did not have a significant effect on the OH\u00b7 formation in the mixtures studied here.", "The data presented here demonstrate that mixtures may react differently than the sum of their individual components.
