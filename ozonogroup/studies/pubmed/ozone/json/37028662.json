Meanwhile, increasing common crop diseases, such as yellow rust, one of the most important pathogens affecting global wheat production has been detected in the area in recent decades. However, the impact of O<sub>3</sub> on the occurrence and impact of fungal diseases is scarcely understood. A close-to-field-conditions assay (Open Top Chamber facility) situated in a Mediterranean cereal rainfed farming area was carried out to study the impact of increasing O<sub>3</sub> levels and N-fertilization on spontaneous fungal outbreaks in wheat. Four O<sub>3</sub>-fumigation levels reproducing pre-industrial to future pollutant atmospheres with additional 20 and 40\u00a0nL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> over the ambient levels were considered (7\u00a0h-mean ranging from 28 to 86\u00a0nL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>). Two top N-fertilization supplementations (100 and 200\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>) were nested within the O<sub>3</sub> treatments; foliar damage, pigment content and gas exchange parameters were measured. Pre-industrial natural background O<sub>3</sub> levels strongly favored the yellow rust infection, where the O<sub>3</sub>-polluted levels currently observed at the farm highly benefited the crop, mitigating the presence of rust by 22\u00a0%. However, future expected high O<sub>3</sub>-levels neutralized the beneficial infection-controlling effect by inducing early wheat senescence, decreasing the chlorophyll index of the older leaves by up to 43\u00a0% under the higher O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Nitrogen promoted the rust infection by up to 49.5\u00a0% without interacting with the O<sub>3</sub>-factor. Achieving future air quality standards might require considering new varietal improvement programs, to be able to adapt crops to an increased pathogen tolerance without requiring the assistance provided by O<sub>3</sub>-pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
