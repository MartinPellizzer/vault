Strategies for preventing bacterial adhesion to the catheters' surfaces have been potentially shown as effective methods, such as coating thesurface with antimicrobial biomolecules. Here, novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were designed as potential biomolecules to prevent antibiotic-resistant bacteria from binding to catheter surfaces. Thiolated AMPs were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), and prep-HPLC was used to obtain AMPs with purity greater than 90%. On the other side, the silicone catheter surface was activated by UV/ozone treatment, followed by functionalization with allyl moieties for conjugation to the free thiol group of cystein in AMPs using thiol-ene click chemistry. Peptide-immobilized surfaces were found to become more resistant to bacterial adhesion while remaining biocompatible with mammalian cells. The presence and site of conjugation of peptide molecules were investigated by immobilizing them to catheter surfaces from both ends (C-Pep and Pep-C). It was clearly demonstrated that AMPs conjugated to the surface via theirN terminus have a higher antimicrobial activity. This strategy stands out for its effective conjugation of AMPs to silicone-based implant surfaces for the elimination of bacterial infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soyhan", "ForeName": "Irem", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polat", "ForeName": "Tuba", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-3027-5166"], "LastName": "Mozioglu", "ForeName": "Erkan", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozal Ilden\u0131z", "ForeName": "Tugba Arzu", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histology and Embriology, School of Medicine, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acikel Elmas", "ForeName": "Merve", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cebeci", "ForeName": "Sinan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Laboratory Technician Program, Vocational School of Health Services, Ac\u0131badem Mehmet Ali Ayd\u0131nlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4644-112X"], "LastName": "Unubol", "ForeName": "Nihan", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Atasehir, 34752 Istanbul, Turkey."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5960-2397"], "LastName": "Gok", "ForeName": "Ozgul", "Initials": "O"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "118Z859", "Agency": "The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Pharmaceutics", "NlmUniqueID": "101534003", "ISSNLinking": "1999-4923"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39204390", "10.3390/pharmaceutics16081045", "pharmaceutics16081045"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
