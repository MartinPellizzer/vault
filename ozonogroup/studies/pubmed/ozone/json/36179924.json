Ozonation, an advanced wastewater treatment technique, has been successfully implemented to enhance the removal of a broad range of pharmaceuticals, however diverse byproducts and transformation products that are formed during the ozonation process make it difficult to predict how ozonated wastewater may affect aquatic biota. The aim of this study was to investigate effects on fatty acid metabolites, oxylipins, in a common invertebrate species, damselfly larvae, after on-site exposure to conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and additionally ozonated effluent at a full-scale WWTP. Subsequent ozonation of the conventionally treated wastewater was assessed in terms of i) removal of pharmaceuticals and ii) potential sub-lethal effects on the oxylipidome. Northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) larvae were exposed for six days in the treatment plant facility to either conventional WWTP effluent or ozonated effluent and the effects on pharmaceutical levels and oxylipin levels were compared with those from tap water control exposure. Ozonation removed pharmaceuticals at an average removal efficiency of 67% (ozone dose of 0.49\u00a0g O<sub>3</sub>/g DOC). Of 38 pharmaceuticals detected in the effluent, 16 were removed to levels below the limit of quantification by ozonation. Levels of two oxylipins, 12(13)-EpODE and 15(16)-EpODE, were reduced in larvae exposed to the conventionally treated wastewater in comparison to the tap water control. 15(16)-EpODE was reduced in the larvae exposed to ozonated effluent in comparison to the tap water control. One oxylipin, 8-HETE, was significantly lower in larvae exposed to conventional WWTP effluent compared to ozonated effluent. In conclusion, the study provides proof-of-principle that damselfly larvae can be used on-site to test the impact of differentially treated wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
