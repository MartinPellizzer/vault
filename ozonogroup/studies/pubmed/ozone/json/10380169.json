Pollutant atmospheres included (a) 0.2 ppm ozone; (b) 0.4 ppm O3; (c) a low concentration mixture of ozone and sulfuric acid-coated carbon particles (0.2 ppm, 100 microg/m(3) and 50 microg/m(3), respectively); and (d) a high-concentration O3 and sulfuric acid-coated carbon particle mixture (0.4 ppm, 500 microg/m(3) and 250 microg/m(3), respectively). Following 1-day exposures to the high O3 concentration, significant (p< or =.05) decreases were observed in respiratory tidal volumes and significant increases were observed in lung inflammatory response. Following 5-day exposures to 0.4 ppm ozone, tidal volumes and lung inflammation were not significantly different from those seen in CA controls. In contrast, following 5-day exposures to the high-concentration O3-particle mixture, lung inflammation was increased significantly relative to that seen after 1-day high concentration mixture exposure or after CA exposure. Macrophage Fc-receptor binding, an important immunological function of macrophages, was significantly depressed after 5-day exposures to either the high- or low-concentration O3-particle mixtures compared to 1-day exposures or to CA. Thus, at the concentrations tested, repeated exposures to O3 produced diminished responses in breathing pattern changes and lung parenchymal injuries compared to acute, single exposures. This diminution was not observed after exposures to mixtures of acidic particles plus ozone. We conclude that mixtures of ozone and acidic particles may alter adaptive mechanisms that have been reported by us and others after repeated exposures to ozone alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community and Environmental Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1825, USA. mtkleinm@uci.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kleinman", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mautz", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bjarnason", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfuric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfuric Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10380169", "10.1080/089583799197177"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
