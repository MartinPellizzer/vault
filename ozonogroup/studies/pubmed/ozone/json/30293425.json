The temperature dependencies of species' mole fractions are quantified using molecular-beam mass spectrometry with electron ionization and single-photon ionization employing tunable synchrotron-generated vacuum-ultraviolet radiation. Upon ozone addition, significant ethylene oxidation is found in the low-temperature regime from 300 to 600 K. Here, we provide new insights into the ethylene ozonolysis reaction network via identification and quantification of previously elusive intermediates by combining experimental photoionization energy scans and ab initio threshold energy calculations for isomer identification. Specifically, the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> adduct C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is identified as a keto-hydroperoxide (hydroperoxy-acetaldehyde, HOOCH<sub>2</sub>CHO) based on the calculated and experimentally observed ionization energy of 9.80 (\u00b10.05) eV. Quantification using a photoionization cross-section of 5 Mb at 10.5 eV results in 5 ppm at atmospheric conditions, which decreases monotonically with temperature until 550 K. Other hydroperoxide species that contribute in larger amounts to the low-temperature oxidation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, like H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OOH, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OOH, are identified and their temperature-dependent mole fractions are reported. The experimental evidence for additional oxygenated species such as methanol, ketene, acetaldehyde, and hydroxy-acetaldehyde suggest multiple active oxidation routes. This experimental investigation closes the gap between ozonolysis at atmospheric and elevated temperature conditions and provides a database for future modeling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , Princeton University , Princeton , New Jersey 08544 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rousso", "ForeName": "Aric C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility , Sandia National Laboratories , Livermore , California 94551 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1375-0797"], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "Nils", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division , Argonne National Laboratory , Argonne , Illinois 60439 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0216-9347"], "LastName": "Jasper", "ForeName": "Ahren W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , Princeton University , Princeton , New Jersey 08544 , United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Yiguang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30293425", "10.1021/acs.jpca.8b06556"]}}]}
