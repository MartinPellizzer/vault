The annual concentrations of particulate matters during 2013-2017 were two times higher than the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) Grade \u2161. The annual O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased by two times during 2013-2018 in Harbin. The concentration of PM, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO depicted a similar seasonal trend with an order of winter\u00a0>\u00a0autumn\u00a0>\u00a0spring\u00a0>\u00a0summer. The consistent interannual variation trends of PM<sub>2.5</sub>/CO, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> indicated that the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols in the annual scale was dominated by the concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. The interannual variations of the individual meteorological factors causing on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> during 2013-2018 varied significantly in seasonal scale. The interannual variations were stable in annual scale indicating that the continuous decline of PM<sub>2.5</sub> during 2014-2018 can be attributed to the comprehensive and strict prohibition of small coal-fired boilers and straw burning in the study area. Meanwhile, the increase in O<sub>3</sub> during 2013-2018 in the study area were mainly attributed to the rapid growth of the emission of its precursor (VOCs and NOx). The influence of meteorology on PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone were the most stable and strongest in winter than that in the other three seasons."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
