The objective of the study is to explore whether ASC<sub>apo</sub> is stimulated by elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. The detoxification of O<sub>3</sub> by ASC<sub>apo</sub> was quantified in tobacco (Nicotiana L), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and poplar (Populus L), which were exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CF) and elevated O<sub>3</sub> treatments (E-O<sub>3</sub>). ASC<sub>apo</sub> in the three species were significantly increased by E-O<sub>3</sub> compared with the values in the filtered treatment. For all three species, E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and decreased light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A<sub>sat</sub>), suggesting that high O<sub>3</sub> has induced injury/damage to plants. E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased redox state in the apoplast (redox state<sub>apo</sub>) for all species, whereas no effect on the apoplastic dehydroascorbate (DHA<sub>apo</sub>) was observed. In leaf tissues, E-O<sub>3</sub> significantly enhanced reduced-ascorbate (ASC) and total ascorbate (ASC+DHA) in soybean and poplar, but significantly reduced these in tobacco, indicating different antioxidative capacity to the high O<sub>3</sub> levels among the three species. Total antioxidant capacity in the apoplast (TAC<sub>apo</sub>) was significantly increased by E-O<sub>3</sub> in tobacco and poplar, but leaf tissue TAC was significantly enhanced only in tobacco. Leaf tissue superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) in poplar and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in tobacco and soybean were significantly increased by E-O<sub>3</sub>. The diurnal variation of ASC<sub>apo</sub>, with maximum values occurring in the late morning and lower values experienced in the afternoon, appeared to play an important role in the harmful effects of O<sub>3</sub> on tobacco, soybean and poplar."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
