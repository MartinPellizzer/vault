The ligand-exchange reactions were investigated using in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Consistent with our previous work on ALD of Al(2)O(3) from an O(2) plasma and O(3) [Rai, V. R.; Vandalon, V.; Agarwal, S. Langmuir 2010, 26, 13732], both -OH groups and carbonates were the chemisorption sites for TMA over the entire temperature range explored. The concentration of surface -CH(3) groups after the TMA cycle was, however, strongly dependent on the surface temperature and the type of oxidizer, which in turn influenced the corresponding growth per cycle. The combustion of surface -CH(3) ligands was not complete at 70 \u00b0C during O(3) exposure, indicating that an O(2) plasma is a relatively stronger oxidizing agent. Further, in O(3)-assisted ALD, the ratio of mono- and bidentate carbonates on the surface after O(3) exposure was dependent on the substrate temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado 80401, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Vikrant R", "Initials": "VR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vandalon", "ForeName": "Vincent", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agarwal", "ForeName": "Sumit", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22081861", "10.1021/la201136k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
