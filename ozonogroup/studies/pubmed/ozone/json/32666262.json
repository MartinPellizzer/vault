Therefore, the present study was conducted to compare the bacterial community and diversity in the two swimming pools disinfected by the chlorine and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)-chlorine processes. A total of 24 samples were taken from the two swimming pools in three distinct seasons to analyze the bacterial and physico-chemical indicators. Culture and molecular methods were used to evaluate the microbial quality. Two sets of sample taken from the pools with the maximum swimmer load in the summer were investigated by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. In total, 410 and 406 bacterial species were identified in the chlorine- and ozone-chlorine-disinfected pools, respectively. Among the eight dominant bacterial species in each swimming pool, Pseudomonas alcaliphila, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas acnes were common species between the two studied pools. Oleomonas sagaranensis (350 reads/18593), Staphylococcus caprae (302 reads /18593), and Anaerococcus octavius (110 reads/18593) were among the dominant bacteria in the chlorine-disinfected pool. Bacterial diversity was lower in the ozone-chlorine-disinfected pool than the other one, and the highest bacterial sequencing belonged to the genus Pseudomonas (85.79%). Results showed that water quality of in O<sub>3</sub>-chlorine-disinfected pool was more desirable than the chlorine-disinfected pool. Molecular methods along with conventional culture methods would be advantageous for microbial assessment in the swimming pools."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Firuzi", "ForeName": "Parisa", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asl Hashemi", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Samadi Kafil", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholizadeh", "ForeName": "Pourya", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5427-9647"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health and Environment Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. haslani@tbzmed.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Aslani", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Anaerococcus octavius", "Oleomonas sagaranensis", "Pseudomonas alcaliphila", "Staphylococcus caprae"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetobacteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Firmicutes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming Pools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32666262", "10.1007/s10661-020-08470-4", "10.1007/s10661-020-08470-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
