These abnormal changes were reversed by SF treatment, which was manifested as the significantly raised activities of SOD and GSH-Px after treatment with high and moderate doses of SF, showing a significant difference compared with those in the model group (P<0.01). Membranous lipo-microviscosity basically approached that in the control group (P>0.05); electron microscopic examination showed a basically normal morphological structure of pulmonary epithelial cells, with the change in lung injury significantly milder than that in the model group.", "O3 could induce oxidative injury of lungs in mice, and SF could enhance the anti-oxidation capacity of mice and scavenge the oxygen free radicals so as to alleviate the injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical College of Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, 225001, China. jgz7718@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "De-jun", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Wei-dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Xiao-jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Chin J Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101181180", "ISSNLinking": "1672-0415"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AVM951ZWST", "NameOfSubstance": "ferulic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "enzymology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2004 Dec;24(12):1103-5", "ArticleIdList": ["15658655"]}, {"Citation": "Chin J Integr Med. 2006 Dec;12(4):297-300", "ArticleIdList": ["17361528"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1978 Dec 15;515(4):367-94", "ArticleIdList": ["365237"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17898953", "10.1007/s11655-007-0211-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
