The findings demonstrated that 1,4-dioxane was detected in about 80.0\u00a0% samples with values ranging from n.d. to 7757\u00a0ng/L in source water and n.d. to 2918\u00a0ng/L in drinking water. 1,4-Dioxane showed limited removal efficiency using conventional coagulation-sedimentation-filtration processes (14\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0%), and a removal efficiency of 35\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a044\u00a0% using ozonation-biological activated carbon advanced treatment processes. Relatively higher concentrations, detection frequency and environmental risk were observed in Taihu Lake, Yellow River, Yangtze River, Zhujiang River, and Huaihe River mainly in the eastern and southern regions, where there are considerable industrial activities and comparatively high population densities. The widespread presence as by-products during manufacturing consumer products e.g., ethoxylated surfactants, suggested municipal wastewater discharges were the dominant source for the ubiquitous occurrence of 1,4-dioxane, while industrial activities, e.g. resin manufacturing, also contribute considerably to the elevated concentrations of 1,4-dioxane. The estimated risk quotients were in the range of <1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> for ecological risk, <5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup> by oral exposure and\u00a0<\u00a05.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup> by inhalation exposure for health risk, illustrating limited ecological harm to water environment or chronic toxicity to human health. For carcinogenic risk, 1,4-Dioxane presented a mean risk of 1.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-6</sup> by oral exposure, which slightly surpassed the recommended acceptable levels of U.S. EPA (<10<sup>-6</sup>), and risk from inhalation exposure could be negligible. The pervasiveness in drinking water, low removal efficiencies during water treatment processes, and suspected health impacts, highlighted the necessity to set related water quality standards of 1,4-dioxane in order to improve water environment in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
