To test the hypothesis that heavy sustained exercise would elicit pulmonary dysfunction on exposure to 0.60 ppm NO2 and/or enhance the effects of exposure to 0.30 ppm O3, 40 aerobically trained young adults (20 males and 20 females) completed 1 h of continuous exercise at work rates eliciting a mean minute ventilation of 70 and 50 l/min for the males and females, respectively. Exposures to filtered air, 0.60 ppm NO2, 0.30 ppm O3, and 0.60 ppm NO2 plus 0.30 ppm O3 were randomly delivered via an obligatory mouthpiece inhalation system. Treatment effects were assessed by standard pulmonary function tests and exercise ventilatory and subjective symptoms response. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and post hoc analyses revealed a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) effect of O3 on forced expiratory parameters, specific airway resistance, exercise ventilatory response, and reported subjective symptoms of respiratory discomfort. In contrast, no significant effect of NO2 was observed nor was there any significant interaction of NO2 and O3 in combination. There were no significant differences between male and female responses to gas mixture treatments. It was concluded that inhalation of 0.60 ppm NO2 for 1 h while engaged in heavy sustained exercise does not elicit effects evidenced by measurement techniques used in this study nor evoke additive effects beyond those induced by 0.30 ppm O3 in healthy young adults."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adams", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brookes", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Concept"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3597241", "10.1152/jappl.1987.62.4.1698"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
