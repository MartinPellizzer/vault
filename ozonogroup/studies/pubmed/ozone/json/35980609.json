Twenty-four, Wistar Hannover rats were included. The rats were divided into three groups as control, detorsion-only, and ozone therapy\u2009+\u2009detorsion groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the follicular damage and inflammation scores between the study groups (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.019, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.002, respectively). The highest AMH decrease was observed in the detorsion-only group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.012). The total damage score was higher in the detorsion-only group than the ozone therapy\u2009+\u2009detorsion group. Preantral, small and large antral follicle numbers were less in the detorsion-only group than the ozone therapy\u2009+\u2009detorsion group. The highest postoperative day 7 TAS level was in the ozone therapy\u2009+\u2009detorsion group. TOS levels did not differ significantly between the study groups. The combination of the ozone therapy with ovarian detorsion is more effective in protecting the ovarian reserve than ovarian detorsion-only.Impact Statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> Adnexal torsion is a common gynecological emergency in reproductive-age women. The recommended management is the detorsion of the adnexal pedicle in patients with fertility desire.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> The combination of the medical ozone therapy with conventional surgical ovarian detorsion is more effective in the protection of the ovarian reserve compared to surgical ovarian detorsion.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> This study speculates that medical ozone therapy in addition to conventional surgical ovarian detorsion could preserve ovarian reserve and function if confirmed in further clinical studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9482-5481"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "S\u00fczen \u00c7ayp\u0131nar", "ForeName": "Sema", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Health Sciences, Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karaka\u015f", "ForeName": "Sema", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4175-7694"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Health Sciences, Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kaya", "ForeName": "Cihan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Health Sciences, Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sak\u0131z", "ForeName": "Damlanur", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Esenyurt, Esencan Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sezer", "ForeName": "Salim", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Health Sciences, Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ekin", "ForeName": "Murat", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Obstet Gynaecol", "NlmUniqueID": "8309140", "ISSNLinking": "0144-3615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35980609", "10.1080/01443615.2022.2109130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
