Probabilistic versions of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) Exposure Model (pNEM) have been used to estimate the exposures of urban populations to carbon monoxide and ozone. An enhanced version of the Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure Model (HAPEM-MS) has been used to develop city-specific estimates of exposure to benzene and other volatile organic compounds emitted by mobile sources. These models are similar in that each contains algorithms that simulate microenvironmental pollutant levels, time/activity patterns, and commuting patterns. The pNEM models also provide estimates of equivalent ventilation rate (EVR), defined as ventilation rate divided by body surface area. This paper summarizes the methods and results of selected research projects conducted since 1991 with the goal of improving pNEM, HAPEM-MS, and similar exposure models applicable to mobile source pollutants. The studies include: (1) the development of an improved algorithm for estimating EVR, (2) a field study to measure ozone levels near roadways and inside vehicles, (3) the development of an algorithm for estimating school commuting patterns, and (4) the construction of a comprehensive database containing time/activity data from ten activity diary studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IT Air Quality Services, International Technology Corporation, Durham, North Carolina 27701, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9111438", "ISSNLinking": "1053-4245"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monte Carlo Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "NumberOfReferences": "39"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8938249"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
