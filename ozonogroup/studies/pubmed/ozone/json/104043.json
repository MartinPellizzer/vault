One group of animals was sacrificed at the end of the last exposure day and another group was sacrificed 4 d later after the last exposure. Evidence was sought for oxidation-induced changes known to occur in rodents when high levels of O3 are inhaled. A significant increase in red blood cell membrane fragility was observed, as well as significant decreases in red blood cell glutathione and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase; however, the red blood cell enzymes, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were not changed significantly. Lung tissue analysis showed that lipid peroxidation was markedly increased and tissue vitamin E levels were significantly decreased. The tissue enzymes G6PDH, glutathione reductase, and LDH significantly increased in activity. No significant changes were seen in either superoxide dismutase or malic acid dehydrogenase. The results of this experiment indicate that O3, or reaction products resulting from O3-tissue interaction in the lung, pass the air-blood barrier and are capable of producing biochemical changes in blood as well as in lung tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Posin", "ForeName": "C I", "Initials": "CI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buckley", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.37", "NameOfSubstance": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.49", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haplorhini"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saimiri"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["104043", "10.1080/15287397809529696"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
