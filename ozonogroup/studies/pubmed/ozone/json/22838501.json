This study correlates exacerbation frequency with proximity to roadways and two criteria air pollutants. Clinical data was extracted from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry and Electronic Medical Records at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). Average annual air pollutant levels were obtained from selected US Environmental Protection Agency's monitoring stations. Geographic proximity to monitoring stations and roadways were analyzed using spatial mapping software. A total of 145 patients from the CHLA's CF center were characterized by a dichotomous exacerbation category. No significant association was determined between the frequency of exacerbations and exposure to fine particulate matter and ozone levels. Residential proximity to US-designated highways and freeways also did not achieve significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.3777) but was noted to be correlated with major arterial roadways (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0420). Associations of environmental exposures may have important implications for future predictive models of CF clinical outcomes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics , Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles , USA. mjassa01@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jassal", "ForeName": "Mandeep S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Albert M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhatia", "ForeName": "Rajeev", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keens", "ForeName": "Thomas G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davidson Ward", "ForeName": "Sally L", "Initials": "SL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "T32 HL072748", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cystic Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Motor Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22838501", "10.1080/09603123.2012.708917"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
