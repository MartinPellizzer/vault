The mineral matter present in the activated carbon positively contributes to its activity to enhance DMP ozonation process. A higher dipping Ce(NO(3))(3) concentration and calcination process increase its microporous volume and surface area, and decreases its exterior surface area. The catalytic activity reaches optimal when 0.2% (w/w) cerium is deposited on activated carbon. Ce/AC catalyst was characterized by XRD, SEM and BET. The presence of either activated carbon or Ce/AC catalyst considerably improves their degradation and mineralization in the ozonation of DMP. During the ozonation (50mg/h ozone flow rate) of a 30 mg/L DMP (initial pH 5.0) with the presence of Ce/AC catalyst, TOC removal rate reaches 68% at 60 min oxidation time, 48% using activated carbon as catalyst, only 22% with ozonation alone. The presence of tert-butanol (a well known OH radical scavenger) strongly inhibits DMP degradation by activated carbon or Ce/AC catalytic ozonation. TOC removal rate follows the second-order kinetics model well. In the ozonation of DMP with 50mg/h ozone flow rate, its mineralization rate constant with the presence of Ce/AC catalyst is 2.5 times higher than that of activated carbon, 7.5 times higher than that of O(3) alone. Ce/AC catalyst shows the better catalytic activity and stability based on 780 min sequential reaction in the ozonation of DMP. Ce/AC was a promising catalyst for ozonizing organic pollutants in the aqueous solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China. llsh@scnu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Laisheng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Weiying", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiuyun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Fengqiang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xukai", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "08X7F5UDJM", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethyl phthalate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phthalic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19467775", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.04.081", "S0304-3894(09)00663-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
