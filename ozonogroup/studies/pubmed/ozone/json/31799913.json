Today, sophisticated gridded high-resolution meteorological models are used to produce meteorological fields that drive chemical transport models for air quality management. Errors in specification of the physical atmosphere such as temperature, clouds and winds can affect the air quality predictions. Additionally, the efficiency and efficacy of emission control strategies can be compromised by errors in the meteorological fields. In this paper, the role of meteorology in air quality behavior, primarily from the viewpoint of regional ozone modeling as carried out in the U.S., is reviewed. Particular attention is given to physics and new techniques for improving meteorological model performance. Uncertainties in model turbulent mixing in the nighttime boundary layer, where large model differences exist, are examined. The role of spatial mesoscale features such as topography and land/water systems in models are discussed. The nocturnal low-level jet, a mesoscale temporal and spatial feature, and its impact on air quality are examined. Traditional air quality concerns have focused on synoptic conditions at the center of high-pressure systems. However, high ozone levels have also been associated with stationary fronts. The ability of models to capture mesoscale structure and yet retain synoptic structure and its timing is challenging. Data assimilation and its ability to improve model performance are examined. Particular attention is given to vertical nudging strategies that can affect formation of the nocturnal low-level jets. Finally, clouds can have a major impact on air quality since insolation impacts temperature, biogenic emissions and photolysis rates and extremes in stability. Traditional techniques, which attempt to insert cloud water where there is not dynamical support, can lead to additional errors. New dynamical approaches for improving model cloud performance are discussed.<i>Implications</i>: This article shows that there has been a considerable improvement in meteorological models used for air quality simulations. In particular, improvement in the tools for incorporating both traditional observations and new satellite data for retrospective studies has been beneficial to air quality community. However, while this trend is continuing, many challenges remain. As an example, due to having many options available in configuring a model simulation, there is a need to evaluate and recommend sets of options that provide important performance measures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McNider", "ForeName": "Richard T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pour-Biazar", "ForeName": "Arastoo", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31799913", "10.1080/10962247.2019.1694602"]}}]}
