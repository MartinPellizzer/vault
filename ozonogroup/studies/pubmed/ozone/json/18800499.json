In Germany, DMS was found in groundwaters and surface waters with typical concentrations in the range of 100-1000 ng/L and 50-90 ng/L, respectively. Laboratory-scale and field investigations concerning its fate during drinking water treatment showed that DMS cannot be removed via riverbank filtration, activated carbon filtration, flocculation, and oxidation or disinfection procedures based on hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, chlorine dioxide, or UV irradiation. Even nanofiltration does not provide a sufficient removal efficiency. During ozonation about 30-50% of DMS are converted to the carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The NDMA being formed is biodegradable and can at least partially be removed by subsequent biologically active drinking water treatment steps including sand or activated carbon filtration. Disinfection with hypochlorous acid converts DMS to so far unknown degradation products but not to NDMA or 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Analysis Department, DVGW-Water Technology Center (TZW), Karlsruher Str. 84, 76139 Karlsruhe, Germany. ca.schmidt@rheinenergie.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "Carsten K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brauch", "ForeName": "Heinz-J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18800499", "10.1021/es7030467"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
