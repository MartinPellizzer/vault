As the impact of lockdown, the major causes of air pollution were ceased which resulted in cleaner blue skies and hence improving the air quality standards. This paper presents an analysis of air quality particulate matter (PM)2.5, PM10, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Air quality index (AQI). The analysis indicates that the PM10 AQI value drops impulsively from (40-45%), compared before the lockdown period, followed by NO2 (27-35%), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (2-10%), PM2.5 (35-40%), but the Ozone (O3) rises (12-25%). To regulate air quality, many steps were taken at national and regional levels, but no effective outcome was received yet. Such short-duration lockdowns are against economic growth but led to some curative effects on AQI. So, this paper concludes that even a short period lockdown can result in significant improvement in Air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
