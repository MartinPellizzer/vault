The total mortality data were analyzed to estimate the impact of the COVID\u201119 related lockdown measures on the burden of health in a given population, attributed to the outdoor air quality in the City of Novi Sad, using AirQ+ software.", "The average daily concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were reduced by 35%, 34%, 23% and 18%, respectively. In contrast, the average daily concentration of O<sub>3</sub> increased by 8%, even if the primary precursors were reducing, thus representing a challenge for air quality management. In the City of Novi Sad, a reduction in the average daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of 11.23 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was significant, which resulted in a quantified number of avoided deaths.", "Air pollution in the City of Novi Sad had a chance to be improved due to some preventive measures related to the infectious disease (the COVID\u201119 related lockdown), which in turn was the mitigation measure to air pollution with positive public health effects. The confirmed positive effects of the improved air quality on public health could also include raising collective resistance to mass non-communicable and infectious diseases such as COVID\u201119 and reducing economic costs.
