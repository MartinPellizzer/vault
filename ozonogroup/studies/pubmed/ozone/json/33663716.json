In experiment 1, P.\u00a0insidiosum was treated with ozonated distilled water, ozonated sunflower oils with distinct peroxide indexes or O<sub>3</sub> gas (72\u00a0\u03bcg O<sub>3</sub> mL<sup>-1</sup>). In experiment 2, samples were exposed one or three times to oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) or O<sub>3</sub> gas (72\u00a0\u03bcg O<sub>3</sub> mL<sup>-1</sup>; 30\u00a0min/day). In experiment 3, P.\u00a0insidiosum was treated with different concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> gas (\u00d8, 32, 52, or 72\u00a0\u03bcg O<sub>3</sub> mL<sup>-1</sup>) for three days (30\u00a0min/day). In experiment 4, samples were exposed to O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> gas (72\u00a0\u03bcg O<sub>3</sub> mL<sup>-1</sup>) for 05, 15, or 30\u00a0minutes during three days. Posteriorly, all samples were cultured for two weeks, and the pathogen growth area was measured until D14. Samples with absence of growth on D14 were recultured to assess the germicidal or germistatic action of the treatment. In experiment 1, only ozonized sunflower oil with a high peroxide index had germicidal action against the pathogen. In experiment 2, samples exposed three times to O<sub>3</sub> gas were inactivated. In experiment 3, the O<sub>3</sub> therapy had germicidal action against P.\u00a0insidiosum independently of the gas concentration (P > .1). In experiment 4, O<sub>3</sub> treatments \u226515\u00a0minutes suppressed the pathogen development, whereas samples exposed to O<sub>3</sub> gas for 5\u00a0minutes had progressive growth (P < .01). In conclusion, ozonated sunflower oil with a high peroxide index and multiple exposures to O<sub>3</sub> gas mixtures were able to inactivate P.\u00a0insidiosum isolated from horses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
