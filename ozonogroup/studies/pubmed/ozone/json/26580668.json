However, information on the relationship between exposure to levels of coarse particles (PM(2.5-10)) and daily mortality rate is relatively sparse due to limited availability of monitoring data and findings are inconsistent. This study was undertaken to determine whether an association exists between PM(2.5-10) levels and rate of daily mortality in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, a large industrial city with a tropical climate. Daily mortality rate, air pollution parameters, and weather data for Kaohsiung were obtained for the period 2006-2008. The relative risk (RR) of daily mortality occurrence was estimated using a time-stratified case-crossover approach, controlling for (1) weather variables, (2) day of the week, (3) seasonality, and (4) long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model without adjustment for other pollutants, PM(2.5-10) exposure levels showed significant correlation with total mortality rate both on warm and cool days, with an interquartile range increase associated with a 14% (95% CI = 5-23%) and 12% (95% CI = 5-20%) rise in number of total deaths, respectively. In two-pollutant models, PM(2.5-10) exerted significant influence on total mortality frequency after inclusion of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) on warm days. On cool days, PM(2.5-10) induced significant elevation in total mortality rate when SO(2) or ozone (O(3)) was added in the regression model. There was no apparent indication of an association between PM(2.5-10) exposure and deaths attributed to respiratory and circulatory diseases. This study provided evidence of correlation between short-term exposure to PM(2.5-10) and increased risk of death for all causes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Healthcare Administration , I-Shou University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Shang-Shyue", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Chang Gung University College of Medicine , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Yi-Hao", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Master Program in Global Health and Development, College of Public Health and Nutrition, Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Public Health , College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine , National Health Research Institute , Miaoli , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26580668", "10.1080/15287394.2015.1093674"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
