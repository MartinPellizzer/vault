However, the simulations of isoprene emissions have not been sufficiently verified over Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and few studies have specifically addressed its impact on O<sub>3</sub> formation. In this study, we simulated the isoprene emissions in Zhejiang Province (ZJ), a region with the largest BVOC emission in YRD, in August 2020 using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) and the latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, and investigated its contributions to O<sub>3</sub> using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The model has a good performance on isoprene simulations over urban and suburban areas, with mean biases of -0.16-0.12 ppb, but underestimated the concentrations at forest sites (mainly due to bamboo). Regionally, the simulated formaldehyde concentrations over forests agree well with the satellite observations. In August 2020, the total isoprene emission in ZJ was 125.1 GgC, with higher emissions in western ZJ and relatively lower emissions in eastern coastal regions. The spatial pattern of isoprene concentrations is similar to its emissions, and the maximum daytime average concentrations are above 3.5 ppb. The spatial pattern of its contribution to daily maximum 8 h average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations is significantly different from the emissions and concentrations, which shows a higher impact in northern ZJ (>6 ppb) and relatively lower impact in southern ZJ (1-3 ppb). The mean contribution over ZJ is 8.9 %, with daily variation in the range of 3.1 % to 13.4 %. For different cities, the monthly mean contribution is in the range of 4.6 % to 14.3 %, and the maximum daily contribution reaches about 25 %. These findings help understand the summertime O<sub>3</sub> pollution in ZJ and the YRD region of China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
