The rate of increase, although uncertain, is about 6 percent per year on average. Human activities are the likely cause of a substantial portion of this observed increase; however, because of the short atmospheric lifetime of carbon monoxide and the relatively few years of observations, fluctuations of sources and sinks related to the natural variability of climate may have affected the observed trend. Increased carbon monoxide may deplete tropospheric hydroxyl radicals, slowing down the removal of dozens of man-made and anthropogenic trace gases and thus indirectly affecting the earth's climate and possibly the stratospheric ozone layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17783521", "10.1126/science.224.4644.54", "224/4644/54"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
