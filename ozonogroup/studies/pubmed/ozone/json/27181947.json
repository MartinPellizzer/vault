While UV-B photoreceptor mediated signaling is increasingly understood, the role of UV-B inducible reactive oxygen species is still to be explored. Earlier experiments with high UV-B irradiation doses and isolated thylakoid membranes demonstrated the potential of UV-B to trigger oxidative stress. However, under realistic UV conditions pro-oxidants cannot be reliably traced in more complex biological samples possessing an array of antioxidant defenses. In the absence of direct experimental evidence we must rely on indications and propose hypotheses on how and whether pro-oxidants, such as reactive oxygen species contribute to acclimative responses. Here we briefly review how a balance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants is affected by UV-B in whole plant experiments performed in controlled environments. A working hypothesis is proposed in which the extents of UV-induced peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activations affect the success of acclimation to UV-B."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
