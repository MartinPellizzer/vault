To date, very few studies have assessed the combined effects of exposure to multiple air pollutants on breast cancer (BC) risk.", "We aimed to assess the association between combined exposures to multiple air pollutants and breast cancer risk.", "The study was based on a case-control study nested within the French E3N cohort (5222 incident BC cases/5222 matched controls). For each woman, the average of the mean annual exposure to eight pollutants (benzo(a)oyrene, cadmium, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB153), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone, particulate matter and fine particles (PMs)) was estimated from cohort inclusion in 1990 to the index date. We used the Bayesian Profile Regression (BPR) model, which groups individuals according to their exposure and risk levels, and assigns a risk to each cluster identified. The model was adjusted on a combination of matching variables and confounders to better consider the design of the nested case-control study. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95\u00a0% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated.", "Among the 21 clusters identified, the cluster characterised by low exposures to all pollutants, except ozone, was taken as reference. A consistent increase in BC risk compared to the reference cluster was observed for 3 clusters: cluster 9 (OR=1.61; CrI=1.13,2.26), cluster 16 (OR=1.59; CrI=1.10,2.30) and cluster 15 (OR=1.38; CrI=1.00,1.88) characterised by high levels of NO<sub>2</sub>, PMs and PCB153. The other clusters showed no consistent association with BC.", "This is the first study assessing the effect of exposure to a mixture of eight air pollutants on BC risk, using the BPR approach. Overall, results showed evidence of a positive joint effect of exposure to high levels to most pollutants, particularly high for NO<sub>2</sub>, PMs and PCB153, on the risk of BC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
