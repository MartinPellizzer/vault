A whole range of human activities has been suspended Monday 17 March 2020 in all French regions. Since then experiments are progressing to reflect the effectiveness of reduced emissions. In this paper, we looked at variations of pollutants prior to, during and after containment period. In a first step, we proved through experiments on eight air pollutants, how all daily maximum pollutants concentration have decreased during containment phase, apart from the ozone pollutant O<sub>3</sub>. This Ozone pollutant has indeed increased by 27.19% during lockdown period and kept growing by 21.35% as well right after deconfinement. Indeed, the maximum daily concentrations detected in different regions of France, have decreased by 18.18%, 37.14%, 20.36%, 9.28%, 44.38%, 5.1% and 44.38%, respectively, for the pollutants SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, NOX, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. Declining levels of other pollutants, however, were not sustained after deconfinement for NO<sub>2</sub>, NOX and PM<sub>10</sub>. We have reinforced these findings by classifying each pollutant according to the ATMO and AQI indexes, to better visualize their criticality throughout the three lockdown phases (Pre/During/Post). The family of air pollutant variables with their associated geographical sources was thereafter exploited to justify their approximate contribution to the daily mortality rates associated to COVID-19 across all French regions. However, more thorough study is still in progress to validate this finding. Finally, coming up to the abrupt changes in airborne pollutants experienced in this period, a question about future climate crisis was raised again. Whereby a weighting study has shown the current and very short-term French scenario (Status-Quo) in view of its current environmental path, the political responses made towards future climate change crisis and French investments done in this sense."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8675-5636"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Foundation for Development and Innovation in Science and Engineering, 16469 Casablanca, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.412148.a", "0000 0001 2180 2473"], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Laboratory (LRI), System Architecture Team (EAS), National and High School of Electricity and Mechanic (ENSEM), Hassan II University, 8118 Casablanca, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.462149.c", "0000 0001 0018 053X"], "Affiliation": "EIGSI, La Rochelle, France."}], "LastName": "Ikhlasse", "ForeName": "Hamzaoui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.462149.c", "0000 0001 0018 053X"], "Affiliation": "EIGSI, La Rochelle, France."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.11698.37", "0000 0001 2169 7335"], "Affiliation": "Computer, Image and Interaction Laboratory (L3i), University of La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France."}], "LastName": "Benjamin", "ForeName": "Duthil", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.11698.37", "0000 0001 2169 7335"], "Affiliation": "Computer, Image and Interaction Laboratory (L3i), University of La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France."}], "LastName": "Vincent", "ForeName": "Courboulay", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Foundation for Development and Innovation in Science and Engineering, 16469 Casablanca, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.412148.a", "0000 0001 2180 2473"], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Laboratory (LRI), System Architecture Team (EAS), National and High School of Electricity and Mechanic (ENSEM), Hassan II University, 8118 Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Hicham", "ForeName": "Medromi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Dev Sustain", "NlmUniqueID": "101769312", "ISSNLinking": "1387-585X"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Agence de la transition \u00e9cologique - ADEME.
