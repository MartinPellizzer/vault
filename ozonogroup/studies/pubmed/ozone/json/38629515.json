Based on online observations of O<sub>3</sub>, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>), and meteorological elements from April to September 2020 at an urban site in Beijing, we analyzed the pollution characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, explored key factors affecting O<sub>3</sub> using the random forest (RF) model combined with SHAP values, and explored the O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> sensitivity through a multi-scenarios analysis. The results of correlation analysis showed that the hourly concentration of O<sub>3</sub> was significantly positively correlated with temperature (<i>T</i>) and negatively correlated with TVOCs and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>. However, in terms of the daily values, O<sub>3</sub> was significantly positively correlated with <i>T</i>, TVOCs, and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>. The simulated O<sub>3</sub> values by the RF model agreed with the measured values. The SHAP values of each characteristic variable were further calculated. The results suggested that <i>T</i> and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> showed the two highest effects on O<sub>3</sub>, with positive and negative values, respectively. Based on the average NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and VOCs on O<sub>3</sub> pollution days during the observation period (the base scenario), multi-scenarios with different NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and VOCs were set up. The RF model was used to calculate O<sub>3</sub> under different scenarios and obtain the O<sub>3</sub> isopleth (EKMA curve). The results showed that the O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> sensitivity in urban areas of Beijing was in the VOCs-limited regime, which was consistent with the results obtained from the observation-based box model(OBM). This indicated that the RF model could be used as a complementary method for O<sub>3</sub>-VOCs-NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> sensitivity analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Environmental Monitoring Centre, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Wen-Xuan", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Intelligent Environmental Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing 211800, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38629515", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202306034"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
