In this type of areas citizen science strategies can be useful tools for awareness raising, but sensor technologies must be validated before sensor data are communicated to the public. In this work, the performance under field conditions of two custom-made types of ozone sensing devices, based on metal-oxide and electrochemical sensors, was tested. A large array of 132 metal-oxide (Sensortech MICS 2614) and 11 electrochemical (Alphasense) ozone sensors, built into 44 sensing devices, was co-located at reference stations in Italy (4 stations) and Spain (5). Mean R<sup>2</sup> between sensor and reference data was 0.88 (0.78-0.96) and 0.89 (0.73-0.96) for Captor (metal-oxide) and Raptor (electrochemical) nodes. The metal-oxide sensors showed an upper limit (approximately 170\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) implying that these sensors may be useful to communicate mean ozone concentrations but not peak episodes. The uncertainty of the nodes was 10% between 100 and 150\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 20% between 150 and 200\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, for Captors, and 10% for >100\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for Raptors. Operating both types of nodes up to 5\u202fmonths did not evidence any clear influence of drifts. The use of these sensors in citizen science can be a useful tool for awareness raising. However, significant data processing efforts are required to ensure high data quality, and thus machine learning strategies are advisable. Relative uncertainties should always be reported when communicating ozone concentration data from sensing nodes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.
