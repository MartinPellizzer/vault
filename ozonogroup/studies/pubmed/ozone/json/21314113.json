We have been developed a NO(X) absorption equipment with a glass fiber filter having high porosity and surface area. When feed NO(X) gas concentration was high, high NO(X) removal efficiency was obtained. This was because the surface area per glass fiber filter volume was about 40 to 600 times higher than for common packing materials. For verification test and industrial application, a high concentration of NO(X) gas (206,000 ppm) produced by a metal dissolution process was treated with a series of two absorption experiments. We can attain 97.6% of NO(X) removal efficiency, and HNO(3) concentration in water was concentrated up to 56.3 wt %. Furthermore, ozone addition to gas and usage of ozone saturated water as an absorbent resulted in complete removal of NO(X) in the gas (up to 120 ppm). This result indicated the importance of aqueous phase oxidation of HNO(2), which produces NO in the gas phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-1 Gakuen-cho, Naka-ku, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan. yasuda@chemeng.osakafu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yasuda", "ForeName": "Masahiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsugita", "ForeName": "Nobuhiro", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Katsuaki", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamauchi", "ForeName": "Shiro", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glomm", "ForeName": "Wilhelm R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuji", "ForeName": "Izumi", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asano", "ForeName": "Hideaki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "fiberglass"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21314113", "10.1021/es102214b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
