Near-UV and/or visible light is needed for photoreactivation, and the accuracy of earlier findings may have been influenced by less than maximum photorepair in the laboratory. Experiments with shrimp larvae and adult euphausiids, comparing survival at various UV-B doses and dose-rates combined with different levels of near-UV and visible irradiance, suggest that photorepair occurs in these organisms. Further, this apparent photorepair reaches maximum levels at relatively low visible light intensities.Previously reported tolerance limits for shrimp larvae and adult euphausiids were confirmed (in particular, the relationship between dose/dose-rate safe and lethal limits in shrimp). Also, the earlier experimental design did not appear to have affected these limits since additional near-UV and visible light did not substantially alter the results.In experiments using a 44-1 plastic cylinder (140-cm water depth), adult euphausiids successfully avoided moderate UV-B combined with visible light, but were attracted to and ultimately killed by higher levels of UV-B combined with low visible light. The apparent inability of euphausiids to directly detect harmful levels of UV-B irradiance would become an important factor in a new solar spectral distribution caused by ozone depletion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest and Alaska Fisheries Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2725 Montlake Boulevard East, 98112, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Oceanography, University of Washington WB-10, 98195, Seattle, WA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Damkaer", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northwest and Alaska Fisheries Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2725 Montlake Boulevard East, 98112, Seattle, WA, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dey", "ForeName": "Douglas B", "Initials": "DB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1967 Oct;58(4):1359-65", "ArticleIdList": ["5237871"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1980 Jan;44(2):149-158", "ArticleIdList": ["28310549"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1981 Mar;48(2):178-182", "ArticleIdList": ["28309796"]}, {"Citation": "Photochem Photobiol. 1981 Feb;33(2):253-6", "ArticleIdList": ["7255555"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Acad Dermatol. 1982 Aug;7(2):271-3", "ArticleIdList": ["7130487"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1974 Sep;71(9):3363-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4530308"]}, {"Citation": "Photophysiology. 1970;5:191-233", "ArticleIdList": ["4950132"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28310483", "10.1007/BF00379518", "10.1007/BF00379518"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
