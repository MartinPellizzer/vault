A total of 77 439 emergency department visits for conjunctivitis were analyzed. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied, completed with meta-analysis in order to pool inter-city results. Odds ratio (OR) for an emergency department visit was calculated in different population strata per one-unit increase (one interquartile range - IQR increase in a pollutant's daily level) while controlling for the impacts of temperature and relative humidity.", "Statistically significant positive results were observed in the female population sample, for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure lagged 5-8 days, with the highest result for the 7-day lag (OR = 1.035, 95% CI: 1.018-1.052) and for fine particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5), for lags 6 and 7 days, with the highest result for lag 7 (OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.003-1.031).
