The assays were performed in the presence of respective control groups, i.e. rats receiving the same doses of alpha-tocopherol but not exposed to ozone, a group of animals not supplemented with vitamin but exposed to ozone, a group of animals injected with physiological fluid and a control group not subjected to any of the treatments. The study revealed that the ozone-exposed animals had an increased lysozyme activity and a decreased total protein level. However, in rats protected by alpha-tocopherol and exposed to ozone, the concentration of APP, lysozyme activity and total protein were found to be decreased. Similar relationships also occurred in animals receiving alpha-tocopherol and not exposed to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Oczapowskiego 13, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland. jakar@uwm.edu.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jakubowski", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jedli\u0144ska-Krakowska", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siwicki", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pol J Vet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101125473", "ISSNLinking": "1505-1773"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acute-Phase Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Globulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Muramidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acute-Phase Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biuret Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Muramidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Nephelometry and Turbidimetry"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Globulins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15633788"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
