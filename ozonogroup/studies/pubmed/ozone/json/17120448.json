During the sequential treatment, ozonation using 0.5 or 2.5 mg/L ozone was used as a pretreatment process, whereas, during the simultaneous treatment process, ozonation of hydrocarbon-contaminated water at a predetermined duration using 0.5 mg/L ozone was made in the presence of microbial biomass. Ozonation was not beneficial for the removal of pyrene. However, despite a decreased specific biodegradation rate, ozonation improved the overall elimination of benzo(a)pyrene during both treatment processes. The overall removal of benzo(a)pyrene increased from 23 to 91% after exposure of the water to 0.5 mg/L ozone for 30 minutes during the simultaneous treatment process and further to 100% following exposure to 2.5 mg/L ozone for 60 minutes during the sequential treatment mode, demonstrating the benefits of combined ozonation-biological treatment for the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council Canada, Montreal."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yerushalmi", "ForeName": "Laleh", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nefil", "ForeName": "Sabria", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hausler", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guiot", "ForeName": "Serge R", "Initials": "SR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E0T7WFW93", "NameOfSubstance": "pyrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17120448", "10.2175/106143005x86628"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
