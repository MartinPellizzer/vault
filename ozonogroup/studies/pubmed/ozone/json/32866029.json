Dysbiosis of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota is associated with a variety of respiratory diseases. Little is known about NP flora in healthy youth, nor about its relationship with environmental factors. We characterized NP microbiota using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method, and compared microbial composition from subjects sampled in Spring and Fall when exposed to different environmental factors. Results showed that beta diversity was significantly different. Phyla <i>Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes</i>, and genus <i>Symbiobacterium</i> were positively associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Genera <i>Streptococcus, Prevotella</i>, and <i>[Prevotella]</i> were positively correlated with temperature (T). Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was associated with these floras for exposure that occurred 30\u00a0days prior to collection. These preliminary data suggest that the change in environmental factors between spring and fall can influence the composition of the NP microbiota, characterized by a significant correlation to specific taxa. These changes in NP microbiota might be a potential risk factor for respiratory disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hongcheng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shuaiyin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Huiying", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9659-7993"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Ba", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Liuxin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ruiying", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jingyuan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiota"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasopharynx"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32866029", "10.1080/09603123.2020.1810209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
