SOA was created in a 2 m3 polytetrafluoroethylene film indoor chamber under darkness. Extensive sets of SOA experiments were conducted varying humidity, inorganic seed compositions comprising of ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid, and amounts of inorganic seed mass. SOA mass was decoupled into partitioning (OM(P)) and heterogeneous aerosol production (OM(H)). The reaction rate constant for OM(H) production was subdivided into three categories (fast, medium, and slow) to consider different reactivity of organic products for the particle phase heterogeneous reactions. The influence of particle acidity on reaction rates was treated in a previous semiempirical model. Model OM(H) was developed with medium and strong acidic seed aerosols, and then extrapolated to OM(H) in weak acidic conditions, which are more relevant to atmospheric aerosols. To demonstrate the effects of preexisting glyoxal derivatives (e.g., glyoxal hydrate and dimer) on OM(H), SOA was created with a seed mixture comprising of aqueous glyoxal and inorganic species. Our results show that heterogeneous SOA formation was also influenced by preexisting reactive glyoxal derivatives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, CB# 7431, Rosenau Hall, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27599, USA. mjang@email.unc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Myoseon", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Czoschke", "ForeName": "Nadine M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Northcross", "ForeName": "Amanda L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaof", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inorganic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50NP6JJ975", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyoxal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-84-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polytetrafluoroethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glyoxal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inorganic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polytetrafluoroethylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16719105", "10.1021/es0511220"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
