In animals with ozone-induced airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and mucosal permeability increased concurrently but there was a time lag before the increase in airway vascular permeability. To study the role of tachykinins in the increases in mucosal permeability and in hyperresponsiveness, we used a neurokinin-receptor antagonist, CP-96345, and a neurokinin-2 receptor antagonist, SR-48968. CP-96345 had no significant effect, but SR-48968 reduced the increase in airway mucosal permeability; their effects on airway hyperresponsiveness were the opposite of their effects on airway permeability. Tachykinins themselves, both substance P and neurokinin A, significantly increased airway mucosal permeability. Superoxide dismutase, a scavenger enzyme of superoxide, reduced the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. These data suggest that the factors causing airway hyperresponsiveness differ from those that influence mucosal permeability, but it is possible that these pathophysiologic conditions are caused by the same substances or processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University School of Medicine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishiyama", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaneko", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishikawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamakawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okubo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Kyobu Shikkan Gakkai Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "7505737", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1542"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Neurokinin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tachykinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "720U2QK8I5", "NameOfSubstance": "SR 48968"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W22ILA2I52", "NameOfSubstance": "CP 96345"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzamides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Neurokinin-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tachykinins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9216182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
