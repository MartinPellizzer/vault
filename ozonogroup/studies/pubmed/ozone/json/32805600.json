While poultry litter is enriched with organic matter suitable for land, the presence of pathogens such as Salmonella in poultry litter is a concern. To investigate the effect of gaseous ozone on pathogen reductions in poultry litter, this study conducted a series of experiments that involved understanding of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 inactivation at various doses of Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in wet and dry poultry litter conditions. Previously, ozone treatment has been shown to disinfect the surface of foods and plant materials including fruits, juices, and wastewater, however, additional research are needed to better understand the impacts of ozone on treatment of soil amendments. Sanitizing methods capable of eliminating pathogens of soil amendments are crucial to mitigate disease outbreaks related with litter/manure-based fertilizers. In this study, a bench scale continuous ozone treatment system was designed to produce O<sub>3</sub> gas, with a range O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (7.15-132.46\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>), monitor ozone concentrations continuously, and control the ozone exposure time (15 to 90 mins) to understand the effectiveness of O<sub>3</sub> in eliminating S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 in poultry litter. Results showed that 7.15\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> did not reduce the counts of S. Typhimurium until exposure to O<sub>3</sub> for 90\u00a0min. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations of 43.26\u00a0~\u00a0132.46\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> exposure reduced the bacterial counts. Furthermore, the moisture content of poultry litter was found to be an influencing factor for pathogen reduction. The pathogen reduction rates were reduced when the moisture content was increased. At higher moisture content, high concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> (132.46\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) were needed for pathogen reductions. The moisture content of 30% or lower was found to be more effective for controlling pathogen levels in poultry litter. Our study demonstrates that gaseous O<sub>3</sub> treatment could be used as an additional decontamination technique to ensure the certain degree of microbiological safety of poultry litter based soil amendment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
