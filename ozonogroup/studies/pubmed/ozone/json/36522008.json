Therefore, the measurement of RO<sub>2</sub>, especially distinct species of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals, is important and greatly helps the exploration of atmospheric chemistry mechanisms. Although the speciated detection of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals remains challenging, various methods have been developed to study them in detail. These methods can be divided into spectroscopy and mass spectrometry technologies. The spectroscopy methods contain laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), UV-absorption spectroscopy, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and matrix isolation and electron spin resonance (MIESR). The mass spectrometry methods contain chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CI-APi-TOF), chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS), CI-Orbitrap-MS and the third-generation proton transfer reaction-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR3). This article reviews technologies for the speciated detection of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals and the applications of these methods. In addition, a comparison of these techniques and the reaction mechanisms of some key species are discussed. Finally, possible gaps are proposed that could be filled by future research into speciated RO<sub>2</sub> radicals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
