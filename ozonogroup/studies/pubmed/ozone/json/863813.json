Thirteen adult males performed both tests according to a random sequence. The maximum attained VO2 declined 10% (P less than 0.01), maximum attained work load was reduced by 10% (P less than 0.01), maximum ventilation decreased 16% (P less than 0.01), and maximum heart rate dropped 6% (P less than 0.05) in the PO test. At the highest common work load, heart rate and oxygen consumption were similar and ventilation was slightly higher (P less than 0.05); however, frequency of respiration increased 45% (P less than 0.01) and tidal voluem fell by 29% (P less than 0.01) following ozone exposure. During maximum exercise, the respiratory frequency was similar in both tests, but tidal volume was 21% lower (P less than 0.01) in PO experiments. Decreases in vital capacity and FEV1.0 as well as cough and chest discomfort were also noted following ozone exposure. We conclude that the reduction of maximum attained VO2 is a consequence of ventilatory limitation of maximum effort, probably related to respiratory discomfort."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Folinsbee", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silverman", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shepard", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["863813", "10.1152/jappl.1977.42.4.531"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
