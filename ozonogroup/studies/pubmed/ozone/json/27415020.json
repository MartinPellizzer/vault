Upon inspiration the first physical interface encountered by ozone is a thin layer of aqueous material, the epithelium lining fluid (ELF) which overlays, and is partially derived from, the underlying pulmonary epithelium. ELF is the first physical interface encountered by ozone and the majority of its primary actions are confined to this compartment. ELF contains a range of antioxidants, including the small molecular weight antioxidants: uric acid (UA), ascorbic acid (AH2) and reduced glutathione (GSH). These compounds are present in large quantities and display high intrinsic reactivities toward ozone, consistent with their role as sacrificial substrates in this setting. In this paper we examine the concept that antioxidants, in ELF, represent the first tier of defence against the oxidizing effects of ozone. Since the concentration of these antioxidants appears to differ between individuals, we propose that these protective substances may dictate, in part, an individual's sensitivity to oxidizing air pollutants such as ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Lung Biology, Cardiovascular Research , The Rayne Institute , St Thomas' Hospital , London , UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Lung Biology, Cardiovascular Research , The Rayne Institute , St Thomas' Hospital , London , UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mudway", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Redox Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9511366", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0002"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27415020", "10.1080/13510002.1997.11747110"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
