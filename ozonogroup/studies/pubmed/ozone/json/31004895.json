To estimate the risks of O<sub>3</sub> exposure to forest health, several frequently used O<sub>3</sub> exposure indices (M7, M24, N100, SUM60, W126, and AOT40f) were calculated for the entire year of 2013 and the source contributions to exposure in April and August were quantified using a source-oriented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Critical loads for natural ecosystems (12\u202fppm-h for SUM60) and for moderately sensitive plant species (23.8\u202fppm-h for W126) are exceeded in 85% and 75% of the forest areas in China, respectively. About 90% of the forest areas have AOT40f higher than the critical load of 10\u202fppm-h. Forests in the western rim of the Sichuan Basin (WSCB), parts of the southern rim of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (SQTP), Yunnan Province, and the North China Plain (NCP) have higher O<sub>3</sub> exposure than that of other areas. In spring, transport of O<sub>3</sub> and precursors from Southeast Asia have significant contributions to O<sub>3</sub> exposure for forests in Yunnan, SQTP and to a less extent in WSCB. In both spring and summer, industries and transportation sectors have large contributions to O<sub>3</sub> exposure along the WSCB and in the NCP. A higher priority in future field investigations to assess O<sub>3</sub> impacts on forests in China should be given to these regions. The results also suggest that O<sub>3</sub> production in China is much more due to nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) than due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In order to protect China's forest from O<sub>3</sub>, it would be most efficient to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from industries, transportation, and other countries in general."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
