Guinea pigs were divided into four groups: 1) a sham/saline (S/S) group: sham ozone followed by saline inhalation; 2) a sham/water (S/W) group: sham ozone followed by water inhalation; 3) an ozone/saline (O/S) group: ozone followed by saline inhalation; and 4) an ozone/water (O/W) group: ozone followed by water inhalation. After exposure to either 3.0 parts/million ozone or air at the same flow rate for 2 h, guinea pigs were anesthetized and tracheostomized, and then lung resistance (RL) was measured. For morphometric assessment, tissues were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and cut into transverse sections. Airway dimensions were either measured directly or calculated from the internal perimeter, the external perimeter, and airway wall area. There were no statistical differences in the values of RL before distilled water inhalation between the sham groups and the ozone groups. RL increased significantly after 10 min of distilled water inhalation in both the S/W group and the O/W group. In the S/W group, epithelial cells were swollen, and intercellular spaces were wider, resulting in significant increase in epithelial wall thickness, but there was no significant infiltration by inflammatory cells. In the O/S group, the epithelium showed infiltration by inflammatory cells without change in cell volume. In the O/W group, the epithelium showed both infiltration and a greater increase in epithelial wall thickness compared with the S/W group. These results suggest that airway epithelial cell swelling, induced by inhaled distilled water, increases with RL in guinea pigs and that this reaction may be accelerated by airway inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi 371, Japan. mochihi@akagi.sb.gunma-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mochizuki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arakawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokuyama", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morikawa", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10233111", "10.1152/jappl.1999.86.5.1505"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
