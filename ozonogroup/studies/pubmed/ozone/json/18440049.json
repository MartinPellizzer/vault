Anaerobic and aerobic treatments were carried out in continuous stirred tank reactors, operated separately or combined together, at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures and with or without ozone post-treatment. Anaerobic mesophilic removal of NPE consisted of complete removal of nonylphenol diethoxylate, incomplete removal of nonylphenol monoethoxylate and non stoechiometric production of nonylphenol, with consequently a NPE removal of 25%. At thermophilic temperature, anaerobic digestion led to an increase of the total solids removal efficiency, while improving NPE degradation (30%). Under thermophilic aerobic condition, the three compounds were removed simultaneously with a NPE removal efficiency higher than under anaerobic condition (39%). This removal is always well correlated to the total solids removal meaning that bioavailability remains the main limiting factor. Combination of either thermophilic aerobic-mesophilic anaerobic or mesophilic anaerobic-ozonation treatments enhanced the NPE removal by comparison to single systems (45% and 48%, respectively). These results confirm the high potential of existing and up-grading sewage sludge treatments to degrade such refractory and aged compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRA, UR050, Laboratoire de Biotechnologie de l'Environnement, Avenue des Etangs, Narbonne F-11100, France. patureau@supagro.inra.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patureau", "ForeName": "Dominique", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delgenes", "ForeName": "Nadine", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delgenes", "ForeName": "Jean-Philippe", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27986-36-3", "NameOfSubstance": "terics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79F6A2ILP5", "NameOfSubstance": "nonylphenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18440049", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.03.007", "S0045-6535(08)00334-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
