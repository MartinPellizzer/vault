Clarifying the relationship between air pollutants and upper respiratory diseases could help the patients.", "To evaluate the association between the concentration of air pollutants and the prevalence of AR and CRS among South Koreans.", "In this cross-sectional study, nationwide data were reviewed for participants of the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008 to 2012. Participants were surveyed with health questionnaires, examined with endoscopies by otolaryngologists, and tested with serum immunoglobulin E levels. The concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters \u226410\u2005\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>) were measured in 16 areas of South Korea. Air pollutant concentrations of geographic districts were matched to each participant's residence. Logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Among 27\u2005863 eligible adults, 3359 and 1606 participants had AR or CRS, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for AR, PM<sub>10</sub> showed statistically significant results (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.145, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.042-1.258). No air pollutants showed statistically significant differences in the prevalence of CRS. In AR, PM<sub>10</sub> (OR\u2009=\u20091.458, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.201-1.770) was associated with endoscopic findings of watery rhinorrhea, whereas SO<sub>2</sub> (OR\u2009=\u20091.202, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.100-1.313) was associated with pale mucosa.", "The prevalence of AR was significantly associated with PM<sub>10</sub> concentration. In patients with AR, endoscopic findings of watery rhinorrhea were associated with PM<sub>10</sub>. However, CRS was not associated with the air pollutant concentrations. Lower concentration of PM<sub>10</sub> might help managing the clinical symptoms in patients of AR."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1359-6248"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, 36899Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Munsoo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, 36899Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Soo Jeong", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, 218725Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Yujin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9799-662X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, 36899Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kijeong", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, 36899Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tae Hoon", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7698-2707"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, 36899Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang Hag", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, 36899Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Tae Hoon", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Rhinol Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "101490775", "ISSNLinking": "1945-8932"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrition Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhinorrhea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35535390", "10.1177/19458924221099373"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
