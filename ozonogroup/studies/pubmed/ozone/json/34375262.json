An improved method based on Air Quality Index (AQI) value is applied to identify polluted and clean periods. Diurnal pattern of VOC levels revealed elevated photochemical reactivity during polluted periods. Five VOC sources were identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, including secondary formation (22.71 \u00b1 12.33%), biogenic (21.50% \u00b1 11.76%), solvent usage (20.50 \u00b1 10.07%), vehicle exhaust (18.32 \u00b1 8.32%), and industrial process and fuel usage (16.96 \u00b1 13.21%). The mean contribution of vehicular exhaust was 10.84% higher during the nighttime than the daytime under polluted days. The biogenic source contributed more during clean periods, while the secondary formation presented the opposite. Spatial analysis displayed that the VOC concentration was higher in the S and SSE. In terms of the regional transport, short-distance air masses from the northeast and the south within the YRD region led to high VOC levels and biogenic VOC derived from the ocean might affect the entire region. Stringent emission control policies enforced over the YRD for 2019 CIIE provided an excellent opportunity to determine the source-receptor response. As joint control area, the VOC level of Changzhou exhibited a substantial reduction and the VOC amounts emitted by solvent usage showed the biggest decrease (-58%). The findings of this study highlight the superiority of high time-resolved data in identifying the dynamic variation pattern (with the change of time and wind) of VOC levels and emission intensities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
