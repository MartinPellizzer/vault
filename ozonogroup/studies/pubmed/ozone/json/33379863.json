Among the methods that have been introduced to reduce the Schottky barrier in 2D material-based electronic devices, charge transfer doping has attracted significant interest because of its efficiency, simplicity, and compatibility with the microelectronic fabrication process. In this study, 2D WSe<sub>2</sub>-based field-effect transistors (FETs) were subjected to selective UV/ozone treatment to improve the Ohmic contact by forming WO<sub><i>X</i></sub> with a high work function, which induced hole doping in the neighboring WSe<sub>2</sub> <i>via</i> electron transfer. The atomic force microscopy, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy analyses confirmed the self-limiting formation of WO<sub><i>X</i></sub> while maintaining the crystallinity of the underlying WSe<sub>2</sub>. The channel layer of the back-gated 2D WSe<sub>2</sub> FETs was encapsulated using 2D hexagonal boron nitride to prevent the UV/ozone-induced oxidation. By contrast, the regions that were in contact with the underlying metal electrodes were open, which allowed area-selective p-doping in the 2D WSe<sub>2</sub>. Our study demonstrated that the Ohmic-like behaviors obtained after area-selective UV/ozone treatment improved the electrical properties of the 2D WSe<sub>2</sub>-based FETs such as the field-effect mobility (improvement of 3-4 orders of magnitude) and current on/off ratio (improvement of five orders of magnitude), while maintaining the p-type normally-off characteristics. These results provide useful insights into an effective and facile method to reduce contact resistance in 2D semiconductor materials, thereby enhancing the electrical performances of 2D material-based electronic devices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Sujeong", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Geonyeop", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5634-8394"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jihyun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33379863", "10.1021/acsami.0c19712"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
