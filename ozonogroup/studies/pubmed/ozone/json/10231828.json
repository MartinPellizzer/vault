These issues are timely for consideration in the USA, where a recent periodic review of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) has led to revision of the regulatory standards for ambient ozone and particulate matter. Salient statistical issues include accounting for errors of the first and second kind due to sampling and measurement error. These issues appear routine statistically and also may seem absent from regulations, but neither is necessarily the case. This paper is directed towards developing a methodology for examining the problem of dealing with uncertainty and variation in environmental regulations and compliance criteria. Our approach is illustrated through statistical analysis of the (old) 1 hour and the (new) 8 hour standards for ambient ozone, based on intensive monitoring in California's San Joaquin Valley during summer 1990 performed under the SARMAP Project. This paper presents preliminary findings based on quantifying measurement error or precision in terms of small-scale spatial and temporal variability, laying the groundwork for future work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Environmental Protection Agency, National Exposure Research Laboratory (MD-75), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guttorp", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sampson", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caccia", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Novartis Found Symp", "NlmUniqueID": "9807767", "ISSNLinking": "1528-2511"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Interpretation, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}], "NumberOfReferences": "12"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10231828", "10.1002/9780470515600.ch7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
