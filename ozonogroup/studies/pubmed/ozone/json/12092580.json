Acute (Microtox) toxicity was decreased over treatment, from an initial EC50 of 1.83% to a value of 50.4% after 48 h of treatment. Kinetics of biodegradation were determined using respirometry and fitted using the Monod and Tessier model. For the Monod model the maximum substrate uptake rate, and Ks values determined were 0.0038 mg BOD/mgVSS min, and 1.4 mg/L, respectively. The efficacy of ozone as a pre- and post- biological treatment stage was also assessed. During ozone pretreatment, TL concentration and acute toxicity were rapidly reduced by 70% and 71%, respectively. Pre-ozonation reduced BOD and COD concentration by < 10%, however a larger fraction of residual COD was non biodegradable after ozonation. Biologically treated effluent was subjected to ozonation to determine whether further improvements in effluent quality could be achieved. A reduction in COD and TL concentration was observed during ozonation, however no further improvement in toxicity was observed. Ozonation increased BOD by 38%, due to conversion of COD to BOD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zenaitis", "ForeName": "Michael G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandhu", "ForeName": "Harinder", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duff", "ForeName": "Sheldon J B", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vibrio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12092580", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00410-9", "S0043-1354(01)00410-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
