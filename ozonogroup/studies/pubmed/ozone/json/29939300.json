We tried to determine the impact of PM2.5 and other weather factors on acute lung edema in patients with Stage 5 nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD Stage 5-ND).", "In total, 317 CKD Stage 5-ND (estimated glomerular filtration rate 6.79\u2009\u00b1\u20094.56\u2009mL/min) patients residing in central Taiwan who developed acute lung edema and initiated long-term dialysis were included in this case-crossover study. Pearson's correlation test was used to examine the relationship of acute lung edema cases with PM2.5 levels and ambient temperature separately.", "The average PM2.5 level within the 7-day period correlated with acute lung edema incidence in the fall [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.23, P\u2009=\u20090.047] and winter (adjusted OR 1.99, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In winter, even a 3-day exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increased risk (adjusted OR 1.55, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The average temperatures within 3\u2009days in spring and summer were correlated positively with the risk (adjusted OR 2.77 P\u2009<\u20090.001 and adjusted OR 2.72, P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). In the fall and winter, temperatures were correlated negatively with the risk (adjusted OR 0.36, P\u2009<\u20090.001 and adjusted OR 0.54, P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively).", "A high PM2.5 level was associated with an increased risk of acute lung edema. High ambient temperature in hot seasons and low ambient temperature in cold seasons were also associated with increased risk.
