Limited evidence is currently available regarding the association between co-exposure to PM and O<sub>3</sub> and mortality. A multicounty time-series study was used to investigate the associations of short-term exposure to PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> with daily mortality from different causes, which was based on data obtained from the Mortality Surveillance System managed by the Jiangsu Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China and analyzed via overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis. We investigated the interactions of PM and O<sub>3</sub> on daily mortality and calculated the mortality fractions attributable to PM and O<sub>3</sub>. Our results showed that PM<sub>1</sub> is more strongly associated with daily mortality than PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>, and percent increases in daily all-cause nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were 1.37% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-1.52%), 1.44% (95% CI, 1.25-1.63%), and 1.63% (95% CI, 1.25-2.01%), respectively, for a 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the 2 day average PM<sub>1</sub> concentration. We found multiplicative and additive interactions of short-term co-exposure to PM and O<sub>3</sub> on daily mortality. The risk of mortality was greatest among those with higher levels of exposure to both PM (especially PM<sub>1</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub>. Moreover, excess total and cardiovascular mortality due to PM<sub>1</sub> exposure is highest in populations with higher O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels. Our results highlight the importance of the collaborative governance of PM and O<sub>3</sub>, providing a scientific foundation for pertinent standards and regulatory interventions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jianhui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-Communicable Chronic Disease Control and Prevention Institute, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jinyi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-Communicable Chronic Disease Control and Prevention Institute, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Renqiang", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yaqi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Xinyao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ziqi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Power, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu 212100, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xueqiong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-Communicable Chronic Disease Control and Prevention Institute, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epidemiology of Major Diseases (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Shaodan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7682-4311"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Meta-Analysis", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37779243", "10.1021/acs.est.3c04056"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
