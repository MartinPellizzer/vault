The secondary endpoints of the study were the number of attempts required for successful TEE probe insertion and the relation between the esophageal inlet and the larynx. There was a higher incidence of injuries in the C group (n\u00a0=\u00a026; 14.7%) compared to the VL group (n\u00a0=\u00a014; 7.5%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.029). The number of attempts for probe insertion was significantly lower in the VL group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0023). The most common relation between the esophageal inlet and the larynx was posterolateral (n\u00a0=\u00a088; 47%), followed by posterior (n\u00a0=\u00a077; 41%) and lateral (n\u00a0=\u00a021;12%).", "The use of VL was associated with a lesser incidence of injury compared to the conventional technique, and its use for this purpose is recommended. The use of VL for probe insertion resulted in fewer attempts compared with the conventional technique. Significant variations do exist in the relation between the esophageal inlet and the larynx, and direct visualization with VL may contribute to better safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
