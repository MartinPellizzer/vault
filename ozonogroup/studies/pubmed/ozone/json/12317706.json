Germany, France, Italy, and others want to increase their fertility fearing that the aging of their populations (due to increased longevity) will produce an unprecedentedly large proportion of people in retired and unproductive status. The consumption of developed nations lead to substantial environmental degradation, especially with regard to the environmental threats of ozone-layer depletion and global warming. Britain has almost 58 million people and a population growth rate of .2%/year producing an extra 116,000 people/year through natural increase along. Bangladesh with 120 million people and a population growth rate of 2.4%/year adds an extra 2.9 million people/year. However, an average Briton consumes the energy equivalent of 35 barrels of oil/year and an average Bangladeshi only 3 barrels. The environmental impact, through affluence and technology, of each of the US 250 million people is twice that of a citizen in Britain or Australia, 50 times that of a citizen of India or China, and almost 300 times that of a person in Uganda or Laos. The fossil fuel (oil equivalent) consumption of an American amounts to 8000 liters and that of an Indian just over 400 liters or only 5% as much, which holds implications for the greenhouse effect and for global climate systems."]}], "OtherID": ["075450", "00215502"], "PMID": "12317706", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "05", "Day": "05"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0968-1655", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992"}}, "Title": "People & the planet", "ISOAbbreviation": "People Planet"}, "ArticleTitle": "A population policy for the North?", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "31", "MedlinePgn": "31"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myers", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "People Planet", "NlmUniqueID": "9433816", "ISSNLinking": "0968-1655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12317706"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
