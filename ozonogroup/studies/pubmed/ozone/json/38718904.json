This article explores ozonation as a green method for lignin extraction from lignocellulosic biomass, aiming to uncover the benefits of the extracted lignin. A pilot-scale ozonation reactor was employed to extract lignin from Miscanthus giganteus (a grass variety) and vine shoots (a woody biomass). The study examined the lignin extraction and modification of the fractions and identified the generation of phenolic and organic acids. About 48\u00a0% of lignin was successfully extracted from both biomass types. Phenolic monomers were produced, vine shoots yielding fewer monomers than Miscanthus giganteus. Ozonation generated homogeneous lignin oligomers, although their molecular weight decreased during ozonation, with vine shoot oligomers exhibiting greater resistance to ozone. Extracted fractions were stable at 200\u00a0\u00b0C, despite the low molecular weight, outlining the potential of these phenolic fractions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
