Photochemical reactions of many emitted chemical compounds can generate important (secondary) pollutants including ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and some particulate matter, known to be detrimental to human health and ecosystems. Poor air quality is the major environmental cause of premature deaths globally, and even a small decrease in air quality can translate into a large increase in the number of deaths. In many regions of the globe, changes in emissions of pollutants have caused significant changes in air quality. Short-term variability in the weather as well as long-term climatic trends can affect ground-level pollution through several mechanisms. These include large-scale changes in the transport of O<sub>3</sub> from the stratosphere to the troposphere, winds, clouds, and patterns of precipitation. Long-term trends in UV radiation, particularly related to the depletion and recovery of stratospheric ozone, are also expected to result in changes in air quality as well as the self-cleaning capacity of the global atmosphere. The increased use of substitutes for ozone-depleting substances, in response to the Montreal Protocol, does not currently pose a significant risk to the environment. This includes both the direct emissions of substitutes during use and their atmospheric degradation products (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, TFA)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Atmospheric Chemistry, School of Earth, Atmosphere and Life Sciences, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia. swilson@uow.edu.au."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4546-2527"], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0983-1313"], "LastName": "Madronich", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute for Global Risk Research, LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA and Emergent BioSolutions, Gaithersburg, MD, USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7923-6726"], "LastName": "Longstreth", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Toxicology and School of Environmental Sciences, University of Guelph, ON, Canada."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8496-6413"], "LastName": "Solomon", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101124451", "ISSNLinking": "1474-905X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stratospheric Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecological Parameter Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone Depletion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Stratospheric Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30810564", "10.1039/c8pp90064g"]}}]}
