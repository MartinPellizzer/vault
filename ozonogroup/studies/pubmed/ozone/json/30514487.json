In the present work, sonocatalytic degradation (catalysts as CuO and TiO<sub>2</sub>) of phosphonate based industrial wastewater, procured from a local company, has been studied in terms of COD reduction under optimized conditions (established using initial studies involving only ultrasound) of pH as 3.2, the temperature of 32\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C and 120\u202fmin as treatment time. The combination of ultrasound with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ozone in different approaches has been investigated for maximizing the COD reduction. The optimum set of operating conditions for the sonocatalytic degradation were established as power dissipation of 90\u202fW and catalyst loading as 0.75\u202fg/L for CuO and 0.5\u202fg/L for TiO<sub>2</sub>. Use of only ultrasound resulted in COD reduction of 37.2% whereas the combination of US with different approaches resulted in higher extents of COD reduction. The combined operation of US\u202f+\u202fH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>, US\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u202f+\u202fCuO, and US\u202f+\u202fO<sub>3</sub>\u202f+\u202fH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>\u202f+\u202fTiO<sub>2</sub> resulted in the extent of COD reduction as 91.5%, 93.8%, and 95.8% respectively. Overall, it has been clearly established that maximum COD reduction is obtained for the combined operation of sonocatalysis (catalyst as TiO<sub>2</sub>) with ozone and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
