Linear mixed-effects models and Spearman's correlation coefficients were then used to elucidate the relationships among size-segregated particulate matter (PM) levels, their particle components, and gaseous co-pollutants. Seasonal and spatial differences in the concentrations of all measured species were evaluated at all sites on the basis of P values for product terms. Outdoor quasi-ultrafine (UF) and, to a lesser extent, accumulation-mode particles were the two fractions that best correlated with outdoor concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx; during both phases of the study), and ozone (O3; only during the warmer months). Outdoor and indoor concentrations of CO, NO2, and NOx were more positively correlated to personal quasi-UF particles than larger size fractions. Despite these findings, it seems unlikely that these gaseous co-pollutants could confound epidemiologic associations between quasi-UF particles and adverse health effects. Overall, measured gaseous co-pollutants were weak surrogates of personal exposure to accumulation-mode PM, at least for subjects with similar exposure profiles and living in similar urban locations. Indoor sources were not significant contributors to personal exposure of accumulation and quasi-UF PM, which is predominantly influenced by primary emitted pollutants of outdoor origin. Correlations between personal coarse-mode PM and both outdoor and indoor gaseous co-pollutant concentrations were weak at all sites and during all seasons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Southern California, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arhami", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Polidori", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delfino", "ForeName": "Ralph J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tjoa", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sioutas", "ForeName": "Constantinos", "Initials": "C"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES12243", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Los Angeles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residential Facilities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19418813", "10.3155/1047-3289.59.4.392"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
