There is little information available about degradation of sodium alginate by ozonation. Effect of ozonation on molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, color change, M/G ratio, and chemical structure of sodium alginate was investigated. The molecular weight of sodium alginate decreased from 972.3 to 76.7 kDa in the 80-min period of ozonation at 25 \u00b0C. Two different degradation-rate constants were calculated. Molecular weight distribution of the LMWSA changed appreciably. Ozonation cannot lead to color change of LMWSA. The M/G ratio of LMWSA was not altered significantly, compared with that of the original alginate. The FT-IR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra indicated the chemical structure of LMWSA obtained by ozonation was not altered appreciably. New insight into the ozonation of alginate will be promisingly opened up. Ozonation of sodium alginate can be a alternative for production of LMWSA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
