To understand the effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on apple (Malus) and to explore its defense mechanisms, we exposed 'Hongjiu' crabapple to O<sub>3</sub> and monitored its responses using physiological, transcriptomics, and metabolomics analyses. Exposure to 300\u00a0nL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> for 3\u00a0h caused obvious damage to the leaves of Malus crabapple, affected chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents, and activated antioxidant enzymes. The gene encoding phospholipase A was highly responsive to O<sub>3</sub> in Malus crabapple. McWRKY75 is a key transcription factor in the response to O<sub>3</sub> stress, and its transcript levels were positively correlated with those of flavonoid-related structural genes (McC4H, McDFR, and McANR). The ethylene response factors McERF019 and McERF109-like were also up-regulated by O<sub>3</sub>. Exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) decreased the damaging effects of O<sub>3</sub> on crabapple and was most effective at 200\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L <sup>-1</sup>. Treatments with MeJA altered the metabolic pathways of crabapple under O<sub>3</sub> stress. In particular, MeJA activated the flavonoid metabolic pathway in Malus, which improved its resistance to O<sub>3</sub> stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
