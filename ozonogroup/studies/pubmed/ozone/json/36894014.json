Inhalation of aerosols generated from NTM-containing water and soil causes NTM lung disease, especially in people with underlying lung diseases and decreased immunity. To prevent healthcare-acquired NTM infections, it is important to eradicate NTM living in hospital environments. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of gaseous ozone for the inactivation of NTM, namely Mycobacterium (M.) avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and M.abscessus subsp. massiliense. Gaseous ozone treatment at 1\u00a0ppm for 3\u00a0h reduced the bacterial number of all strains by more than 97%. Gaseous ozone treatment could be a practical, effective and convenient disinfection method for NTM living in hospital environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and Japanese Society for Infection Prevention and Control.
