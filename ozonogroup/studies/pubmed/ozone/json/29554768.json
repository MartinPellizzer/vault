Smoke-haze episodes caused by the vegetation and peat fires in Indonesia severely affected large parts of Malaysia during the 2015 El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. This study aimed to evaluate the factors that influenced the concentrations of aerosol and trace gases during the 2015 haze and non-haze period on a semi-urban site in the southern part of Malaysian peninsula that facing Sumatra (Muar, Site A), and on an urban site near to Kuala Lumpur, influenced by the city centre (Cheras, Site B). Local land use data and the cluster of air mass weighted backward trajectory were used to identify the potential factors from local sources and the transboundary region, respectively. The annual median concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> for semi-urban and urban sites were 45.0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 47.0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively for the study period (Jan-Dec 2015) from the hourly observation dataset. The highest PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations during the haze were 358\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 415\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for the two sites, respectively, representing absolutely unhealthy air. However, the trace gases were within the safe threshold. The average concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> and carbon monoxide were two fold higher during the haze than the non-haze episodes on both sites. Nitrogen dioxide was more influenced by haze compared with sulphur dioxide and ozone. The results of the land use change suggest that the local factor can also partially affect the air pollution on the urban area (Site B) but more visible in 2015. The results of the backward trajectory and the wildfire radiative power showed that the smoke-haze episodes that affected Malaysia in 2015 were mainly initiated in the Indonesian Sumatra and Kalimantan regions. This study provides a very useful information towards the impacted region during El Ni\u00f1o haze episode."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
