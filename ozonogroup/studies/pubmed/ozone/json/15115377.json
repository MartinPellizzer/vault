The analyses evaluated the effect of exclusion/inclusion of cloud cover as a variable. It was found that a simple model, using the current maximum ground-level O3 concentration and no effect of cloud cover provided a reasonable prediction of the vertical profile of O3, based on data analyzed from O3 sites located in North Carolina and Tennessee. The simple model provided an approach that estimates the concentration of O3 as a function of elevation (up to 1800 m) based on the statistical results with a +/- 13.5 ppb prediction error, an R2 of 0.56, and an index of agreement, d1, of 0.66. The inclusion of cloud cover resulted in a slight improvement in the model over the simple regression model. The developed models, which consist of two matrices of 24 equations (one for each hour of day for clear to partly cloudy conditions and one for cloudy conditions), can be used to estimate the vertical O3 profile based on the inputs of the current day's 1-hr maximum ground-level O3 concentration and the level of cloud cover."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Gi-Dong", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davis", "ForeName": "Wayne T", "Initials": "WT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Terry L", "Initials": "TL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15115377", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470914"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
