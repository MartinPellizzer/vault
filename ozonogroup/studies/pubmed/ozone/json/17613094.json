Surface-inoculated tomatoes were immersed/sprayed with chlorinated (200 mg l(-1)) and ozonated water (1 and 2 mg l(-1)) under 2 and 100 nefelometric turbidity units (NTU). Contact times were 120 and 30 s for immersing and spraying applications, respectively. Immersing in chlorinated water and low turbidity resulted in the most effective application with 3.61 log(10) bacterial reduction, while 1 and 2 mg l(-1) of ozone reduced 2.32 and 2.53 log(10), respectively. High turbidity and chlorine reduced the bacterial counts by 3.39 log(10), while 1 and 2 mg l(-1) of ozonated water and low turbidity reduced the bacteria by 1.48 and 1.92 log(10), respectively. Spraying chlorinated water reduced bacteria by 3 log(10), and ozonated water at 1 and 2 mg l(-1) reduced counts by 1.84 and 2.40 log(10), respectively. No statistical differences were found between chlorine and ozone (2 mg l(-1)) during spraying applications (p < 0.05). The use of ozonated water both in immersing and spraying applications is suggested when water turbidity remains low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigacion en Alimentacion y Desarrollo, Sinaloa, Mexico. chaqui@ciad.edu.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaidez", "ForeName": "Cristobal", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lopez", "ForeName": "Javier", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vidales", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campo", "ForeName": "Nohelia Castro-Del", "Initials": "NC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17613094", "10.1080/09603120701417063", "780014398"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
