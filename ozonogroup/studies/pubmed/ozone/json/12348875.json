With only 1.7 million of a possible 8-15 million species identified, it will take decades to identify even half of the species (assuming the number does not exceed 10 million). This great number of species provides a multitude of essential environmental services to humanity, such as creating soil, controlling water supplies, controlling pests, dispersing pollutants, and stabilizing the weather and climate. Initial estimates of the economic value of these services range from $2.9 to $33 trillion (as compared to the world's gross economic product of $29 trillion). Recognition of economic value can translate into protection, as evidenced by payments for \"bioprospecting\" being conducted by US pharmaceutical firms and the way that revenues from ecotourism far exceed other activities (a single pod of 16 whales in Japan would produce $41 million from whale watchers over 15 years as compared to the $4.3 million they represent to hunters). Despite these findings, humans continue to contribute to a mass extinction on par with the extinction of the dinosaurs. What actions are taken in the next few decades will determine the future of the biosphere for the next 5 million years. Even if immediate action is taken, it will take decades before the hole in the ozone layer is fixed, eroded topsoil is replaced, and the climate is stabilized. The strategy of creating protected areas is no longer enough, and action must be taken to protect the remaining biodiversity."]}], "OtherID": ["139584", "00282713"], "PMID": "12348875", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1999", "Month": "04", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0968-1655", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "7", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1998"}}, "Title": "People & the planet", "ISOAbbreviation": "People Planet"}, "ArticleTitle": "Overview: Securing the fabric of life.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "6", "EndPage": "9", "MedlinePgn": "6-9"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myers", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "People Planet", "NlmUniqueID": "9433816", "ISSNLinking": "0968-1655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12348875"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
