The methylation levels in whole blood at six years of age were measured, and the methylation clocks, including Horvath's clock, Horvath's skin and blood clock, PedBE, and Wu's clock, were estimated. Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to analyze the association between EAA and air pollutants.", "A total of 76 children in EDC cohort were enrolled in this study. During the whole pregnancy, interquartile range (IQR) increases in exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (4.56\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and CO (0.156\u202fppm) were associated with 0.406 years and 0.799 years of EAA (Horvath's clock), respectively. An IQR increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (4.76\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) for one year before the child was six years of age was associated with 0.509 years of EAA (Horvath's clock) and 0.289 years of EAA (Wu's clock). PM<sub>10</sub> (4.30\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and O<sub>3</sub> (0.003\u202fppm) exposure in the period were also associated with EAA in Horvath's clock (0.280 years) and EAA in Horvath's skin and blood clock (0.163 years), respectively.", "We found that prenatal and childhood exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with EAA among children. The results suggest that air pollution could induce excess biological aging even in prenatal and early life."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
