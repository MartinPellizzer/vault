All used agrochemicals showed partial protective effects against ozone injury on clover and tobacco. Conducted studies confirmed the effectiveness of modern fungicides belonging to strobilurin group as protectants of sensitive crops against ozone damage. The effectiveness of new growth regulators \"Emistym C\" and \"Agrostymulin\" was showed for the first time. Out of the studied agrochemicals, fungicide \"Strobi\" and natural growth regulator \"Emistym C\" demonstrated the best protective effects. These agrochemicals present promise for further studies of their possible utilization for enhancement of ozone tolerance of sensitive crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.
