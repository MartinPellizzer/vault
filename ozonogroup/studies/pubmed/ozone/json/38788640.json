Carboxyl groups were found to be introduced into the modified konjac glucomannan while acetyl groups were removed. The backbone, branched chains, and crystal structure of modified konjac glucomannan were not significantly affected. The whiteness was enhanced to 97-99\u00a0% and the thermal degradation temperature was up to 250\u00a0\u00b0C after modification. The solubility of the modified konjac glucomannan (oxidized for 60\u00a0min) was significantly increased to 84.56\u00a0% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while its viscosity and swelling power were notably decreased owing to the changes in molecular weight (from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>) and functional groups. Rheological analysis showed that oxidized deacetylated konjac glucomannan has the ability to form soft-textured gels and the potential to develop dysphagia foods. Future studies should focus on the gelation mechanisms of oxidized deacetylated konjac glucomannan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
