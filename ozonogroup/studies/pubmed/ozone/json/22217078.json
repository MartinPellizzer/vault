Among various available methods, biodegradation seems to be generally the most cost-effective method for decreasing concentrations of NAs (n \u2264 21) and reducing their associated toxicity in OSPW, however the mechanism by which the biodegradation of NAs occurs are poorly understood. Ozonation is superior over biodegradation in decreasing higher molecular weight alkyl branched NAs (preferentially, n \u2265 22, -6 \u2265 z \u2265 -12) as well as enabling accelerated biodegradation and reducing toxicity. Photolysis (UV at 254 nm) is effective in cleaving higher molecular weight NAs into smaller fragments that will be easier for microorganisms to degrade, whereas photocatalysis can metabolize selective NAs (0 \u2265 z \u2265 -6) efficiently and minimize their associated toxicity. Phytoremediation is applicable for metabolizing specific NAs (O(2), O(3), O(4), and O(5) species) and minimizing their associated toxicities. Petroleum coke (PC) adsorption is effective in reducing the more structurally complex NAs (preferentially 12 \u2265 n \u2265 18 and z = -10, -12) and their toxicity in OSPWs, depending upon the PC content, pH and temperature. Several factors have influence on the degradation of NAs in OSPWs and aquatic environments, which include molecular mass and chemical structure of NAs, sediment structure, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and bacteria types."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kannel", "ForeName": "Prakash R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Thian Y", "Initials": "TY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YNM5U6B7A4", "NameOfSubstance": "naphthenic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Extraction and Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22217078", "10.1080/10934529.2012.629574"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
