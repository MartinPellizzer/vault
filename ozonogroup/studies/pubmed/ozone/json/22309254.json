Only patients with ischaemic stroke living within the study area, composed of Lyon and 18 neighbouring communities with homogenous air pollutants exposure, formed the basis of our study. We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyse the short-term effect (up to two-days) of air pollutants on ischaemic stroke incidence. Models were adjusted for temperature, variation of atmospheric pressure, minimal relative humidity, influenza epidemics, pollen count, and holidays. Stratified analyses by gender and class age were performed. Different lag times were analysed.", "376 patients were included. Mean age was 76\u00b76 years (\u00b1 13\u00b77). 53\u00b77% were women. No association was observed between air pollutants and short-term risk of ischaemic stroke after adjustment for main confounding factors. Results remained unchanged whatever the gender or age.", "These results suggest a lack of association between air pollutant exposure and short-term risk of ischaemic stroke in a French urban area."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 The Authors.
