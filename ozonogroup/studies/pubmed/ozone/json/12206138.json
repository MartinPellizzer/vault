Among these mediators, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are both involved in bactericidal killing and trigger the release of other cellular metabolites. We have analyzed the effect of an atmosphere polluted with ozone (0.03-0.5 ppm v/v) on the monocytic cell line THP-1, as a model for alveolar macrophages, in vitro. NO and H2O2 were chosen to evaluate cell response to ozone. Cell injury was evaluated using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) liberation into the medium. An exposure to 0.5 ppm ozone proved to be more toxic to the cells, than 0.1 or 0.03 ppm, evidenced by more LDH being liberated and cytotoxicity reaching values up to 64%. For all ozone concentrations, H2O2 production reached a peak value after 10-15 min of exposure, after which the concentration of extracellular H2O2 production diminished rapidly. The highest NO concentrations were measured with 0.5 ppm ozone, reaching a maximum value of 1460 nmol/L per 5 x 10(6) cells, which is 1.55 times higher than for nonexposed cells. Lower concentrations barely induced higher NO concentrations compared to nonexposed cells. The results indicate that ozone effects not only the viability of human monocytes but also the release of antibacterial and defense signaling molecules and suggest that ozone-mediated cytotoxicity may be related to the secretion of NO and H2O2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Metz, D\u00e9partement G\u00e9nie Biologique - G\u00e9nie de l' Environnement, Yutz, France. dklestad@iut.univ-metz.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klestadt", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laval-Gilly", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Falla", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Cell Biol Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8506639", "ISSNLinking": "0742-2091"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12206138", "10.1023/a:1016055011920"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
