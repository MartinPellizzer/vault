In this study, the CO tracer method was used to estimate the secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration in the winter of 2017-2021. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics were analyzed, and the influencing factors of regional secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> were discussed. The results showed that the decreasing trend of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region in the winter of 2017-2021 was obvious, and the cities with the largest decline were located in the central and southern part of Hebei Province, mainly contributed by primary PM<sub>2.5</sub>. There was a good correlation between secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in all cities of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, and the proportion of secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing and Tianjin was significantly higher than that in other cities. With the aggravation of pollution degree, the mass concentration of primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> and secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased in varying degrees, and the proportion of secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased significantly. Compared with the direct measurement results, the estimated value obtained by this method was lower as a whole. The selection of appropriate primary aerosol reference value was the key to improving this method and estimating the secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ying-Xiao", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Wen-Yan", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zi-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Environmental Meteorology Center, Tianjin 300074, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CMA-NKU Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, Tianjin 300074, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Su-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37177917", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205221"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
