The effect of various parameters including pH, initial concentration of dyes, applied ozone dose and the influence of the substituent groups of the dye were investigated. Ozonation was found effective for decolorization of all types of dyes studied. The total ozone consumption for decolorization varied from dye to dye depending upon their chemical structure. Ozonation reduced COD of the dye solution to a small extent, which was affected by the number of azo groups in the dye. The pH had a mixed effect on decolorization efficiency as some dyes showed high decolorization efficiency with increasing pH and decolorization of some dyes was independent of pH. Substituent groups attached to the dye structure affected decolorization efficiency in the ozonation process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Textiles, UMIST, Manchester, United Kingdom. mhassan@yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "M Mahbubul", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hawkyard", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12369646", "10.1081/ese-120013277"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
