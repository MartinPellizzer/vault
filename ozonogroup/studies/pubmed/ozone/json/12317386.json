Currently human activities are approaching an upset of environmental balance through production of greenhouse gases, depletion of the ozone layer, and reduction of natural resources. Equity is the right to a decent life for the current human population of 5.5 billion and the future 10 billion expected within the next 50 years. A minimum use of environmental space/person is required. The Earth Summit will be a broad statement of environmental policy. Agenda 21 includes 115 action programs within 40 chapters. Separate conventions will be held on climate and biodiversity. The secretariat of UNCED has been working primarily with Agenda 21. Population issues are emphasized in Chapter 5 (\"Demographic Dynamics and Sustainability\") of the first section in Agenda 21 on Social and Economic Dimensions. The program areas include 1) research on the links between population, the environment, and development; 2) formulation by governments of integrated national policies on environment and development, which account for demographic trends, and promotion of population literacy; and 3) implementation of local level programs to ensure access to education and information and services in order to plan families freely and responsibly. Increases in funding for the population program are anticipated to be US $9 billion by the year 2000 and about US $7 billion/year until then. The year 2000 will bring with it a doubling of urban population in developing countries. There are challenges and opportunities to expand private sector job creation, education, clean water, and family health services. In addition to managing human settlements, there is also management of fragile ecosystems, which means relieving the pressure on these lands through urban migration or relocation to richer agricultural areas. The goal for agriculture is to triple food outputs over the next 50 years without increasing land use; improved soil and management systems are needed. Ocean/seas protection from pollution and provision of an adequate, clean water supply are other challenges. Demographic transition must be completed in order to improve global development success."]}], "OtherID": ["073128", "00218795"], "PMID": "12317386", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "09", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0968-1655", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "1-2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992"}}, "Title": "People & the planet", "ISOAbbreviation": "People Planet"}, "ArticleTitle": "People, poverty and the Earth Summit.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "8", "EndPage": "10", "MedlinePgn": "8-10"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "People Planet", "NlmUniqueID": "9433816", "ISSNLinking": "0968-1655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Planning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Agencies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organization and Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poverty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Planning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Welfare"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Nations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12317386"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
