Fortunately, a new concept of the cataluminescence (CTL) sensor provides a scheme of real-time ozone sensing in a tiny system. Here, a novel CTL sensor system was specially developed with silica-hydroxyl functional boron nitride as the sensing material for rapid and sensitive ozone detection. Coupled with the construction of a pulse vacuum static sampling system, ozone on the surface of sensing material can be desorbed rapidly and can step into the next detection circulation in a few seconds. Based on the strong emission initiated by the transient of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including singlet oxygen, a trioxide group, and an oxygen radical, the detection limit of ozone could be optimized to be as low as 51.2 ppb. Besides, the sensor system exhibited remarkable anti-interference performance in which humidity changes and common VOCs do not disturb or weakly disturb ozone sensing, and the CTL mechanism of the multistep degradation process was further discussed on the basis of multiple pieces of experimental evidence and a DFT transient calculation. A real-time degradation-sensing module was further attached to the system to realize the functions of ozone decomposition and real-time monitoring."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry &amp; Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Chudong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry &amp; Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Shuguang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical &amp; Testing Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jiaxi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5124-4564"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical &amp; Testing Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Mingxia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4441-2176"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry &amp; Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lichun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7104-2414"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry &amp; Technology, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical &amp; Testing Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu610064, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boron Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smart Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2U4T60A6YD", "NameOfSubstance": "boron nitride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Boron Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Luminescent Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smart Materials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36200973", "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03728"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
