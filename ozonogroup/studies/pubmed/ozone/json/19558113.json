When it's initial content was 2 mg/L and O3 dosage was 7.5 mg/L, Atrazine was removed about 27.2% after 5 minutes. Under the same condition, H2O2/O3 molar ratio was 0.75, Atrazine maximum removal rate reached 96.5%, which suggested that Atrazine could be degraded by O3/H2O2 system effectively. Ion Chromatography (IC) analysis showed that concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions were increasing along with the Atrazine content decreasing. Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry chromatograms (LC-MS) analyzing illuminated the existence of de-ethyl-atrazine, de-isopropyl-atrazine and de-chloro-atrazine, which indicated the Atrazine could not be destroyed completely by O3/H2O2 system. Consequently, it should be combined with GAC (Granular Activated Carbon) or other techniques while used as primary treatment unit or emergency measure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen Polytechnic Institute, Shenzhen 518055, China. solve28@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-Feng", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rong-Quan", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJA9M5H4IM", "NameOfSubstance": "Atrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Atrazine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19558113"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
