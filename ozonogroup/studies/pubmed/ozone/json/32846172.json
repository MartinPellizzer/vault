In a time-stratified case-crossover study, we analyzed single day and/or cumulative average days (up to a 6 day lag) of exposure to fine (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and coarse particles (PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) for mothers estimated to reside within 10\u00a0km of a pollution monitor based on reported zip code. We also examined potential confounding by apparent temperature or co-pollutants, and effect modification by maternal demographic factors, fetal sex, gestational age, and cause of stillbirth.", "Stillbirth cases in the primary analyses ranged between 1,203 and 13,018, depending on the pollutant. For an IQR increase in SO<sub>2</sub> (lag 4), O<sub>3</sub> (lag 4), and PM<sub>10-2.5</sub> (lag 2), we found a 2.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2%, 5.5%), 5.8% (95% CI 1.6%, 10.1%), and 6.1% (95% CI 0.1%, 12.4%) increase in the odds of stillbirth, respectively. Additional adjustment by apparent temperature had little effect on the SO<sub>2</sub> association but slightly attenuated O<sub>3</sub> (adjusted % change: 4.2% (95% CI -0.2%, 8.9%) and PM<sub>10-2.5</sub> (5.7% (95% CI -1.1%, 13.0%)) associations, while other co-pollutants had minimal impact.
