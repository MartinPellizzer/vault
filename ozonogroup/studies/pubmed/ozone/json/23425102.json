Measurements were made using a common sampling manifold to which controlled concentrations of Hg species, including gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and HgBr2 (a surrogate gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) compound), and potential interferents were added. We present an analysis of Hg measurements made using the University of Washington's Detector for Oxidized Hg Species (DOHGS), focusing on tests of GEM and HgBr2 spike recovery, the potential for interference from ozone (O3) and water vapor (WV), and temporal variability of ambient reactive mercury (RM). The mean GEM and HgBr2 spike recoveries measured with the DOHGS were 95% and 66%, respectively. The DOHGS responded linearly to HgBr2. We found no evidence that elevated O3 interfered in the DOHGS RM measurements. A reduction in RM collection and retention efficiencies at very high ambient WV mixing ratios is possible. Comparisons between the DOHGS and participating Hg instruments demonstrate good agreement for GEM and large discrepancies for RM. The results suggest that existing GOM measurements are biased low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science and Technology Program, University of Washington-Bothell, Bothell, Washington 98011, United States. jlambros@u.washington.edu"}], "LastName": "Ambrose", "ForeName": "Jesse L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lyman", "ForeName": "Seth N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jiaoyan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gustin", "ForeName": "Mae S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jaffe", "ForeName": "Daniel A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P986675T8V", "NameOfSubstance": "mercuric bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nevada"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23425102", "10.1021/es303916v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
