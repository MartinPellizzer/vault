To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of crystal-face-selective adsorption on an inorganic solid surface. Hydrogen-plasma-treated BDD samples and those followed by UV/ozone treatment for 2 min or longer showed almost no adsorption of AuNP after immersion in the AuNP solution prepared by the citrate reduction method. However, the samples treated by UV/ozone for 10 s showed AuNP adsorption on their (111) facets selectively after the immersion. Moreover, the sample treated with UV/ozone for 40-60 s showed AuNP adsorption on the whole surface. These results indicate that the AuNP adsorption behavior can be controlled by UV/ozone treatment time. This phenomenon was highly reproducible and was applied to a two-step adsorption method, where AuNPs from different batches were adsorbed on the (111) and (100) surface in this order. Our findings may be of great value for the fabrication of advanced nanoparticle-based functional materials via bottom-up approaches with simple macroscale procedures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science 1-3 Kagurazaka, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8601, Japan. t.kondo@ci.kagu.tus.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aoshima", "ForeName": "Shinsuke", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirata", "ForeName": "Kousuke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Honda", "ForeName": "Kensuke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Einaga", "ForeName": "Yasuaki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujishima", "ForeName": "Akira", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawai", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7782-40-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Diamond"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diamond"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18547082", "10.1021/la800782r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
