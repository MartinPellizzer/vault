We conducted a quasi-experimental study to evaluate inflammatory response to changes in air quality during the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics in China. We repeatedly measured 8 biomarkers of systemic inflammation in 31 healthy adults and obtained hourly air pollutant concentrations from a nearby fixed-site monitoring station. We used linear mixed-effect models to examine the associations between air quality changes and blood biomarkers. Air pollutant concentrations decreased apparently during the Youth Olympics. Concomitantly, we observed significant decreases in levels of soluble cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) ligand and interleukin 1\u03b2 (geometric means ratios\u00a0were\u00a00.45 and 0.24, respectively) from the pre-Olympic period to the intra-Olympic period. Afterwards, levels of C-reactive protein and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 increased significantly (geometric means ratios\u00a0were\u00a02.22 and 1.29, respectively) in the post-Olympic period. Fine particulate matter and ozone were significantly associated with soluble CD40 ligand, P-selectin, interleukin 1\u03b2, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. Other pollutants showed positive but nonsignificant associations. Our study indicated that reduced air pollution, especially fine particulate matter and ozone, during the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics was associated with alleviated systemic inflammation in healthy adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author 2017.
