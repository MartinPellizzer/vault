While literature focused on air pollution episodes in Southeast Asia, we have yet to fully understand the contributions of local emission sectors and TAP to air quality in the region annually. Herein we employed air quality modeling with the species tagging method to first assess the contributions of source sectors and locations to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in Southeast Asia and to hence quantify the resultant health impacts. Our results show that air pollutant exposure was associated with\u00a0\u223c\u00a0900 thousand premature mortalities in Southeast Asia every year. Of which, 77\u00a0% and 23\u00a0% were due to local emissions and TAP in the region, respectively.\u00a0\u223c\u00a087\u00a0% of the premature mortalities due to local emissions were induced by PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, whereas the remaining were due to O<sub>3</sub> exposure. PM<sub>2.5</sub>-related health impacts were dominated by industrial (45\u00a0%) and residential (17\u00a0%) emissions, and O<sub>3</sub>-related impacts were mainly due to biogenic (40\u00a0%) and road transport (24\u00a0%) emissions. Furthermore, the health impacts of TAP were particularly adverse in Brunei, East Timor, Singapore, Laos, and border regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
