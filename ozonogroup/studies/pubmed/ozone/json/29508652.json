In vitro approaches using lung cell cultures grown at the air-liquid interface and directly exposed to ambient air can offer a reliable addition to animal experimentations and epidemiological studies. To evaluate the adverse effects of ambient air in summer and winter a multi-cellular lung model (16HBE14o-, macrophages, and dendritic cells) was exposed in a mobile cell exposure system. Cells were exposed on up to three consecutive days each 12\u2009h to ambient air from Fribourg, Switzerland, during summer and winter seasons. Higher particle number, particulate matter mass, and nitrogen oxide levels were observed in winter ambient air compared to summer. Good cell viability was seen in cells exposed to summer air and short-term winter air, but cells exposed three days to winter air were compromised. Exposure of summer ambient air revealed no significant upregulation of oxidative stress or pro-inflammatory genes. On the opposite, the winter ambient air exposure led to an increased oxidative stress after two exposure days, and an increase in three assessed pro-inflammatory genes already after 12\u2009h of exposure. We found that even with a short exposure time of 12\u2009h adverse effects in vitro were observed only during exposure to winter but not summer ambient air. With this work we have demonstrated that our simple, fast, and cost-effective approach can be used to assess (adverse) effects of ambient air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg , Fribourg , Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Bisig", "ForeName": "Christoph", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg , Fribourg , Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry , University of Fribourg , Fribourg , Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Petri-Fink", "ForeName": "Alke", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg , Fribourg , Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Rothen-Rutishauser", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "HMOX1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NQO1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29508652", "10.1080/08958378.2018.1441926"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
