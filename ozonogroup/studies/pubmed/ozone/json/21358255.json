One session of 3-4 L/min 100% oxygenation for 60 min at 3 absolute atmosphere (ATA) was defined as one dose of HBO; in total, 7 doses of HBO-PC were administered before ischemia. One dose of O3 comprised 0.7 mg/kg ozone/oxygen mixture, administered intraperitoneally; a total of 4 doses of O3-PC were administered before ischemia. The I/R model was performed in anesthetized rats by clipping right femoral artery to induce 2 h ischemia followed by 22 h of reperfusion. The right gastrocnemius muscle and venous blood samples were harvested. Tissue was assayed for levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Serum was assayed to measure the level of nitrite-nitrate (NOx).", "Tissue MDA level, SOD activity, and serum NOx level were increased, whereas GSHPx was decreased in the I/R group. MDA and NOx levels were decreased, whereas GSH-Px activity was increased in both the I/R+HBO-PC and I/R+O3-PC groups. SOD activity was increased in the I/R+O3-PC group, but did not change significantly in the I/R+HBO-PC group. iNOS staining score and intensity were lower in the I/R+HBO-PC and I/R+O3-PC groups than I/R group.", "Both O3-PC and HBO-PC reduced tissue lipid peroxidation, NOx levels, and iNOS staining scores in the experimental I/R model. Our data suggest that HBO-PC and O3-PC protect against oxidative/nitrosative stress induced by I/R in rat skeletal muscle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GATA, Department of Orthopedics, Ankara, Turkey. drkenankoca@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koca", "ForeName": "Kenan", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yurtta\u015f", "ForeName": "Y\u00fcksel", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "ForeName": "Cemil", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cayc\u0131", "ForeName": "Tuncer", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uysal", "ForeName": "B\u00fclent", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korkmaz", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Acta Orthop Traumatol Turc", "NlmUniqueID": "9424806", "ISSNLinking": "1017-995X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hyperbaric Oxygenation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemic Preconditioning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tourniquets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21358255", "10.3944/AOTT.2010.2327"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
