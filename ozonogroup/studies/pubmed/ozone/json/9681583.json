The comparison of cases found that: (i) the mean age at first presentation to the clinic was significantly younger for primary CRSD compared to secondary CRSD; (ii) more secondary CRSD cases were unemployed than were Primary CRSD cases; (iii) more cases in the secondary CRSD group had a clear trigger for sleep-wake rhythm disorder onset than cases in the primary CRSD group; and (iv) the types of sleep-wake rhythm disorders in the primary CRSD group consisted of delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), 72 (83.7%), non-24 pattern, 11 (12.8%), and irregular, 3 (3.5%). In the secondary CRSD group there were 25 (62.5%) cases of DSPS pattern, 1 (2.5%) of non-24 pattern and 14 (35.0%) with irregular pattern. The 56 (65.1%) cases with primary CRSD showed good response to vitamin B12 and bright light therapy; however, 28 (70.0%) cases with secondary CRSD did not respond to such therapies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamadera", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ushijima", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Psychiatry Clin Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "9513551", "ISSNLinking": "1323-1316"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "P6YC3EG204", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin B 12"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age of Onset"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Wake Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin B 12"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9681583", "10.1046/j.1440-1819.1998.00395.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
