However, to our knowledge, most previous studies on PM/BS process were limited in synthetic water at lab-scale. Hence, the performance of TrOCs abatement by PM/BS process was investigated in real waters in this study, and for the first time, its feasibility as a pretreatment process was evaluated at pilot-scale. The lab-scale results indicated that almost all tested TrOCs could be completely removed from pure water, while their removal efficiencies varied widely from \u223c20 % to \u223c90 % in real waters. Correlation analysis suggested that TrOCs abatement decreased linearly with increasing concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and halide ions in real waters. The TrOCs with electron-donating groups were more likely to be decomposed in PM/BS process. The PM/BS pretreatment produced MnO<sub>2</sub> and decreased the aromatic signal of the DOM, which enhanced the removal of DOM during subsequent coagulation-sedimentation processes. Comparing with ozonation, chlorination, and permanganate processes, PM/BS process showed some advantages in terms of TrOCs abatement and operating costs. Furthermore, the pilot-scale experiment confirmed that PM/BS process combined with traditional water treatment processes could achieve excellent TrOCs abatement (greater than 84%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
