Herein, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV/PDS were employed to remove the bulk recalcitrant organics in the RO concentrate with a focus on the process efficiency and kinetic modeling. Results show that UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> overmatched UV/PDS in reducing the COD and DOC of the wastewater and the advantage became more evident in aspects of biodegradability improvement and energy cost. Specifically, the COD and DOC were removed by 62.0% and 55.5% with UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (6\u00a0mM) while the BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD was elevated to 0.54\u00a0at a specific energy consumption of 0.83\u00a0kWh g<sup>-1</sup> (lab-scale). The UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process also exhibited a good adaptability to the fluctuation of wastewater quality. Afterwards, the reaction rate constants of the bulk organics upon UV photolysis and HO<sup>\u2022</sup> oxidation were calculated based on pseudo-first-order kinetics and radical steady-state approximation of DOC removal in the bench-scale UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reactor. A computational fluid dynamics model was then developed for the analysis of distributions of flow, radiation and chemicals in flow-through reactors which facilitated the practical process efficiency assessment. This work demonstrates the applicability of UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in removing recalcitrant organics in the RO concentrate and presents an approach from bench-scale experiments to flow-through system evaluation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
