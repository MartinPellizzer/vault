After chromatography separation, the arsenic species were passed through HEPO which performed efficient photooxidation and converted MMA and DMA to As(V) in several seconds. Then the reaction of ozone and arsine upon hydride generation produced a CL signal as the analytical parameter. The total analytical process was completed within 10 min. The effects of operational parameters such as the concentrations of hydrochloric acid and NaBH4 solution, carrier gas flow and air gas flow for ozone generation were investigated. Detection limits were 3.7, 10.3, 10.2 and 10.0 microg/L for As(III), As(V), MMA and DMA, respectively. The recoveries of the four arsenic species in human urine sample ranged from 87 to 94%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Key Laboratory for Atomic and Molecular Nanosciences of Education Ministry, Tsinghua University, 100084 Beijing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Junhai", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhenli", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Sichun", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xinrong", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Luminescence", "NlmUniqueID": "100889025", "ISSNLinking": "1522-7235"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Borohydrides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "87L0B9CPPA", "NameOfSubstance": "sodium borohydride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QTT17582CB", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrochloric Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Borohydrides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrochloric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19367660", "10.1002/bio.1099"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
