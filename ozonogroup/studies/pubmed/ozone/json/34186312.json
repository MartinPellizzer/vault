Application of biochar and/or nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has the potential to reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions; however, it is not clear how biochar application may affect the efficacy of NI in reducing nitrification rates, soil enzyme activities, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions under different soil moisture regimes. We conducted a 60-day laboratory incubation experiment to study the effects of manure biochar and nitrapyrin (as a NI) on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from a urea fertilized soil with either 60 (low) or 80% (high) water-filled pore space (WFPS). Nitrification rates were significantly affected by biochar\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0NI\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0WFPS and biochar\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0WFPS interactions. Biochar initially increased and then decreased the rates, resulting in 45.2 and 26.6% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for both) overall reductions in low and high WFPS, respectively while NI reduced the rates only in the first 10 days at 60% WFPS. Biochar decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and NI increased (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) \u03b2-1,4-N-acetyl glucosaminidase activities while urease activities were increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) by biochar across WFPS. Biochar had significant interaction with NI in cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions with the efficacy of NI being reduced when co-applied with biochar. Cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were greater at high than at low WFPS; the emissions were decreased by biochar at 60% WFPS and NI at both 60 and 80% WFPS. We conclude that biochar reduces efficacy of nitrapyrin in mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions and their effects on net nitrification rates, enzyme activities and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions are dependent on soil moisture level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
