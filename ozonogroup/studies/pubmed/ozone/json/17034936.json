The leachate was characterised by high COD, low biodegradability and intense dark colour. A purpose-built reactor, to avoid foaming, was used for the study. It was found that ozone efficacy was almost doubled when combined with hydrogen peroxide at 2g/L but higher H(2)O(2) concentrations gave lower performances. Enhancement in the leachate biodegradability from about 0.1 to about 0.7 was achieved by the O(3)/H(2)O(2) system. Insignificant changes in pH that may due to buffering effect of bicarbonate was found. A small decrease in sulphate concentrations were also observed. In contrast, chloride concentration declined at the beginning of the experiment then increased to reach its initial value. Estimates of the operating costs were made for comparison purposes and it was found that the O(3)/H(2)O(2) system at 2g/L H(2)O(2) gave the lowest cost of about 3.1TND( approximately 2.3USD)/kgCOD removed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Design and Technology, University of Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, UK. c.tizaoui@bradford.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tizaoui", "ForeName": "Chedly", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouselmi", "ForeName": "Latifa", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Loubna", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghrabi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costs and Cost Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17034936", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.09.023", "S0304-3894(06)01065-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
