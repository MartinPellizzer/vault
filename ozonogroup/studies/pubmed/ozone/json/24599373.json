Nitrogen fixation potential (acetylene reduction) by cyanobacteria associated with the moss Sanionia uncinata in vegetation exposed to experimentally enhanced levels of UV-B for 3 and 4\u00a0years in the high arctic in Adventdalen was reduced by 50% compared to controls after 3\u00a0years. No reduction in nitrogen fixation potential was observed in cyanobacteria associated with the moss Hylocomium splendens when previously exposed to enhanced UV-B in Abisko for a 7-year period. However, in the same experiment a 50% increase in summer precipitation stimulated nitrogen fixation potential by up to 6-fold above the natural precipitation treatments both in cyanobacteria associated with vegetation exposed to natural and enhanced UV-B radiation. In contrast to the lack of UV effect on moss-associated nitrogen fixation at the subarctic site, nitrogen fixation potential by the dominant lichen species Peltigera aphthosa was reduced by 50% when measured after 8\u00a0years exposure to elevated UV-B treatment. Evidence from these studies highlights the importance of UV-B radiation for cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation in the Arctic and future impact on nitrogen availability in such plant communities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Troms\u00f8, 9037, Troms\u00f8, Norway, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solheim", "ForeName": "Bj\u00f8rn", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Box 117, 221 00, Lund, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johanson", "ForeName": "Ulf", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sheffield Centre for Arctic Ecology, Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, The University of Sheffield, 26 Taptonville Road, Sheffield, S10 5BR, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Abisko Naturvetenskapliga Station, Abisko, 981 07, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Callaghan", "ForeName": "Terry V", "Initials": "TV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TN, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "John A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3DA, Wales, Australia.
