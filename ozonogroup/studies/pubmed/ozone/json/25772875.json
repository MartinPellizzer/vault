Flux-based critical levels for O3 through stomata have been adopted for some northern hemisphere species, showing better accuracy than with accumulated ozone exposure above a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40). In Brazil, critical levels for vegetation protection against O3 adverse effects do not exist. The study aimed to investigate the applicability of O3 deposition model (Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange (DO3SE)) to an O3-sensitive tropical tree species (Psidium guajava L. 'Paluma') under the MRSP environmental conditions, which are very unstable, and to assess the performance of O3 flux and AOT40 in relation to O3-induced leaf injuries. Stomatal conductance (g s) parameterization for 'Paluma' was carried out and used to calculate different rate thresholds (from 0 to 5 nmol O3 m(-2) projected leaf area (PLA) s(-1)) for the phytotoxic ozone dose (POD). The model performance was assessed through the relationship between the measured and modeled g sto. Leaf injuries were analyzed and associated with POD and AOT40. The model performance was satisfactory and significant (R (2)\u2009= 0.56; P < 0.0001; root-mean-square error (RMSE)\u2009= 116). As already expected, high AOT40 values did not result in high POD values. Although high POD values do not always account for more injuries, POD0 showed better performance than did AOT40 and other different rate thresholds for POD. Further investigation is necessary to improve our model and also to check if there is a critical level of ozone in which leaf injuries arise. The conclusion is that the DO3SE model for 'Paluma' is applicable in the MRSP as well as in temperate regions and may contribute to future directives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Bot\u00e2nica, Caixa Postal 3005, S\u00e3o Paulo, 01061-970, Brazil, pedroivolembo@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Assis", "ForeName": "Pedro I L S", "Initials": "PI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alonso", "ForeName": "Roc\u00edo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meirelles", "ForeName": "S\u00e9rgio T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moraes", "ForeName": "Regina M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Psidium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25772875", "10.1007/s11356-015-4293-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
