Thermophilic aerobic biological treatment, pH adjustment, flocculation, and ozonation were tested as pretreatment methods on pilot or on laboratory scale. The aim was to increase flux and reduce fouling by various pretreatment steps and, thus, increase the competitiveness of the membrane process. The results were also evaluated by comparing the benefits obtained against the costs. It was discovered that benefits could be obtained with all the pretreatments tried. Thermophilic aerobic biology assisted in the removal of organic material and increased flux significantly, but the costs were the highest. The most cost-effective processes, however, seem to be pH-adjusted nanofiltration and flocculation nanofiltration hybrid processes, which is understandable because of their significantly lower investment costs compared to, for example, those of biological process. The pH adjustment increased the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged solutes and membrane, thereby increasing the flux. Flocculation removed the foulants effectively from the feed and it both increased flux and reduced fouling. Yet, many noteworthy benefits were obtained also with ultrafiltration and ozonation. All of the hybrid processes tested could be applied at various points of the water circuit of an integrated pulp and paper mill for purification purposes. The eventual superiority and cost-effectiveness of the applied process remains to be determined case by case."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Membrane Technology and Technical Polymer Chemistry, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland. jnj@lut.fi"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nuortila-Jokinen", "ForeName": "Jutta", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huuhilo", "ForeName": "Tiina", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nystr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "Marianne", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann N Y Acad Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7506858", "ISSNLinking": "0077-8923"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12783809", "10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb05991.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
