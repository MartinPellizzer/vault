Eskisehir is one of the developing cities of Turkey where a total of approximately 750tons/day of waste is generated. An effective MSW management system is needed in this city since the generated MSW is dumped in an unregulated dumping site that has no liner, no biogas capture, etc. Therefore, five different scenarios were developed as alternatives to the current waste management system. Collection and transportation of waste, a material recovery facility (MRF), recycling, composting, incineration and landfilling processes were considered in these scenarios. SimaPro7 libraries were used to obtain background data for the life cycle inventory. One ton of municipal solid waste of Eskisehir was selected as the functional unit. The alternative scenarios were compared through the CML 2000 method and these comparisons were carried out from the abiotic depletion, global warming, human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical ozone depletion points of view. According to the comparisons and sensitivity analysis, composting scenario, S3, is the more environmentally preferable alternative. In this study waste management alternatives were investigated only on an environmental point of view. For that reason, it might be supported with other decision-making tools that consider the economic and social effects of solid waste management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anadolu University, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Environmental Engineering, Iki Eylul Campus, 26555 Eskisehir, Turkey. mbanar@anadolu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banar", "ForeName": "Mufide", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cokaygil", "ForeName": "Zerrin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozkan", "ForeName": "Aysun", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag", "NlmUniqueID": "9884362", "ISSNLinking": "0956-053X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18280731", "10.1016/j.wasman.2007.12.006", "S0956-053X(08)00007-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
