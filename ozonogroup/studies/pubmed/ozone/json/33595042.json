In this study, methylamine (MA) and ethylamine (EA), as well as their secondary and tertiary amines (DMA, DEA, TMA and TEA) were chosen as aliphatic amine models and their degradation mechanisms during ozonation were investigated by using the DFT method. The oxygen-transfer reaction occurs initially and rapidly in the ozonation of all the above amines with a \u0394G<sup>\u2260</sup> value of 8-10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> in great agreement with the experimental rate constant of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, N-oxide as the main degradation product for tertiary amines directly forms after oxygen-transfer, while nitroalkanes as main products for secondary and primary amines are yielded after a series of reactions mediated by hydroxylamine and nitrosoalkane with a \u0394G<sup>\u2260</sup> value of 10-13 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. Regarding the minor N-dealkylated products for all amines, alkylamino alcohol is an important intermediate possibly generated via a radical reaction pathway with a \u0394G<sup>\u2260</sup> value of 21-34 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, comparison of the reactivity of aliphatic amines, hydroxylamines and alkylamino alcohols with ozone was made and elucidated in this study. The results are expected to expand our understanding of the degradation mechanisms for nitrogenous compounds during ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental and Viral Oncology, College of Life Science & Bioengineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China. ydliu@bjut.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Qunfang", "Initials": "Q", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong Dong", "Initials": "YD", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Rugang", "Initials": "R", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "55"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33595042", "10.1039/d0em00476f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
