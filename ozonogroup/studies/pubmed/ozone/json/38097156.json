Although date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is a globally important crop in arid or semi-arid regions, so far O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment for this species has not been reported. This study estimated leaf- and plant-level photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for understanding how elevated levels of O<sub>3</sub> affects date palm biomass growth. Ozone risks to date palm plants were assessed based on exposure- (AOT40) or flux-based indices (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose, POD<sub>y</sub>, where y is a threshold of uptake). For this purpose, plants were exposed to three levels of O<sub>3</sub> [ambient air, AA (45\u00a0ppb as daily average); 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA; 2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0AA] for 92 days in an O<sub>3</sub> Free-Air Controlled Exposure facility. According to the model simulations, the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on plant-level net photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake were attributed to reduced gross photosynthetic carbon gain and increased respiratory carbon loss. Season-long O<sub>3</sub> exposure and elevated temperatures promoted the negative O<sub>3</sub> effect because of a further increase of respiratory carbon loss, which was caused by increased leaf temperature due to stomatal closure. POD<sub>1</sub> nonlinearly affected the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, which was closely related to the variation of dry mass increment during the experiment. Although the dose-response relationship suggested that a low O<sub>3</sub> dose (POD<sub>1</sub>\u00a0<\u00a05.2\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>) may even positively affect photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in date palms, stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake at the current ambient O<sub>3</sub> levels has potentially a negative impact on date palm growth. The results indicate 5.8\u00a0mmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> POD<sub>1</sub> or 21.1\u00a0ppm\u00a0h AOT40 as critical levels corresponding to a 4% reduction of net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for date palm, suggesting that this species can be identified as a species moderately sensitive to O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
