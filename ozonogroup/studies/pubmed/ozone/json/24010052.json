High-resolution air quality information can offer significant health benefits by leading to improved environmental decisions. A practical challenge facing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is to provide real-time forecasting of current 8-hour average ozone exposure over the entire conterminous United States. Such <i>real-time</i> forecasting is now provided as spatial forecast maps of <i>current</i> 8-hour average ozone defined as the average of the previous four hours, current hour, and <i>predictions</i> for the next three hours. Current 8-hour average patterns are updated hourly throughout the day on the EPA-AIRNow web site. The contribution here is to show how we can substantially improve upon current real-time forecasting systems. To enable such forecasting, we introduce a downscaler fusion model based on first differences of real-time monitoring data and numerical model output. The model has a flexible coefficient structure and uses an efficient computational strategy to fit model parameters. Our hybrid computational strategy blends continuous background updated model fitting with real-time predictions. Model validation analyses show that we are achieving very accurate and precise ozone forecasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, Box 90251, Durham NC 27708-0251, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paci", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gelfand", "ForeName": "Alan E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holland", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES014843", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Spat Stat", "NlmUniqueID": "101612400"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Sahu SK, Yip S, Holland DM.
