The present study analyses the in situ observations of surface O<sub>3</sub> and NOx for January-December 2016, for the first time over three sites of North-Eastern India (Aizwal, Gauhati and Tezpur). The sites are major cities of north-eastern India, located in the foothills of Eastern Himalaya and have no industrial impacts. We have analysed the seasonal variation of O<sub>3</sub> and NOx and found that the site Tezpur, which is in the valley area of Eastern Himalaya, is experiencing higher values of pollutants persisting for a long time compared to the other two stations. The correlation of surface O<sub>3</sub> with the air temperature at all three sites suggested that all the O<sub>3</sub> may not be locally produced, but has the contribution of transported pollution reaching to stations. The study also attempts to discover the existing variability in the surface O<sub>3</sub> and NOx over the study area by employing continuous wavelet analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
