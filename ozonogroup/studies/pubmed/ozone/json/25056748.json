Ozonation, catalytic ozonation and adsorption experiments were conducted using both synthetic HA solution and natural water. HA degradation was evaluated in terms of DOC, VIS400 and UV254. It was shown that the addition of catalyst positively affects the mechanism of ozonation. An increase in HA degradation was observed for all these parameters. The impact of catalyst dose and initial pH value of HA on the efficacy of catalytic ozonation was investigated. The highest removal efficiencies were achieved with the dose of 1\u00a0g\u00a0l(-1) of TiO2 (Degussa P-25) and in the acidic pH region. The catalytic ozonation process was efficient also on natural water component although not at the same level as it was on synthetic water. The adsorptive feature of P-25 was considered to have a clear evidence of the catalytic ozonation mechanism. The mechanism of catalysis on the surface of metal oxides was elucidated with the help of quantum-chemical calculations. In the framework of Density Function Theory (DFT), the O3 decomposition was calculated in the catalytic and non-catalytic processes. Donor-acceptor properties of the frontier (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, HOMO/LUMO) orbitals are discussed. Electron density distribution and reaction mechanism of superoxide particles formation, which participate in the process of HA ozonation are analyzed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Gebze Institute of Technology, 41400, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey, oturkay@gyte.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Turkay", "ForeName": "Ozge", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Inan", "ForeName": "Hatice", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dimoglo", "ForeName": "Anatoli", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2009 Sep 30;169(1-3):411-8", "ArticleIdList": ["19395159"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2003 Apr;37(7):1443-67", "ArticleIdList": ["12600374"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2011 Aug;84(8):1009-31", "ArticleIdList": ["21621242"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2012 May 15;425:169-75", "ArticleIdList": ["22483747"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2013 Jun;20(6):3890-9", "ArticleIdList": ["23184131"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci (China). 2010;22(10):1527-33", "ArticleIdList": ["21235181"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2008 Mar;15(2):128-35", "ArticleIdList": ["18380231"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Technol. 2005 Sep;26(9):1033-41", "ArticleIdList": ["16196411"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2002 Jul;48(4):453-60", "ArticleIdList": ["12152748"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2008 Mar;42(6-7):1563-70", "ArticleIdList": ["18048076"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25056748", "10.1007/s11356-014-3326-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
