Additionally, evidence on people who are potentially sensitive to air pollution-associated stroke mortality is limited.", "Daily stroke mortality of adults aged over 65 between 2003 and 2008 in Shanghai, China were collected. The time-stratified case-crossover approach was used to assess the association between daily concentrations of air pollutants including particles with size <10 \u00b5m, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and stroke mortality.", "Both total-stroke and ischaemic-stroke mortalities were found to be significantly associated with all three air pollutants. Haemorrhagic stroke was significantly associated with SO2 and NO2 only. Substantial differences were observed for effect estimates of ischaemic-stroke mortality in relation to NO2 among people with cardiac diseases compared with those without; for an increase of 10 \u03bcg/m(3) in NO2, the increase in ischaemic-stroke mortality was 7.05% (95% CI 1.92% to 12.17%) for people with comorbid cardiac diseases versus 0.60% (95% CI -0.49% to 1.68%) for those without. We did not find evidence of effect modification by hypertension and diabetes.", "This study provides new evidence for the association between exposure to ambient air pollution and stroke mortality. Our results also suggest that underlying cardiac disorder may increase the risk for ischaemic-stroke mortality in relation to air pollution exposure, especially NO2. ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Yifeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Meiying", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Binxin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kan", "ForeName": "Haidong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Guixiang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Wenzheng", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunfang", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Epidemiol Community Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7909766", "ISSNLinking": "0143-005X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23661720", "10.1136/jech-2012-201096", "jech-2012-201096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
