The etiology of the disease is unknown but may involve exposure to an antigenic agent and subsequent inflammatory response resulting in granuloma formation. Various environmental and occupational risk factors have been suggested by previous observations, such as moldy environments, insecticides, and bird breeding. Our study investigated the association of air pollution with diagnosis of sarcoidosis using a case-control design. Penn State Health electronic medical records from 2005 to 2018 were examined for adult patients with (cases) and without (controls) an International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 or -10 code for sarcoidosis. Patient addresses were geocoded and 24-hr residential-level air pollution concentrations were estimated using spatio-temporal models of particulate matter\u2009<2.5\u2009\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> elemental carbon (EC) and moving averages calculated. In total, 877 cases and 34,510 controls were identified. Logistic regression analysis did not identify significant associations between sarcoidosis incidence and air pollution exposure estimates. However, the odds ratio (OR) for EC for exposures occurring 7-10\u2009years prior did approach statistical significance, and ORs exhibited an increasing trend for longer averaging periods. Data suggested a latency period of more than 6\u2009years for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and EC for reasons that are unclear. Overall, results for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and EC suggest that long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution may contribute to the development of sarcoidosis and emphasize the need for additional research and, if the present findings are substantiated, for public health interventions addressing air quality as well as increasing disease surveillance in areas with a large burden of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and EC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Yanosky", "ForeName": "Jeff D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}], "LastName": "Washington", "ForeName": "Abigail", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Penn State Milton S.
