Here, we evaluate the secondary organic compounds formed through heterogeneous reactions of gaseous O<sub>3</sub> with hand skin lipids by using a high-resolution quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a commercial secondary electrospray ionization (SESI) source. More than 600 ions were detected over a period of less than 40 min real-time measurements, among which 53 ions were characterized with a significant increasing trend in signal intensity at the presence of O<sub>3</sub>. Based on the detected ions, we suggest detailed reaction pathways initiated by ozone oxidation of squalene that results in primary and secondary ozonides; we noticed for the first time that these products may be further cleaved by direct reaction of nucleophilic ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), emitted from human skin. Finally, we estimate the fate of secondarily formed carbonyl compounds with respect to their gas-phase reactions with \u00b7OH, O<sub>3</sub>, and NO<sub>3</sub> and compared with their removal by air exchange rate (AER) with outdoors. The obtained results suggest that human presence is a source of an important number of organic compounds, which can significantly influence the air quality in indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9425-0371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometry and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for On-line Source Apportionment System of Air Pollution, Guangzhou, 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Jiafa", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7241-1827"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 10069, China."}], "LastName": "Mekic", "ForeName": "Majda", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometry and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for On-line Source Apportionment System of Air Pollution, Guangzhou, 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Loisel", "ForeName": "Gwendal", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometry and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for On-line Source Apportionment System of Air Pollution, Guangzhou, 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4151-2224"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China."}], "LastName": "Gligorovski", "ForeName": "Sasho", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9247-0584"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Mass Spectrometry and Atmospheric Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for On-line Source Apportionment System of Air Pollution, Guangzhou, 510632, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong-Hongkong-Macau Joint Laboratory of Collaborative Innovation for Environmental Quality, Guangzhou 511443, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7QWM220FJH", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Squalene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33085459", "10.1021/acs.est.0c05100"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
