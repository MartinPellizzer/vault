Each group received 15 sets of physiotherapy at a rate of five sets every week (study group (n= 139), control group (n= 159)). Six OT injections were applied solely to the study group, two days per week. A visual pain score (VAS) was set up for distress and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI) for disablement was administered when the groups were called to control before treatment, towards the end of the treatment, and three months after the treatment ended.", "The groups had significantly reduced (p< 0.05) VAS and ODI scores following and three months after the treatment contrasted with their scores before the treatment. The Physiotherapy + OT group had significantly lower (p< 0.05) VAS and ODI scores than the physiotherapy group following and three months after the treatment.", "Paravertebral OT injection is quite a safe and helpful treatment technique in LDH patients. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the long-term outcomes of the paravertebral OT application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yal\u00e7\u0131n", "ForeName": "\u00dcmit", "Initials": "\u00dc"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Back Musculoskelet Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "9201340", "ISSNLinking": "1053-8127"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disability Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lumbar Vertebrae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33523038", "10.3233/BMR-200129", "BMR200129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
