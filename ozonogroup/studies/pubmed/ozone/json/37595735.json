However, it is unclear whether it can promote secondary aerosol formation under dry conditions. To investigate this issue, two years of comprehensive observations was conducted at a semi-arid site, near the dust source regions. Three types of episodes were selected: dust, anthropogenic-dominated, and mixed (mixed with dust and anthropogenic aerosols). Compared to anthropogenic-dominated episodes under humid conditions, rapid nitrate formation was still observed in mixed episodes under dry conditions, suggesting that active metallic oxides in dust, such as titanium dioxide, could promote photochemical reactions of nitrogen dioxide. The detailed evolutionary processes are further illustrated by a typical dust-to-mixed episode. After the arrival of the dust, titanium sharply increased ten-fold and rapid nitrate formation was observed, together with a rapid increase in the two most important photochemical pollutants, ozone and peroxyacetyl nitrate. The increased secondary organic carbon further illustrated that the suspended dust particles accelerated the atmospheric oxidative capacity, thereby enhancing secondary aerosol formation and eventually leading to haze pollution. These results differ from those in humid regions and therefore expand the scientific understanding of the impact of dust aerosols on haze pollution under dry conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
