This work investigates the ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), ultraviolet (UV)/O<sub>3</sub>, UV/O<sub>3</sub>/persulfate (PS) processes for the treatment of marine oily wastewater, including degradation performance, acute toxicity evaluation, and oil flocs analysis in a benchtop circulating flow photoozonation reactor. Degradation performances have been studied by measuring the degradation rate of total oil concentrations, specific oil components (n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and total organic carbon (TOC). The results show that UV/O<sub>3</sub>/PS could significantly enhance the removal efficiency than the other two processes, with above 90% of removal efficiency in 30\u00a0min. Acute toxicity analysis further shows that the wastewater quality is significantly improved by four-fold of the EC<sub>50</sub> of Vibrio fischeri, and the mortality of Artemia franciscana decreases from 100% to 0% after 48\u00a0h exposure. Further, the morphology and functional groups of flocs have been further characterized, showing that the floating flocs could be further degraded especially in UV/O<sub>3</sub>/PS process. Our study further raised discussions regarding the future on-site application of O<sub>3</sub>-based systems, based on the results generated from the treatment efficiency, toxicity, and flocs characterization. The regulation of the oxidation strength and optimization of the reaction systems could be a practical strategy for on-site marine oily wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2022.
