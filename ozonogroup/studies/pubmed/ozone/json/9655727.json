We studied 18 boilermakers overhauling a large, oil-fired boiler and 11 utility workers who served as controls for 6 wk. NL was performed before (NL1), during (NL2), and after (NL3) the overhaul. We measured nasal fluid levels of interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 8 (IL-8), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as markers of response to fuel-oil ash exposure. In boilermakers, MPO was elevated during boiler work versus preboiler work (mean = 33.8 versus 22.7 ng/ml, p < 0.05), and at the 2-wk postexposure lavage (NL3) it had declined to 24.2 ng/ml (p = 0.08). Mean IL-8 levels increased in boilermakers between NL1 and NL2 (mean = 83.8 versus 134.8 pg/ml, p < 0.05), then decreased at NL3 (mean = 134.8 versus 89.0 pg/ml, p < 0.05). Nasal fluid vanadium increased in boilermakers between NL1 and NL2 (median < 1.0 versus 4.7 ppb, respectively, p < 0.05), then decreased at NL3 (median, 4.7 versus < 1.0 ppb, respectively, p < 0. 05). Levels of IL-6 and ECP did not change significantly during the study. Utility workers showed no significant change in any marker during the study period. Particulate matter < 10 micro(m) (PM10) levels were higher for boilermakers than for utility workers before boiler work (geometric mean (GM) = 0.40 versus 0.10 mg/m3, p < 0.05). This difference was more significant during boiler work (GM = 0.47 versus 0.13 mg/m3, p < 0.001). Ozone levels were low during the study. These data suggest that exposure to fuel-oil ash results in acute upper airway inflammation, potentially mediated by increased IL-8 levels and the recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These changes were associated with significantly increased PM10 levels and concentrations of upper airway vanadium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Department of Environmental Health (Occupational Health Program), Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodin", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hauser", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siegel", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewis", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tollerud", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christiani", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-00002", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-05947", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES-07069", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Eosinophil Granule Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fuel Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanadium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribonucleases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophil Granule Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fuel Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vanadium Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9655727", "10.1164/ajrccm.158.1.9711054"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
