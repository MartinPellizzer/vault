Hence, the techniques that can capture and recover the used halocarbons with energy efficiency methods have recently received greater attention. In this contribution, we report the capture of dichlorodifluoromethane (R12), which has high global warming and ozone depletion potential, using covalent organic polymers (COPs). The defect-engineered COPs were synthesized and demonstrated outstanding sorption capacities, ~226 wt% of R12 combined with linear-shaped adsorption isotherms. We further identified the plausible microscopic adsorption mechanism of the investigated COPs via grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations applied to non-defective and a collection of atomistic models of the defective COPs. The modeling work suggests that significant R12 adsorption is attributed to a gradual increment of porosities due to isolated/interconnected micro-/meso-pore channels and the change of the long-range ordering of both COPs. The successive hierarchical-pore-filling mechanism promotes R12 molecular adsorption via moderate van der Waals adsorbate-adsorbent interactions in the micropores of both COPs at low pressure followed by adsorbate-adsorbate interactions in the extra-voids created at moderate to high pressure ranges. This continuous pore-filling mechanism makes defective COPs as promising sorbents for halocarbon adsorption."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Wiley\u2010VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Energy and Environment Directorate, UNITED STATES."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Montpellier, ICGM, 34293, FRANCE."}], "LastName": "Wahiduzzaman", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Energy and Environment Directorate, UNITED STATES."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Energy and Environment Directorate, UNITED STATES."}], "LastName": "Barpaga", "ForeName": "Dushyant", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Energy and Environment Directorate, UNITED STATES."}], "LastName": "McGrail", "ForeName": "B Peter", "Initials": "BP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, UNITED STATES."}], "LastName": "Thallapally", "ForeName": "Praveen", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universite de Montpellier, Institut Charles Gerhardt Montpellier, 1919 route de Mende, 34293, Montpellier, FRANCE."}], "LastName": "Maurin", "ForeName": "Guillaume", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Energy and Environment Directorate, UNITED STATES."}], "LastName": "Motkuri", "ForeName": "Radha Kishan", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Chemphyschem", "NlmUniqueID": "100954211", "ISSNLinking": "1439-4235"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38634178", "10.1002/cphc.202400283"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
