The phase-in of unsaturated halocarbons for various applications, such as refrigeration and foam blowing, can be tracked by their emergence and increase in the atmosphere. We present the first atmospheric measurements of the hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) HFO-1336mzz(<i>Z</i>) ((<i>Z</i>)-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene, <i>cis</i>-CF<sub>3</sub>CH\u2550CHCF<sub>3</sub>), a newly used unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon. HFO-1336mzz(<i>Z</i>) has been detected in >90% of all measurements since 2018 during multi-month campaigns at three Swiss and one Dutch location. Since 2019, it is found in \u223c30% of all measurements that run continuously at the Swiss high-altitude Jungfraujoch station. During pollution events, mole fractions of up to \u223c10 ppt were observed. Based on our measurements, Swiss and Dutch emissions were estimated at 2-7 Mg yr<sup>-1</sup> (2019-2021) and 30 Mg yr<sup>-1</sup> (2022), respectively. Modeled spatial emission distributions only partly conform to population density in both countries. Monitoring the presence of new unsaturated halocarbons in the atmosphere is crucial since long-term effects of their degradation products are still debated. Furthermore, the production of HFOs involves climate-active substances, which may leak to the atmosphere\u2500in the case of HFO-1336mzz(<i>Z</i>), for example, the ozone-depleting CFC-113a (CF<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0003-0860-1548"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, \u00dcberlandstrasse 129, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 3, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Rust", "ForeName": "Dominique", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, \u00dcberlandstrasse 129, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Vollmer", "ForeName": "Martin K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, \u00dcberlandstrasse 129, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Henne", "ForeName": "Stephan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Gas Analysis, METAS, Federal Institute of Metrology, Lindenweg 50, 3003 Bern-Wabern, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "B\u00fchlmann", "ForeName": "Tobias", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Modelling, Sensing & Analysis, TNO, Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, Westerduinweg 3, 1755LE Petten, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Frumau", "ForeName": "Arnoud", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Modelling, Sensing & Analysis, TNO, Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, Westerduinweg 3, 1755LE Petten, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "van den Bulk", "ForeName": "Pim", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9812-3986"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, \u00dcberlandstrasse 129, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Emmenegger", "ForeName": "Lukas", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5211-4358"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 3, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Zenobi", "ForeName": "Renato", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, \u00dcberlandstrasse 129, 8600 D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Reimann", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37506302", "10.1021/acs.est.3c01826"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
