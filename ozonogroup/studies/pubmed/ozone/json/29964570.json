Scholars are beginning to study the potential of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a precursor to the formation of nitrogen disinfection by-products (DBP). In order to explore the mechanism of pre-ozonation coupled with enhanced coagulation on DON in the secondary effluent, the distributions of molecular weight and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of DON were analyzed. Disinfection by-product formation potential from chlorination was also investigated. Lastly, the composition and chemical structure of DON before and after coagulation were studied in combination with 3DEEM. Our results showed that pre-ozonation followed by coagulation with PACl significantly enhanced the removal of DON and mitigated DBP formation potentials. The following conclusions can be drawn from this study:\u2460 The tested effluent was very hard as indicated by total hardness and high calcium concentrations, and the pH had an important effect on pre-ozonation enhanced coagulation. As pH was decreased, the rates of DON, DOC and UV<sub>254</sub> removal increased. At pH 6.2, the rate of DON removal was maximal, and a 3.7 fold increase in removal-rate was achieved. \u2461 Calcium played a critical role in pre-ozonation enhanced coagulation. Zeta potentials and calcium concentrations were substantially affected at higher ozone doses. At ozone dosage of 8 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, Zeta potentials increased from -33 to -8 mV, and calcium concentrations decreased from 116 to 89 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. The ratio of calcium hardness to DOC was relatively high in this study, approaching 24 mg\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup> (CaCO<sub>3</sub>/DOC). Thus, pre-ozonation promoted the removal of DON by coagulation. \u2462 Large molecular weight and hydrophobic DON were easier to remove by coagulation. Ozonation modified the DON characteristics to become more hydrophilic and smaller in molecular weight. Coagulation reduced overall DBP formation potentials to less than 20%. Pre-ozonation enhanced coagulation decreased overall DBP formation potentials by more than 45%. \u2463 Finally, the 3DEEM spectra indicated that the formation potentials and DON characteristics, due to disinfection, were related to three main peaks, which corresponded to tryptophan-based proteins, aromatic proteins, and fulvic acids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yu-Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinyang Water Resources Survey Bureau, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Da-Xiang", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qing-Fei", "Initials": "QF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Mei", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guo-Zhong", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban Construction and Environmental Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964570", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201705142"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
