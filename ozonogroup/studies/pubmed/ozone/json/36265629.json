In this study, we use the brute-force method (BFM), process analysis (PA) and response surface model (RSM) to quantify the effects of BCs on simulated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in different regions of China by the weather research and forecasting with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. We combine the model with an integrated gas-phase reaction rate (IRR) tool to further analyze the changes in the O<sub>3</sub> chemical mechanisms. Our results show that the simulated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in western cities are significantly affected by the O<sub>3</sub> in the BCs (BC-O<sub>3</sub>), which can increase the maximum simulated O<sub>3</sub> concentration, such as in Lanzhou (36.6 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 26.3 %), Wuhai (30.1 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 25.5 %) and Urumqi (50.7 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, 41.2 %). In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> generation in the eastern region is dominated by emissions. Subsequently, we compare the reaction rate changes in O<sub>3</sub> generation and consumption under the effects of BC-O<sub>3</sub> in the western city of Urumqi and the eastern city of Beijing. The results show that in Beijing, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration and the related chemical reaction rates undergo little change, while in Urumqi, the concentration and reaction rates have significant differences. The BC-O<sub>3</sub> significantly accelerates the O<sub>3</sub> photochemical reaction process in Urumqi, resulting in increased O<sub>3</sub> generation and consumption reaction rates; additionally, there may be a chemical reaction pathway for the formation of O<sub>3</sub>: BC-O<sub>3</sub> + NO \u2192 NO<sub>2</sub> + hv \u2192 O + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 O<sub>3</sub>. BC-O<sub>3</sub> transmission is the main pathway of changes in the simulated O<sub>3</sub> concentration in the study area, and the chemical reactions between BC-O<sub>3</sub> and local pollutants are primarily characterized by O<sub>3</sub> consumption. In conclusion, the study shows the importance of BCs for regional model simulation while providing supporting information for O<sub>3</sub> formation in model studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
