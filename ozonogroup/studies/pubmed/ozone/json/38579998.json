However, the pollutant removal capacity offered by woody species strongly depends on eco-physiological and morphological traits. Woody species with higher stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) can remove more gases from the atmosphere, but other species can worsen air quality due to high O<sub>3</sub> forming potential (OFP), based on their emitting rates of biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) and Leaf Mass per Area (LMA). Presently, there is a lack of data on eco-physiological (g<sub>s</sub>, bVOCs emissions) and foliar traits (LMA) for several ornamental species used in urban greening programs, which does not allow assessment of their O<sub>3</sub> removal capacity and OFP. This study aimed to (i) parameterize g<sub>s</sub>, assess bVOCs emissions and LMA of 14 ornamental woody species commonly used in Mediterranean urban greening, and (ii) model their Net O<sub>3</sub> uptake. The g<sub>s</sub> Jarvis model was parameterized considering various environmental conditions alongside isoprene and monoterpene foliar bVOCs emission rates trapped in the field and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results are helpful for urban planning and landscaping; suggesting that Catalpa bignonioides and Gleditsia triacanthos have excellent O<sub>3</sub> removal capacity due to their high maximum g<sub>s</sub> (g<sub>max</sub>) equal to 0.657 and 0.597\u00a0mol H<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Regarding bVOCs, high isoprene (16.75\u00a0\u03bcg g<sub>dw</sub><sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and monoterpene (13.12\u00a0\u03bcg g<sub>dw</sub><sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) emission rates were found for Rhamnus alaternus and Cornus mas. In contrast, no bVOCs emissions were detected for Camellia sasanqua and Paulownia tomentosa. In conclusion, 11 species showed a positive Net O<sub>3</sub> uptake, while the use of large numbers of R. alaternus, C. mas, and Chamaerops humilis for urban afforestation planning are not recommended due to their potential to induce a deterioration of outdoor air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
