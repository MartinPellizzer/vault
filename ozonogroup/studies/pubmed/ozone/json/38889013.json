However, identifying key environmental drivers of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> formation remains challenging using traditional statistical methods, impeding effective emission control measures to mitigate NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-induced air pollution. Here, we adopted machine learning assisted by steady-state analysis to elucidate the driving factors of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> before and during the 2022 Winter Olympics (WO) in Beijing. Higher N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> concentrations were observed during the WO period compared to the Pre-Winter-Olympics (Pre-WO) period. The machine learning model accurately reproduced ambient N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> concentrations and showed that ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and relative humidity (RH) were the most important driving factors of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Compared to the Pre-WO period, the variation in trace gases (i.e., NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>) along with the reduced N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> uptake coefficient was the main reason for higher N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> levels during the WO period. By predicting N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> under various control scenarios of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> and calculating the nitrate formation potential from N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> uptake, we found that the progressive reduction of nitrogen oxides initially increases the nitrate formation potential before further decreasing it. The threshold of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> was approximately 13 ppbv, below which NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reduction effectively reduced the level of night-time nitrate formations. These results demonstrate the capacity of machine learning to provide insights into understanding atmospheric nitrogen chemistry and highlight the necessity of more stringent emission control of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> to mitigate haze pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aerosol and Haze Laboratory, Beijing Advanced Innovation
