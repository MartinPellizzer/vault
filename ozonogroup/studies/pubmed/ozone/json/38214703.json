Here, we systematically investigate the impact of different types of nonstoichiometric solid MO<sub>x</sub> (M are W or Mo) dopants obtained by oxidizing transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs: WSe<sub>2</sub> or MoS<sub>2</sub>) formed on graphene FETs, which results in <i>p</i>-type doping along with disorders. From the results obtained in this study, we were able to suggest an analytical technique to optimize the optimal UV-ozone (UVO) treatment to achieve high <i>p</i>-type doping concentration in graphene FETs (\u223c2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> in this study) without generating defects, mainly by analyzing the time dependency of <i>D</i> and <i>D</i>' peaks measured by Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, an analysis of the structure of graphene sheets using TEM indicates that WO<sub>x</sub> plays a better protective role in graphene, compared to MoO<sub>x</sub>, suggesting that WO<sub>x</sub> is more effective for preventing the degradation of graphene during UVO treatment. To enhance the practical application aspect of our work, we have fabricated a graphene photodetector by selectively doping the graphene through oxidized TMDs, creating a <i>p</i>-<i>n</i> junction, which resulted in improved photoresponsivity compared to the intrinsic graphene device. Our results offer a practical guideline for the utilization of surface charge transfer doping of graphene toward CMOS applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0007-4642-8132"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nano Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Huynh", "ForeName": "Tuyen", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nano Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Ngo", "ForeName": "Tien Dat", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nano Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyungyu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8448-4043"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Minsup", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8945-3097"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Advanced Composite Materials, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Wanju-gun, Jeolabuk-do 55324, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Wonki", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics (CINAP), Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Tuan Dung", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8508-1652"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Tran", "ForeName": "Trang Thu", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nano Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kwangro", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Advanced Composite Materials, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Wanju-gun, Jeolabuk-do 55324, Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Jun Yeon", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4679-0370"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeongyong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3767-7969"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SKKU Advanced Institute of Nano Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Won Jong", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38214703", "10.1021/acsami.3c16229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
