To better assess the health impacts of point sources of industrial air pollution, a randomized crossover exposure study was conducted. Sixty one young and healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to spend five consecutive eight-hour days near a steel mill or at a location five kilometres away. After a nine or sixteen-day washout period, volunteers spent another five consecutive days at the second site. Meteorological conditions and air pollutants were monitored at both exposure sites. On each exposure day, the first morning urine was collected along with a second urine sample obtained immediately before leaving the exposure site at the end of the day. Urinary levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage), malondialdehyde (MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation), 8-isoprostane (8-IsoP, a bioactive metabolite resulting from the peroxidation of arachidonic acid) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF, involved in response to oxidative stress) were measured. According to mixed-effects linear regression models, intra-individual variations in 8-OHdG urinary levels were significantly associated with exposure site, but surprisingly, lower levels were observed at the steel mill site. Delayed, temporally-defined associations with specific air pollutants were observed for 8-OHdG, 8-IsoP and VEGF. However, these associations were subtle, presented complex patterns and their biological consequences remain unclear."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright \u00a9 2016.
