Predictions of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from riverine systems are difficult and mostly accomplished via regression equations based on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations or fluxes, although recent studies have shown that hydromorphological characteristics can influence N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in riverine reaches. Here, we propose a predictive model for N<sub>2</sub>O riverine concentrations and emissions at the reach scale. The model is based on Damk\u00f6hler numbers and captures the primary effects of reach-scale biogeochemical and hydromorphological characteristics in flowing waters. It explains the change in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from small streams to large rivers under varying conditions including biome, land use, climate, and nutrient availability. The model and observed data show that dimensionless N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations and emission rates have higher variability and mean values for small streams (reach width <10 m) than for larger streams due to high spatial variability of stream hydraulics and morphology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
