Basic statistical methods, including the empirical orthogonal function (EOF), climatic tendency rate, and climatic trend coefficient analysis, were used here. The results showed that <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) was higher in northern and western Hainan than that in other regions, with the maximum value occurring in Dongfang City (91.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>). Twelve cities and counties experienced a downward trend from 2015 to 2020, and six cities and counties reached a 95% confidence level. The variation in <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) in Hainan Province demonstrated remarkable seasonal changes, which were the largest in the autumn, spring, and winter followed by the smallest in the summer, exhibiting a clear declining trend in all seasons except autumn. In addition, the cumulative variance of the first two eigenvector fields decomposed by EOF was 72.58%, which could well describe the distributed characteristics of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) in Hainan Province. The first mode reflected the consistency of <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) variation, and the second mode reflected regional differences. Meanwhile, the change in <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) had a good correlation with the precursors and meteorological factors. Among them, the correlation coefficients between <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) and <i>\u03c1</i>(NO<sub>2</sub>), precipitation, sunshine duration, average temperature, average wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and total radiation passed the 99% confidence test. The results of multiple linear regression showed that the variation in regressed <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) was consistent with the observed <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h), and the correlation coefficient between them was 0.853, which passed the 99.9% confidence test. The regression value explained 0.72 variance of the observed value."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chuan-Bo", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-Shuai", "Initials": "WS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Jin-He", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35075841", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202105103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
