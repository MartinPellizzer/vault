Because ozone itself does not penetrate the cells but immediately reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids, its effects should be the results of oxidative reaction. For this reason, ozonated oils could be a way to deliver ozone messengers to the skin. This paper evaluated the therapeutic effects of three different grades of ozonated sesame oil in acute cutaneous wounds made in the skin of SKH1 mice. Specifically, wound closure rate, histological parameters, and the level of key proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factors and cyclin D1 have been analyzed in relation to the peroxide level present in the ozonated oil. Treatment with moderately ozonated sesame oil--expressed as peroxide value about 1,500)--has a faster wound closure rate in the first 7 days than treatment with oil containing either lower or higher peroxide value, and even with controls. Moreover, under the same treatment, an earlier and higher response of cells involved in wound repair, a higher angiogenesis, as well as an enhanced vascular endothelial growth factors and cyclin D1 expression were observed. The present study shows the validity of ozonated sesame oil in cutaneous wound healing and emphasizes the importance of the ozonation grade."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2010 by the Wound Healing Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Siena, Siena, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Yunsook", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belmonte", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miracco", "ForeName": "Clelia", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zanardi", "ForeName": "Iacopo", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bocci", "ForeName": "Velio", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Travagli", "ForeName": "Valter", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Wound Repair Regen", "NlmUniqueID": "9310939", "ISSNLinking": "1067-1927"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ccnd1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "136601-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin D1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8008-74-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesame Oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin D1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Hairless"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesame Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds, Penetrating"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21134039", "10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00649.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
