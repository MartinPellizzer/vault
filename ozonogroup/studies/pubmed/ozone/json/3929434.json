Exposure to 0.2 and 0.4 ppm O3 increased NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activity and cytochrome P-450 as well as microsomal protein by the 14th day, whereas NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was not affected. The most marked increase was observed in cytochrome P-450. In parallel to this increment, the activities of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase of exposed animals increased significantly on the 7th and 14th days of exposure to 0.2 and 0.4 ppm 03. In contrast, exposure to 1.2 and 4 ppm NO2 decreased cytochrome P-450 on the 7th day. Moreover, the 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity in exposed animals decreased to 61% (P less than 0.05) and 74% (P less than 0.001) of control on the 7th and 14th days of exposure to 4 ppm NO2, respectively. This decrease occurred in a dose-dependent manner with exposure to 0.4-4.0 ppm NO2, whilst benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity was not affected. These results show that O3 at low doses induces xenobiotic metabolizing activities in the lung, whereas NO2 reduces this."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "7-Alkoxycoumarin O-Dealkylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrene Hydroxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.2.4", "NameOfSubstance": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "7-Alkoxycoumarin O-Dealkylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrene Hydroxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3929434", "10.1016/0378-4274(85)90159-6", "0378-4274(85)90159-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
