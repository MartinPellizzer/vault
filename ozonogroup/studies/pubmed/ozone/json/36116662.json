In developing countries such as China, however, the cohort evidence was extremely rare. In this study, we aimed to establish the concentration-response relationship between long-term exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and mortality in Chinese adults.", "We conducted a prospective cohort study followed up from 2011 to 2018, by enrolling 15,440 participants aged \u226545 years from 28 provincial regions of China. NO<sub>2</sub> concentration estimates were derived from high-quality spatiotemporal datasets developed by machine learning methods and were assigned for each participant according to their residential cities. We applied Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying exposures to assess the association of all-cause death with long-term NO<sub>2</sub> exposure. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify effect modifications.", "A total of 1646 death events occurred during 105,478.5 person-years' follow-up (median 7.1 years). No evident violation for linear NO<sub>2</sub>-mortality relationship (P nonlinear = 0.332) was observed at a range of 7.4-45.0 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Per 10-\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> rise in NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with an hazard ratio of 1.220 (95% confidence interval: 1.103-1.350) for all-cause mortality. The association between NO<sub>2</sub> and mortality was generally robust after adjusting for co-pollutants including fine particulate matter or/and ozone. Only participants aged 65 and over (1.351 [1.193-1.531]) suffered from increased risks of death associated with NO<sub>2</sub> exposure, and an evident effect modification by age (P = 0.008) was identified. The elevated risk of death induced by NO<sub>2</sub> was also observed in participants living in rural areas and those with elementary school education or below, though effect modifications were non-significant in these subgroups.", "This study provided novel evidence that long-term NO<sub>2</sub> exposure could be an independent risk for mortality among Chinese middle-aged and older adults.
