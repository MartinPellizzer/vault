We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study among 86\u2005635 emergency hospital admissions for stroke across 10 hospitals in 3 cities (Jinhua, Hangzhou, and Zhoushan) in Zhejiang province, China, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2021. Using a conditional logistic regression combined with a distributed lag linear model, we estimated the association between hourly exposure to multiple air pollutants and risk of emergency hospital admissions for total stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and undetermined type.", "Hourly exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> was associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions for total stroke and ischemic stroke. The associations were most pronounced during the concurrent hour of exposure and lasted for \u22482 hours. We found that the risk was more pronounced among male patients or those aged <65 years old.", "Our findings suggest that exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>, but not CO and O<sub>3</sub>, is associated with emergency hospital admissions for total stroke or ischemic stroke shortly after exposure. Implementing targeted pollution emission reduction measures may have significant public health implications in controlling and reducing the burden of stroke."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
