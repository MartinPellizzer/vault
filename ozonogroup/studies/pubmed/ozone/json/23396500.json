We present a facile and green hydrothermal method for synthesizing monodisperse Pt nanocubes (Pt-NCs) with polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) as a complex-forming agent, capping agent and facet-selective agent, and formaldehyde as a reductant. The formation mechanism, particle size and surface composition of the Pt-NCs were investigated by Ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. In the proposed PAH-K(2)PtCl(4)-HCHO synthesis system, the raw material could be reutilized to re-synthesize the Pt-NCs, and the particle size of the Pt-NCs could be readily controlled by the reduction rate of the Pt(II) species in the Pt(II)-PAH complex. After UV/Ozone and electrochemical cleaning, the residual PAH on the Pt-NC surfaces still strongly influenced the d-band centre of Pt due to the strong N-Pt interaction. The as-prepared 6 nm Pt-NCs showed superior electrocatalytic activity (mass activity and specific activity) and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both H(2)SO(4) and HClO(4) electrolytes compared to the commercial E-TEK Pt black, owing to the combination of the facets effect and electronic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Power Batteries, College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gengtao", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Xian", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yiming", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Shaohua", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Yawen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Tianhong", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Xinghua", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23396500", "10.1039/c3cp44191a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
