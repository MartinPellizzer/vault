With ozone doses of 1, 4, and 7 mg/L, high-molecular-weight humic acid was cleaved into low-molecular-weight particles and accumulated at group 6 (molecular weight < or = 4000 g/mole) on the Sephadex G-75 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) fraction. Furthermore, the molecular-size distribution of organic compounds by Sephadex G-25 was shifted from groups 2 (molecular weight = 4000 to 400 g/mole) and 3 (molecular weight = 400 to 180 g/mole) to groups 2, 3, and 4 (molecular weight < or = 180 g/mole) under ozone doses of 1 and 4 mg/L. An increased ozone dose destroyed functional groups C=C and C-O of aromatic and phenolic compounds and increased UV-insensitive biodegradable organic carbon for subsequent biofiltration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Safety, Health and Environmental Engineering, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan. yhlinl@ctust.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yen-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsien", "ForeName": "Hsin-Jung", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21657196", "10.2175/106143010x12851009156088"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
