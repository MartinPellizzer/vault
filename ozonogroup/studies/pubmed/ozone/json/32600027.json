Here we quantify the effects of chlorine on fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone air quality across China by using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model with comprehensive anthropogenic emissions and detailed representation of gas-phase and heterogeneous chlorine chemistry. Comparison of the model to observed ClNO<sub>2</sub>, HCl, and particulate Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations shows that reactive chlorine in China is mainly anthropogenic, unlike in other continental regions where it is mostly of marine origin. The model is successful in reproducing observed concentrations and their distributions, lending confidence in the anthropogenic chlorine emission estimates and the resulting chemistry. We find that anthropogenic chlorine emissions increase total inorganic PM<sub>2.5</sub> by as much as 3.2 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> on an annual mean basis through the formation of ammonium chloride, partly compensated by a decrease of nitrate because ClNO<sub>2</sub> formation competes with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> hydrolysis. Annual mean MDA8 surface ozone increases by up to 1.9 ppb, mainly from ClNO<sub>2</sub> chemistry, while reactivities of volatile organic compounds increase (by up to 48% for ethane). We find that a sufficient representation of chlorine chemistry in air quality models can be obtained from consideration of HCl/Cl<sup>-</sup> thermodynamics and ClNO<sub>2</sub> chemistry, because other more complicated aspects of chlorine chemistry have a relatively minor effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8532-5773"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Jacob", "ForeName": "Daniel J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2993-0522"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4765-9377"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Breton", "ForeName": "Michael Le", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5691-1231"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Hallquist", "ForeName": "Mattias", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zirui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6845-6077"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Atmospheric Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Energy, Environment, and Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130, United States."}], "LastName": "McDuffie", "ForeName": "Erin E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32600027", "10.1021/acs.est.0c02296"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
