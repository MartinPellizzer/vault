Exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), PM<sub>10</sub>, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was assessed by extracting daily concentrations from a validated grid dataset based on each subject's residential address. Conditional logistic regression models were applied for exposure-response analyses.", "There were 47,108 case days and 159,852 control days during the study period. Each 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of lag 04-day exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> was significantly associated with a 1.43 % (95 % CI: 0.77, 2.09 %), 1.06 % (0.59, 1.54 %), and 2.80 % (1.51, 4.10 %) increase in odds of dementia mortality, corresponding to an excess mortality of 4.87 %, 5.50 %, and 6.43 %, respectively. We estimated that reducing ambient air pollutant exposures to the WHO air quality guidelines would avoid up to 4.17 % of the dementia deaths, while the ambient air quality standards in China would only help avoid up to 0.39 %.", "This study provides consistent evidence that short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> is associated with increased odds of dementia mortality, which can be translated to a considerable excess mortality.
