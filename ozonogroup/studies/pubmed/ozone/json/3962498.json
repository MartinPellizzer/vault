The concept of the Swiss air pollution control policy is based on two steps. In a first step, all emissions are limited providently. In a second step, the emissions have to be limited more severely, if it is certain or if it can be expected that the air pollution is harmful or annoying to human health or to the environment. The new ordinance on air pollution control is of great importance in abating air pollution. This ordinance will enter into force on March 1st, 1986. Is contains regulations for industrial sources and for heating systems, for instance emission limits for a number of pollutants, regulations for construction and operation of stationary installations, limits for the maximum content of pollutants in fuels. Moreover, stringent exhaust regulations for new passenger cars will enter into force on October 1st, 1987. Although important measures to reduce air pollution have already been taken in Switzerland, further efforts are necessary to guarantee a sufficient protection of human health and environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leutert", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Massnahmen gegen die Luftverschmutzung."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Soz Praventivmed", "NlmUniqueID": "7502479", "ISSNLinking": "0303-8408"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Switzerland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3962498", "10.1007/BF02103741"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
