Recently, the usage of sunscreens for skin protection has increased because the amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface has increased owing to the destruction of the ozone layer that blocks UV radiation. Hydrogels with a three-dimensional network structure exhibit physical and chemical properties that are similar to those of the extracellular matrix in the human body, a high water content, flexibility, and biocompatibility. Therefore, they are applied in a wide range of fields, such as in cosmetics, medicines, and pharmaceuticals. However, conventional hydrogel-based sunscreens have drawbacks such as complicated process conditions, high cost, and low biocompatibility. In this study, a novel hydrogel-type sunscreen with excellent UV protection and cooling effects was prepared by a very simple process using two natural materials, hyaluronic acid (HA) and tannic acid (TA). The HA/TA hydrogels exhibited broad-spectrum UV protection in the UVA and UVB regions (280-360\u00a0nm). In addition, they showed excellent adhesion to the skin surface, antioxidative activity, cooling effect, and high moisture content, demonstrating great application potential as a hydrogel-type sunscreen."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
