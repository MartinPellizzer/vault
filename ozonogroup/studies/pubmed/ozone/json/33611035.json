Therefore, an advanced oxidation process is a promising step in post or pre-treatment of leachate. In this study, the effects of Fenton and ozone oxidation on the removal of 16 emerging micropollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, alkylphenols and pesticides were investigated. The Fenton and ozone oxidation of the leachate were performed with four (reaction time: 20-90\u00a0min, Fe(II) dose: 0.51-2.55\u00a0g/L, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dose: 5.1-25.5\u00a0g/L and pH: 3-5) and two (ozonation time: 10-130\u00a0min and pH: 4-10) independent variables, respectively. Among these operating conditions, reaction time played more significant role (p-value < 0.05) in eliminating di-(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate, 4-nonylphenol and 4-tert-octylphenol for both processes. The results showed that Fenton and ozone oxidation processes had a high degradation potential for micropollutants except for the PAHs including four and more rings. Removal efficiencies of micropollutants by ozone and Fenton oxidation were determined in the range of 5-100%. Although the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and some micropollutants such as phthalates were found much higher in the Fenton process than ozonation, the degradation products occurred during the Fenton oxidation were a higher molecular weight. Moreover, the oxidation intermediates for the both processes were found as mainly benzaldehyde, pentanoic acid and hydro cinnamic acid as well as derivatives of naphthalenone and naphthalenediol. Also, acid ester with higher molecular weight, naphthalene-based and phenolic compounds were detected in the Fenton oxidation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
