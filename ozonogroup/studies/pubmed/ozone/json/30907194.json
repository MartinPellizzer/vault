Air pollution was measured at baseline in the schools. Respiratory symptoms and the home environment were assessed by a questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> The 2-year onset was 14.3%, 23.2%, 15.4%, 4.7% and 37.3% for wheeze, daytime attacks of breathlessness, nocturnal cough, nocturnal wheeze/breathlessness and respiratory infections, respectively. The mean concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2,</sub> ozone and CO<sub>2</sub> in the classrooms were 129\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 68.0\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 43.2\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, 8.6\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> and 1208\u2009ppm, respectively. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), dampness/mold at home and ozone in the classroom were associated with onset of wheeze. Onset of daytime breathlessness was associated with redecoration and dampness/mold at home and CO<sub>2</sub> and relative air humidity (RH) in the classrooms. Dampness/mold at home, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and RH in the classrooms and outdoor PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were associated with onset of nocturnal cough. Onset of nocturnal wheeze/breathlessness was associated with dampness/mold at home and RH and PM<sub>10</sub> in the classrooms. Respiratory infections were more common at higher levels of outdoor PM<sub>10</sub>. <b>Conclusions:</b> Air pollution (PM<sub>10</sub>, ozone, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) and inadequate ventilation flow in the classrooms (indicated by CO<sub>2</sub>\u2009>\u20091000\u2009ppm) and ETS, dampness or mold and chemical emissions from redecoration at home can increase onset of respiratory symptoms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tian", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2298-8972"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chenghuan", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zhuohui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Sciences, Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Norback", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asian People"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspnea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Housing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Sounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30907194", "10.1080/02770903.2019.1590591"]}}]}
