The historical assessment for 2013-2019 is based on gridded O<sub>3</sub> concentrations generated by a multi-source-data-fusion algorithm; the future prediction for 2019-2030 uses gridded O<sub>3</sub> concentrations projected by four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios. During 2013-2019, national annual O<sub>3</sub>-mortality is 176.3 thousand (95%CI: 123.5-224.0 thousand) averaged over 2013-2019 with an increasing trend of 14.1 thousand yr<sup>-1</sup> (95%CI: 10.2-17.4 thousand yr<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>); sensitivity experiments show that the O<sub>3</sub>-mortality varies at a rate of +12.7 (95%CI: 9.2-15.6), +5.8 (95%CI: 4.0-7.4), +1.0 (95%CI: 0.7-1.2), -5.4 (95%CI: -6.9 to -3.7) thousand yr<sup>-1</sup>, owing to changes in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, population age structure, population size, mortality rate for respiratory disease, respectively. The deterioration of O<sub>3</sub> air quality, shown as significant increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration, is identified as the primary factor which contributes 90.1 % of 2013-2019 O<sub>3</sub>-mortality rise. Compared with O<sub>3</sub>-mortality estimated in this study, the widely-used O<sub>3</sub>-mortality assessment method based on urban-site-dominant O<sub>3</sub> measurements generates close national O<sub>3</sub>-mortality but overestimates (underestimates) provincial O<sub>3</sub>-mortality in coastal (central) provinces. From 2019 to 2030, national O<sub>3</sub>-mortality is projected to increase by 50.4-103.7 thousand under different SSP scenarios. The change in age structure (i.e. population aging) alone will result in significant O<sub>3</sub>-mortality rises of 137.9-160.5 thousand. Compared with 2013-2019 rapid O<sub>3</sub> increase (+2.5 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> at national level), O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are projected to increase at a lower rate (+0.4 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in SSP5-8.5) or even decrease (-0.7 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in SSP1-2.6) from 2019 to 2030. Therefore, population aging, in place of O<sub>3</sub> air quality deterioration, will become the leading cause of future O<sub>3</sub>-mortality rises during the coming decade."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
