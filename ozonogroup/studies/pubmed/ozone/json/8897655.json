Rabbits were exposed for 7 h to either room temperature-humidified filtered air (n = 7) or 0.2 ppm O3 in humidified room air (n = 5). Tracheal PD was recorded 3 h after exposure. Whole lung resistance (RL) and reactivity were partitioned into their central (RC) and peripheral (RP) components using a retrograde catheter and forced oscillation. Changes in RL, RC, and RP in response to NaCl (0.9%) and ACh (100 mM) aerosol challenges were measured before and after vagotomy. Exposure to O3 decreased tracheal PD from -29 +/- 0.6 mV in air-exposed rabbits to -15 +/- 2 mV in O3-exposed rabbits (p < or = 0.0001). Exposure to O3 did not alter RL, RC, or RP. However, the ACh-induced increase in RL in O3-exposed rabbits (140%) was twice that recorded in the air-exposed group (p < or = 0.01). While changes in RP dominated the whole lung response to ACh in air-exposed rabbits, changes in RC were most prominent in the O3-exposed group. Bilateral vagotomy did not alter airway reactivity in control rabbits but did enhance peripheral lung reactivity in O3-exposed rabbits. We conclude that exposure to 0.2 ppm O3 for 7 h affects tracheal epithelial function in rabbits and increases central airway reactivity via vagal mechanisms without altering baseline RL, RC, or RP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freed", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fuller", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Croxton", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL50579", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Respir Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0047142", "ISSNLinking": "0034-5687"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vagotomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vagus Nerve"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8897655", "10.1016/0034-5687(96)00040-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
