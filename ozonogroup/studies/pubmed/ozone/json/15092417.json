Karst.) cultivated in sand and provided with a complete nutrient solution, or a solution deficient in magnesium and calcium, were exposed to the pollutant mixtures SO(2)/NO(2), O(3)/NO(2), and O(3)/SO(2)/NO(2), at realistic concentrations for 32 weeks. Fumigation caused a slight increase of total N contents in current year needles, whereas in one-year-old needles N concentrations did not change. The response of nitrate reductase activity to pollutant stress depended on needle age and nutrient supply, respectively. In one-year-old needles fumigation resulted in a significant inhibition of enzyme activity, particularly in Mg and Ca deficient trees. The combination of all three components proved to be most effective in causing a decrease by 60% compared to the control. In contrast, nitrate reductase activity was stimulated in current year needles, especially by O(3)/NO(2) and O(3)/SO(2)/NO(2). Changes in the activity of nitrate and nitrite reductases are considered as a factor contributing to the high phytotoxic potential of pollutant combinations with NO(2)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Botanik, Universit\u00e4t Essen, Universit\u00e4tsstr. 5 D4300 Essen, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klumpp", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00fcppers", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guderian", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092417", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90138-3", "0269749189901383"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
