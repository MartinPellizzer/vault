This study was based on model experiments at neutral pH and temperature. Fresh apples were treated with two different levels of mancozeb (1 and 10 microg/mL). Several of the treatments were effective in reducing or removing mancozeb and ETU residues on spiked apples. Mancozeb residues decreased 56-99% with chlorine and 36-87% with chlorine dioxide treatments. ETU was completely degraded by 500 ppm of calcium hypochlorite and 10 ppm of chlorine dioxide at a 1 ppm spike level. However, at a 10 ppm spike level, the effectiveness of ETU degradation was lower than observed at 1 ppm level. Mancozeb residues decreased 56-97% with ozone treatment. At 1 and 3 ppm of ozone, no ETU residue was detected at 1 ppm of spiked mancozeb after both 3 and 30 min. HPA was also effective in degrading the mancozeb residues, with 44-99% reduction depending on treatment time and HPA concentrations. ETU was completely degraded at 500 ppm of HPA after 30 min of reaction time. These treatments indicated good potential for the removal of pesticide residues on fruit and in processed products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Institute for Environmental Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cash", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zabik", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12427-38-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Maneb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R0HY55EB9E", "NameOfSubstance": "mancozeb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X1FSB1OZPT", "NameOfSubstance": "Zineb"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Decontamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Maneb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosales"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Zineb"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11410019", "10.1021/jf010234h", "jf010234h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
