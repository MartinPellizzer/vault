Animals were exposed to various concentrations (0, 1, 3, 10 and 20% v/v) of a primary-treated effluent and also after a treatment with ozone at 10 mg/L in continuous flow-through mode for seven weeks. A suite of biomarkers was used to assess the potential toxic effects of various contaminants typically present in municipal wastewaters: heavy metal metabolism (metallothioneins and labile zinc), cytochrome P4501A1 and 3A4, glutathione S-transferase activities (biotransformation of organic compounds), lipid peroxidation and xanthine oxidoreductase (oxygen radical scavenging), DNA damage, mitochondrial electron transport activity at various temperatures and gonad lipid levels (cellular energy allocation) and aspartate transcarbamoylase and dihydrofolate reductase (gonad activity). On the one hand, some biomarkers, including metallothioneins, labile zinc, glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P4503A4 activity, dehydrofolate reductase and aspartate transcarbamoylase, were readily decreased. In contrast, these biomarkers, cytochrome P4501A1, gill lipid peroxidation, DNA strand breaks in gills and digestive gland, mitochondrial electron transport at high and low temperatures (temperature-dependent activity) and total gonad lipids, were readily increased. In general, ozone treatment reduced adverse effects by either decreasing the intensity of the toxic responses or increasing the threshold concentration. For gill lipid peroxidation, however, intensity was greater at a higher threshold concentration. Ozone treatment eliminated the temperature sensitivity of the mitochondrial electron transport system, indicating a loss of interaction between temperature and urban pollution in terms of energy expenditure in mussels. Ozone treatment could significantly decrease either the toxic potency or intensity of urban pollutants at the expense of increased oxidative stress in gills of freshwater mussels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "St. Lawrence Centre, Environment Canada, 105 Mc Gill, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada. francois.gagne@ec.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gagn\u00e9", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andr\u00e9", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cejka", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gagnon", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blaise", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "100959500", "ISSNLinking": "1532-0456"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9038-94-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Metallothionein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bivalvia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Breaks"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metallothionein"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17383941", "10.1016/j.cbpc.2007.01.019", "S1532-0456(07)00073-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
