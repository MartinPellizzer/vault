Throughout the sampling period, 3\u00a0days with high O<sub>3</sub> levels (maximum hourly O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0100 ppbv) were captured at both sites (pattern 1) and 13\u00a0days with O<sub>3</sub> episodes occurred only at QA (pattern 2). It was found that O<sub>3</sub> formation at TC was VOC-limited in both patterns because of the large local NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. However, the O<sub>3</sub> formation at QA was co-limited by VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> in pattern 1, but VOC-limited in pattern 2. In both patterns, isoprene, formaldehyde, xylenes and trimethylbenzenes were the top 4 VOCs that modulated local O<sub>3</sub> formation at QA, while they were isoprene, formaldehyde, xylenes and toluene at TC. In pattern 1, the net O<sub>3</sub> production rate at QA (13.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup>) was high, and comparable (p\u00a0=\u00a00.40) to that at TC (12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup>), so was the hydroxyl radical (i.e., OH), implying high atmospheric oxidative capacity over PRE. In contrast, the net O<sub>3</sub> production rate was significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at QA (16.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup>) than that at TC (4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 ppbv h<sup>-1</sup>) in pattern 2, and the OH concentration and cycling rate were also higher, indicating much stronger photochemical reactions at QA. These findings enhanced our understanding of O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry in the Pearl River estuary, which could be extended to other estuaries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
