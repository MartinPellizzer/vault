The regeneration performance, stability of [Bmim]BF<sub>4</sub>, and roles of hydrogen bonds between O<sub>3</sub> and [Bmim]BF<sub>4</sub> in the phenol removal were studied. The experimental results showed that 90.2% of phenol was degraded in [Bmim]BF<sub>4</sub> after ozonation treatment for 30 min with the O<sub>3</sub> concentration of 1.2 mg/L. The nonvolatility of [Bmim]BF<sub>4</sub>-made phenol was adequately degraded, while the concentration of phenol increased during ozone treatment in the conventional extractants (ethanol, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane) due to their high volatility. The reuse experiments, spectra of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that [Bmim]BF<sub>4</sub> was steady under the ozonation process. Density functional theory simulation confirmed that hydrogen bonds between [Bmim]<sup>+</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> could be formed, and calculational results of Hirshfeld charges indicated that the nucleophilicity of O<sub>3</sub> was enhanced by the hydrogen bonds. The enhanced nucleophilicity resulted in the increase of phenol degradation efficiency by ozonation, and the synergistic effect between O<sub>3</sub> and ILs was proportional to the hydrogen bond donor ability of ILs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petroleum Engineering and Environmental Engineering, Yan'an University, Yan'an, 716000, China. renjingyuyau@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China. renjingyuyau@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yan'an Key Laboratory of Environmental Monitoring and Remediation, Yan'an, 716000, China. renjingyuyau@163.com."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Jingyu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petroleum Engineering and Environmental Engineering, Yan'an University, Yan'an, 716000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yan'an Key Laboratory of Environmental Monitoring and Remediation, Yan'an, 716000, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Petroleum Engineering and Environmental Engineering, Yan'an University, Yan'an, 716000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yan'an Key Laboratory of Environmental Monitoring and Remediation, Yan'an, 716000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "YDBK2020-02", "Agency": "Yan'an University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Density Functional Theory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Afzal S, Xie Q, Chen S, Wang J, Muhammad D (2016) Synthesis of manganese incorporated hierarchical mesoporous silica nanosphere with fibrous morphology by facile one-pot approach for efficient catalytic ozonation.
