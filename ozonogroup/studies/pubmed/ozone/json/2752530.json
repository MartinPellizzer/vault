In this investigation we further characterize the oncogenic action of ozone, alone or in combination with radiation, on C3H10T1/2 cells with particular emphasis on transformation produced by different temporal patterns of dose delivery of these two agents and low dose effects. We report that ozone-induced transformation involves the activation of dominant transforming genes, thereby indicating that DNA is a target in ozone induced carcinogenesis. We also report that ozone (5 p.p.m. for 5 min) acts as a synergistic co-carcinogen only if delivered after radiation (4 Gy or gamma-rays); when cells are exposed to ozone prior to radiation no enhanced rates of transformation are observed. Our findings also show that ozone at a low dose of 1 p.p.m. (for 5 min) does not act as a carcinogen but does interact as a co-carcinogen with ionizing radiation. The data indicate that the dose and sequence in which ozone and radiation are delivered have important implications for the putative carcinogenic effects of these two agents, a factor that heretofore has not been recognized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiological Research Laboratory, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borek", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaider", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-12536", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2752530", "10.1093/carcin/10.8.1549"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
