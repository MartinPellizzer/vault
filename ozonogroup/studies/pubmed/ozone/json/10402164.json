The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance of particulate and gaseous air pollution as predictors of daily mortality. Concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP), inhalable particles (PM10), and gaseous pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, were measured daily during the study period. A generalized additive model was used to regress daily death counts on each air pollutant, controlling for time trend and meteorologic influences such as temperature or relative humidity. Total mortality was found to increase 1.2% (95% CI: 0.2 to 2.2%) for each 10 microg/m3 increase in 6-day moving average of TSP, and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2 to 2.1%) for each 10 microg/m3 increase in 5-day moving average of PM10. The association is similar in magnitude to associations between particulate air pollution and mortality found in several other communities in America and Europe. Associations with gaseous pollutants were all statistically insignificant in the generalized additive model. The relative risk of death increased at particulate levels that were well below the current Korean Ambient Air Quality Standard."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Inha University, College of Medicine, Inchon, Korea. ychong@dragon.inha.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leem", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Korean Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8703518", "ISSNLinking": "1011-8934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10402164", "PMC3054386", "10.3346/jkms.1999.14.3.239"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
