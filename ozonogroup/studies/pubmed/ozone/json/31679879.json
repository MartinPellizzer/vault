Negative impact of O<sub>3</sub> on some common crops such as wheat and soybeans has been widely recognized, but there is relatively little information about maize, the typical C4 plant and third most important crop worldwide. To partly compensate this knowledge gap, the maize cultivar (Zhengdan 958, ZD958) with maximum planting area in China was exposed to a range of chronic ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) exposures in open top chambers (OTCs). The O<sub>3</sub> effects on this highly important crop were estimated in relation to two O<sub>3</sub> metrics, AOT40 (accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration over a threshold of 40\u202fppb during daylight hours) and POD<sub>6</sub> (Phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> Dose above a threshold flux of 6\u202fnmol O<sub>3</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> during a specified period). We found that (1) the reduced light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (A<sub>sat</sub>) mainly caused by non-stomatal limitations across heading and grain filling stages, but the stomatal limitations at the former stage were stronger than those at the latter stage; (2) impact of O<sub>3</sub> on water use efficiency (WUE) of maize was significantly dependent on developmental stage; (3) yield loss induced by O<sub>3</sub> was mainly due to a reduction in kernels weight rather than in the number of kernels; (4) the performance of AOT40 and POD<sub>6</sub> was similar, according to their determination coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>); (5) the order of O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity among different parameters was photosynthetic parameters\u202f>\u202fbiomass parameters\u202f>\u202fyield-related parameters; (6) Responses of A<sub>sat</sub> to O<sub>3</sub> between heading and gran filling stages were significantly different based on AOT40 metric, but not POD<sub>6</sub>. The proposed O<sub>3</sub> metrics-response relationships will be valuable for O<sub>3</sub> risk assessment in Asia and also for crop productivity models including the influence of O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
