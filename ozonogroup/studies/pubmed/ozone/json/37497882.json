The climate change has a major impact not only on natural disasters of the Earth but also on human health. The climate crisis is then no longer a future concern. It includes both the global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Global warming can occur from a variety of causes, both natural and human induced. The primary GHG in Earth's atmosphere, listed in decreasing order of average global mole fraction, are: water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Today, scientists around the world continue to try and solve the puzzle of climate change. It is clear that to address climate change, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released into the atmosphere by industrial process has to be reduced because once it is added to the atmosphere, it can continue to affect climate for thousands of years. For such a purpose, an approach to intervention using expression vectors for any protein targeting to the cell plasma membrane <i>via</i> the glycosylphosphatidylinositol, GPI, anchor is suggested. The resulting GPI-anchored proteins would be useful for studying intermolecular interactions, especially gene-environment interactions, in investigating the potential impact of any chemical compounds on any genes of interest and could be used for carbonic anhydrase (CA)-based CO<sub>2</sub>-capture (environmental application). This approach would be crucial not only for capturing CO<sub>2</sub> <i>via</i> GPI and CA but also for the production of CA enzyme as well as its stabilization and therefore useful for combating the global warming of climate change."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Imaging, Jiangsu Vocational College of Medicine, Yancheng, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Huili", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Kefeng", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medical Imaging, Jiangsu Vocational College of Medicine, Yancheng, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Khue Vu", "Initials": "KV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "100892832", "ISSNLinking": "1525-7770"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonic Anhydrases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonic Anhydrases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37497882", "10.1080/15257770.2023.2238781"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
