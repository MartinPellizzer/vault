The combination of automated SPE and GC/HRMS for the analysis of nitrosamines has not been reported previously. The method shows as advantages the selectivity and sensitivity of GC/HRMS analysis and the high efficiency of automated SPE with coconut charcoal EPA 521 cartridges. Low method detection limits (MDLs) were achieved, along with a greater facility of the procedure and less dependence on the operator with regard to the methods based on manual SPE. Quality requirements for isotope dilution-based methods were accomplished for most analysed nitrosamines, regarding to trueness (80-120%), method precision (<15%) and MDLs (0.08-1.7 ng/L). Nineteen water samples (16 samples from a drinking water treatment plant {DWTP}, 2 chlorinated samples from a sewage treatment plant {STP} effluent, and 1 chlorinated sample from a reservoir) were analysed. Concentrations of nitrosamines in the STP effluent were 309.4 and 730.2 ng/L, being higher when higher doses of chlorine were applied. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) were the main compounds identified in the STP effluent, and NDEA was detected above 200 ng/L, regulatory level for NDMA in effluents stated in Ontario (Canada). Lower concentrations of nitrosamines were found in the reservoir (20.3 ng/L) and in the DWTP samples (n.d. -28.6 ng/L). NDMA and NDEA were respectively found in the reservoir and in treated and highly chlorinated DWTP samples at concentrations above 10 ng/L (guide value established in different countries). The highest concentrations of nitrosamines were found after chlorination and ozonation processes (ozonated, treated and highly chlorinated water) in DWTP samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Department of Ecotechnologies, IIQAB, CSIC, Jordi Girona Salgado 18, 08034 Barcelona, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Planas", "ForeName": "Carles", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palacios", "ForeName": "Oscar", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ventura", "ForeName": "Francesc", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivera", "ForeName": "Josep", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caixach", "ForeName": "Josep", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Talanta", "NlmUniqueID": "2984816R", "ISSNLinking": "0039-9140"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IQ78TTX1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Automation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18656677", "10.1016/j.talanta.2008.04.060", "S0039-9140(08)00334-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
