Real time on-line monitoring of ozone in the reaction module was possible using flow injection analysis coupled with a computer-controlled UV detector and data acquisition system. The effects of the soil media and size, ozone dosage, pH and p-CBA as a probe compound were examined at the given experimental conditions. Two apparent phases existed, and ozone instantaneously decomposed within one second in the first phase. These were defined as the instantaneous ozone demand (ID) phase, and the relatively slow decay stage. The interactions of ozone with the soil organic matter (SOM) and metal oxides were attributed mostly to the instantaneous decomposition of ozone. From the probe (p-CBA) experiments, 60-68% of total p-CBA removal occurred during the ID phase. The generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) was demonstrated and was closely related with metal oxides as well as SOM. Metal oxides in soil surface were considered to have relatively faster reaction rate with ozone and provide more favorable reactive sites to generate higher amount of OH. than SOM. Even at one-tenth concentration of the sands, a goethite-induced catalytic reaction outfitted the removal rate ofp-CBA among all the soils tested. More than 40% of total p-CBA removal occurred on the soil surface. It was inferred that the radical reaction with the probe compound seemed to take place not only on the soil surface but also in the solid-liquid interface. Ozone decomposition and the reaction between OH. and p-CBA appeared to be independent of any change in pH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Environment Research Department, Hyundia MOBIS, Gyunggi-du, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Hyung-Nam", "Initials": "HN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hechul", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Tae-Moon", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Joon-Wun", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11766798", "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00239-1", "S0043-1354(01)00239-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
