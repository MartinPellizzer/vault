However, research on organic byproduct formation from catalytic ozonation of real filtered water in water treatment plants was lacking. In this work, two synthesized catalysts, \u03b1-FeOOH and CeO<sub>2</sub>, were applied to catalyze ozonation of real filtered water at different ozone dosages, and the byproducts were quantified. Results showed that the \u03b1-FeOOH enhanced hydroxyl radical production, while the CeO<sub>2</sub> did not. Both catalysts further reduced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV<sub>254</sub> of the filtered water during the catalytic oxidation processes. The O<sub>3</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> improved the removal of low molecular weight compounds, especially the refractory compounds such as ketoacids and carboxylic acids, compared to ozonation alone. While the O<sub>3</sub>/\u03b1-FeOOH generated higher concentrations of carboxylic acids than that of ozonation. Thus, in light of DOC and low molecular weight compound reductions, CeO<sub>2</sub> was the superior catalyst for micropollutant removal in real filtered water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
