An exposure to 0.4 ppm O3 did not affect the microsomal xenobiotic metabolism of either lung or liver. On the other hand, 0.8 ppm O3 increased significantly the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activity and the cytochrome P-450 content of lung microsomes. The activities of lung benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase also increased significantly on d 7, and remained at a higher level by the d 14. These results show that exposures to 0.8 ppm O3 induce the xenobiotic metabolizing systems in the lung. In the liver, after the first day of exposure to 0.8 ppm O3, a significant reduction occurred in all components of the electron-transport systems examined as well as in the microsomal protein. A significant decrease was also observed in benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation, and aniline hydroxylation. The decreased activities recovered in the following period of exposure. In contrast, the p-nitroanisole N-demethylase activity was not altered during the 14-d exposures. These results suggest that some isozymes of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 are sensitive to O3 inhalation but other(s) are resistant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubota", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitroanisole O-demethylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases, O-Demethylating"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "7-Alkoxycoumarin O-Dealkylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Hydroxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrene Hydroxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.2.4", "NameOfSubstance": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "7-Alkoxycoumarin O-Dealkylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Hydroxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrene Hydroxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases, O-Demethylating"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3932670", "10.1080/15287398509530711"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
