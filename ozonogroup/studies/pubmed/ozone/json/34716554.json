Methane is emitted by energy exploration, coal mining, natural gas spills, waste, and waste dumps. Methane generated by such greenhouse gases has significantly contributed to the climate change and global warming. However, the most significant contributor to climate change and global warming is the use of fossil fuels. These fuels contribute to ozone depletion and global warming by emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The current study key objective was to determine the CO<sub>2</sub> emission effect to key fruit production in Pakistan by taking time series annual data varies from 1970 to 2019. A non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model (NARDL) was employed to check the variables linkages. The consequences of short- and long-run estimates expose that the positive and adverse shocks of citrus fruit create expressively to upsurge the CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Similarly, the positive and negative shocks of mango fruit expose an adverse interaction to CO<sub>2</sub> emission. The positive shock of apple fruit has constructive but negative shock expose and adverse linkage to CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Further, banana fruit also exposes a negative but constructive via positive shock linkage to CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Moving towards the apricot fruit production that exposed a constructive linkage via positive and negative shocks to CO<sub>2</sub> emission. The almond fruit productivity via positive and negative shocks exposed an adverse relation to carbon dioxide emission. Grape fruit via positive shock shows a construct, but negative shock exposed an adverse association to carbon emission in Pakistan. Finally the guava fruit production exposed a construct linkage to CO<sub>2</sub> emission via positive and negative shocks. Since agricultural activities and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are essential to resolving the pollution problem, a series of practicable steps must be taken by the Pakistani authorities to tackle this issue."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
