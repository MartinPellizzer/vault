The presence of some solute molecules at the surface suppresses the intensity of the OH-stretching band of water there. We used this phenomenon to study the interfacial reaction of gas-phase ozone with aqueous NaX solutions (X = Br, I) by monitoring the decrease in intensity of the OH-stretching band of water over time. UV-VIS analysis of the product solutions indicates that X(3)(-), formed from X(2) evolved in the ozonation reaction, is the species most likely responsible for the decrease in OH-stretching intensity at the surface. The dependence of the rate of OH-Raman signal loss at the water surface on the bulk halide concentration is well described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood parameters indicated that iodide has a approximately 50 times greater propensity for the surface compared to bromide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St George St., Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wren", "ForeName": "Sumi N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donaldson", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20200742", "10.1039/b922254e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
