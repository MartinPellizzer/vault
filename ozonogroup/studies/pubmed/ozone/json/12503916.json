To protect the population from such adverse health effects, early information and precautions about the high ozone level need to be ascertained. In this study, statistical characteristics of ground level ozone is analyzed according to field monitoring data in mixed residential, commercial and industrial areas, e.g., Tsuen Wan area in Hong Kong. The study deals with the characteristics of hourly and daily mean ozone levels under different climatic conditions such as temperature, solar radiation (SR), wind speed (WS), and other pollutant concentration levels. The study aims to investigate the importance of meteorological factors and their impact on relevant pollutant concentration levels from a chemical aspect. Further, reasons for the spatial and temporal variation of ozone levels are discussed. All these results will provide a physical basis for accurately predicting ozone concentration in similar research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Building and Construction, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Ave. HKSAR, Kowloon, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China. bcwzlu@cityu.edu.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Weizhen", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiekang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wenjian", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leung", "ForeName": "Andrew Y T", "Initials": "AY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuen", "ForeName": "Kwokkit", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Int", "NlmUniqueID": "7807270", "ISSNLinking": "0160-4120"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12503916", "10.1016/s0160-4120(02)00078-8", "S0160-4120(02)00078-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
