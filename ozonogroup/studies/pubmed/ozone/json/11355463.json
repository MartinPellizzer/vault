Concurrent substances in effluent gas often reduce the removal capacity of activated carbon for H2S. As a means of restoring capacity under such conditions, ozone injection into an activated carbon column was examined. When activated carbon was saturated with substances such as toluene, ethanol, n-butanol, or iso-butanol, its capacity to remove H2S decreased in proportion to the amount of the saturating substance. Under such conditions, ozone injection greatly increased capacity. Toluene, which is not easily decomposed by ozone, was displaced by ozone and by oxidized products of H2S. Ethanol, which is adsorbed in small amounts by activated carbon and easily decomposed by ozone, was removed by ozone injection. Butanols, which are also decomposed by ozone and adsorbed in large quantities by activated carbon, showed intermediate behavior between that of toluene and ethanol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Osaka City Institute of Public Health and Environmental Sciences, Osaka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuda", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukuyama", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujii", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YY9FVM7NSN", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11355463", "10.1080/10473289.2001.10464310"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
