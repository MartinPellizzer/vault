Kinetic experiments show that common ions can significantly reduce the oxidative properties of ozone, except for SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The inhibition effect of anions has been explained through the scavenging effect of free radicals and the generation of other free radicals with weaker oxidation potentials, but no research has reported on the effect of free radicals generated by anions on the degradation pathway. However, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> exerted a promoting effect through enhanced formation of \u00b7OH via the hydrolysis effect and the catalyzed decomposition of O<sub>3</sub>, respectively. According to the intermediate products identified by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis, direct oxidation of S atom, substitution of Cl atom with -OH group, and hydroxylation of the benzene ring were commonly observed. The addition of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> produced new free radicals like \u00b7NO<sub>2</sub>, \u00b7SO<sub>3</sub> and \u00b7SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, which would attack the parent compound or its primary product, thus influencing the degradation efficiency and pathways. The radicals initiated reactions and the structures of the corresponding products were further rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These findings provide new insights into the effects of common anions on ozone oxidation of organic compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
