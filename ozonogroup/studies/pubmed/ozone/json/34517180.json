The effects of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) on isoprenoid emissions have been investigated for many years, while knowledge on O<sub>3</sub> effects on floral emissions is still scarce and the relevant mechanism has not been clarified so far. We investigated the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on floral and foliar isoprenoid emissions (mainly isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and their synthase substrates from three rose varieties (CH, Rosa chinensis Jacq. var. chinensis; SA, R. hybrida 'Saiun'; MO, R. hybrida 'Monica Bellucci') at different exposure durations. Results indicated that the O<sub>3</sub>-induced stimulation after short-term exposure (35 days after the beginning of O<sub>3</sub> exposure) was significant only for sesquiterpene emissions from flowers, while long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure (90 days after the beginning of O<sub>3</sub> exposure) significantly decreased both foliar and floral monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions. In addition, the observed decline of emissions under long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure resulted from the limitation of synthase substrates, and the responses of emissions and substrates varied among varieties, with the greatest variation in the O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive variety. These findings provide important insights on plant isoprenoid emissions and species selection for landscaping, especially in areas with high O<sub>3</sub> concentration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
