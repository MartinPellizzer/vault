This study applied the WRF-Chem model to simulate the change in ozone volume fraction in this region by setting 13 precursor emission scenarios in a representative month in the summer of 2018. The results revealed that VOC-sensitivity and no-sensitivity regimes commonly occurred in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region in July, and the VOC-sensitivity regimes were mainly accumulated in the central Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, with a north-to-south zonal distribution and an area share of 15.60%-26.59%. The relative response intensity (RRI) of O<sub>3</sub> volume fraction to precursor emissions in urban areas had large spatial variability, with RRI_VOC and RRI_NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> in the ranges of 0.03-0.16 and -0.40-0.03, respectively. The higher the latitude of urban areas, the more dramatic were the RRI values, indicating a more significant regional transport influence. The lower RRI_NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> values in urban areas with high intensity of precursor emissions implied a negative dependence of RRI_NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> on local NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations; however, RRI_VOC was not significantly correlated with NO<sub>2</sub>levels and was more dependent on the relative abundance of precursors (VOCs:NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>). The ratio of RRI_VOC to RRI_NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> showed negative values in majority of the cities; therefore, collaborative VOCs emission reduction is necessary to suppress the deterioration of O<sub>3</sub> volume fraction. The absolute value of this ratio was much lower in cities with high industrialization and urbanization than in ordinary small and medium-sized cities, implying that the demand for collaborative VOCs emission reduction in these cities will be higher. However, even under 50% reduction of precursors, the improvement in O<sub>3</sub> volume fraction was limited in regional cities, and the combined prevention in neighboring cities remains important."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xing-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qi", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environment and Life, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Shui-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37827758", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202210158"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
