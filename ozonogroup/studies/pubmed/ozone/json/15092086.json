Merr. cv. Clark) grown in open-top field chambers. The chamber treatments consisted of three O3 regimes equal to charcoal filtered (CF), non-filtered (NF), and non-filtered plus 40 nl litre(-1) O3 and CO2 treatments equal to 350, 400 and 500 microl litre(-1) for a total of nine treatments. Leaf samples were taken at three different times during the growing season. Examination of growth and physiological characteristics, such as photosynthesis, stomatal resistance, and shoot weight, revealed that increasing CO2 ameliorated the deleterious effects of increased O3. Results from the initial harvest, at the pre-flowering growth stage (23 days of treatment), showed that increasing O3 at ambient CO2 caused increases in putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) of up to six-fold. These effects were lessened with increased CO2. Elevated CO2 increased polyamines in plants treated with CF air, but had no effect in the presence of ambient or enhanced O3 levels. Leaves harvested during peak flowering (37 days of treatment) showed O3-induced increases in Put and Spd at ambient CO2 concentrations. However, increased CO2 levels inhibited this response by blocking the O3-induced polyamine increase. Leaves harvested during the pod fill stage (57 days of treatment) showed no significant O3 or CO2 effects on polyamine levels. Our results demonstrate that current ambient O3 levels induce the accumulation of Put and Spd early in the growing season and that further increases in O3 could result in even greater polyamine increases. These results are consistent with a possible antiozonant function for polyamines. The ability of increased CO2 to protect soybeans from O3 damage, however, does not appear to involve polyamine accumulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Climate Stress Laboratory, USDA, ARS, Building 001, Room 206, Beltsville, Maryland 20705, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kramer", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowland", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulchi", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092086", "10.1016/0269-7491(91)90019-s", "0269-7491(91)90019-S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
