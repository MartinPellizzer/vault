The incidence of epistaxis in infants was low, increased with age, reached the peak between the ages of 4 to 5, and then gradually decreased with age. In different age groups, male patients were more than females. From 2014 to 2017 in Beijing, particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter less than 10 \u03bcm in diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) showed a downtrend, lower in summer than in the other 3 seasons. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was significantly higher in 2016 and 2017, showed an increase trend in summer. The incidence of epistaxis was negatively correlated with PM2.5, PM10, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO, which was positively correlated with O<sub>3</sub> (<i>P</i> < .05).", "Pediatric epistaxis in Beijing changes with age and has obvious seasonal variation.
