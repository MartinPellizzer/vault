Ultraviolet C (UVC) light has been suggested as a potential option for decontamination of FFRs by the Centers for Disease Control. There has been a lack of publications characterizing UVC dose distribution across FFRs.", "A UVC light box and FFR rack system was assembled using low-pressure mercury lamps peaked at 254 nm and aluminum flashing to reduce shadowing effect. Dose was characterized with the use of ultraviolet (UV) intensity labels and an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable meter. Ozone production was evaluated after extended bulb run time.", "Calibration of UV intensity labels was noted to have color-change saturation at 100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Dose measurements with the UV intensity labels on the FFR demonstrated symmetrical dose to all surfaces, but symmetry was not supported by measurements with the UVGI meter. There was substantial dose fall off on the lateral aspects of the FFR. No ozone production was noted in the UVC system.", "UV intensity labels for characterization of dose provided a false suggestion of symmetry compared with the UVGI meter. Estimates of appropriate exposure times to reach 1000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> should be significantly increased to account for geometry of FFR and lateral dose fall off."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Willamette Valley Cancer Institute and Research Center, Eugene, Oregon."}], "LastName": "Dunn", "ForeName": "Emily F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Willamette Valley Cancer Institute and Research Center, Eugene, Oregon."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Adil", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eugene, Oregon."}], "LastName": "Dunn", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Willamette Valley Cancer Institute and Research Center, Eugene, Oregon."}], "LastName": "Lacey", "ForeName": "Scott", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Rapid City, South Dakota."}], "LastName": "Pauley", "ForeName": "Ethan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Rapid City, South Dakota."}], "LastName": "Powers", "ForeName": "Colton", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Monument Health Cancer Care Institute, Rapid City, South Dakota."}], "LastName": "McKee", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Monument Health Cancer Care Institute, Rapid City, South Dakota."}], "LastName": "Petereit", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Radiat Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "101677247", "ISSNLinking": "2452-1094"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "CDC  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html Available at: Accessed October 30, 2020."}, {"Citation": "Emergency Use Authorization  FDA. https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization Available at: Accessed October 30, 2020."}, {"Citation": "Lowe J.J., Paladino K.D., Farke J.D.
