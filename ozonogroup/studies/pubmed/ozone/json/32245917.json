Although this aniline aerofloat has efficient collection properties, they are ordinarily biologically persistent chemicals in which case their residual, as well as their byproducts, pose great environmental risks to water and soils. In this study, the removal efficiency of aniline aerofloat (AAF) by a combined vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) process (VUV/O<sub>3</sub>) was evaluated. Furthermore, the impacts of pH, O<sub>3</sub>, the concentration of AAF and coexisting ions (SiO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> (Na<sup>+</sup>), SO<sub>4</sub> <sup>2-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) were systematically studied. The experiments revealed that, with an initial AAF of 15 mg/L, AAF removal >88% was feasible with a reaction time of 60 min, pH of 8 and O<sub>3</sub> of 6 g/h. The order of influence of the selected coexisting ions on the degradation of AAF by VUV/O<sub>3</sub> was Ca<sup>2+</sup> > CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2-</sup> > SiO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> (Na<sup>+</sup>) >SO<sub>4</sub> <sup>2-</sup>. Compared with VUV and O<sub>3</sub> in terms of pollutant degradation rate, VUV/O<sub>3</sub> showed a remarkable performance, followed by O<sub>3</sub> and VUV. Additionally, the degradation kinetics of AAF by the VUV/O<sub>3</sub> process agreed well with first-order elimination kinetics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Xiaoyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dachao", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Antwi", "ForeName": "Philip", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32245917", "10.2166/wst.2020.048"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
