In recent years, dose-response relationships based on the O<sub>3</sub> stomatal flux and effects on the biomass growth have been defined for several crop species. This study was aimed at developing a dual-sink big-leaf model for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to map the seasonal Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold of 6nmolm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (POD<sub>6</sub>) in a domain centered on the Lombardy region (Italy). The model runs on local measured data of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, global radiation and background O<sub>3</sub> concentration provided by regional monitoring networks, and includes parameterizations for the crop's geometry and phenology, the light penetration within the canopy, the stomatal conductance, the atmospheric turbulence, and the soil water availability for the plants. For the 2017 an average POD<sub>6</sub> of 2.03mmolm<sup>-2</sup>PLA (Projected Leaf Area) was found for the Lombardy regional domain, corresponding to an average relative yield loss of 7.5%, using the finest spatio-temporal resolution (1\u00d71km<sup>2</sup> and 1-h). An analysis of the model's response to different spatio-temporal resolutions (from 2\u00d72 to 50\u00d750km<sup>2</sup> and from 1 to 6\u00a0h) suggests that coarser resolution maps underestimated the average POD<sub>6</sub> regional value from 8to16%, and were unable to detect O<sub>3</sub> hotspots. Nevertheless, resolutions of 5\u00d75km<sup>2</sup> 1-h, and 1\u00d71km<sup>2</sup> 3-h, can still be considered reliable for the estimation of the O<sub>3</sub> risk at the regional level since they presented relatively low root mean squared error. Furthermore, although temperature was the main limiting factor for the wheat stomatal conductance in most of the domain, soil water availability emerged as the key factor for determining the spatial patterns of the POD<sub>6</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
