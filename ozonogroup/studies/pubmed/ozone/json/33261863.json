This study investigated the effectiveness of six treatment trains including single and combined disinfection processes (i.e., ozone alone, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation alone, chlorine alone, sequential ozone-UV, sequential ozone-chlorine and sequential ozone-UV-chlorine) on bacterial inactivation, as well as bulk water quality parameters such as color, turbidity, absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UV<sub>254</sub>), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescence based on samples collected from an actual water reclamation plant (WRP). For the single disinfection processes, when the ozone, UV and chlorine doses reached 5\u00a0mg/L, 15\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and 4\u00a0mg/L, respectively, the log removal of Escherichia coli (E. coli) reached 5 log. A trailing phenomenon was observed with further increases in the disinfectant dosage. Under the combined treatment scenarios, ozone pretreatment resulted in substantial removal of color, turbidity, UV<sub>254</sub>, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) and chlorine consuming organics, thus enhancing the efficiency of subsequent UV irradiation or chlorine treatments. In the sequential ozone-UV-chlorine experiments, E. coli inactivation reached 7 log with ozone, UV and available chlorine of 3\u00a0mg/L, 5 or 10\u00a0mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and 2.5\u00a0mg/L, respectively. On the basis of the results from the actual WRP, the estimated operating cost per unit for the disinfection systems is 0.065 CNY/t, which is economical for long-term operation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
