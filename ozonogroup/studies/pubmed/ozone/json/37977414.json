Extensive research has linked air pollution to various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In South Asia, air pollution is a critical issue, with a high concentration of the world's most polluted cities and widespread exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. WHO reports that outdoor and indoor air pollution together claim 7 million lives annually. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone are prominent culprits. South Asia, with 60\u00a0% of its population exposed to hazardous pollution levels, is home to 37 of the world's 40 most polluted cities. PM2.5 concentrations in South Asia often exceed WHO guidelines by up to 20 times. Air pollution in this region, driven by factors such as crop stubble burning, is a leading cause of CVD. Studies in the region have revealed a significant correlation between PM2.5 levels and CVDs, with fine particles originating from sources like industrial emissions and traffic playing a central role in cardiovascular health deterioration. Exposure to PM2.5 leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypercoagulability, increasing the risk of conditions such as ischemic heart disease and stroke. In South Asia, the burden of CVDs associated with air pollution is substantial, with millions of premature deaths attributed to outdoor and indoor air pollution. To mitigate this crisis, a multifaceted approach is essential, encompassing public awareness, air quality regulation, cleaner energy sources, and measures to reduce crop stubble burning. Additionally, further research is crucial to understanding the complex relationship between air pollution and CVDs in South Asia, as it offers avenues for prevention and control, potentially saving lives and improving public health in the region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
