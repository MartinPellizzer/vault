However, little is known about the biological toxicity of ultraviolet light against mosquitoes, which are regularly exposed to UV light. This study was planned to determine the impact of UV radiation on different aquatic stages of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefaciatus mosquitoes.", "We exposed I/II instar larvae, III/IV instar larvae and pupae of Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefaciatus mosquitoes to UV radiation of 253 nm wavelength in a closed chamber of 30\u00d730 cm. The exposure was done for different time intervals viz. 1, 2, 3, 4 minutes and so on. Development of larvae/pupae to adult stage was monitored daily and mortality, if any, was recorded.", "Development of I/II instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus to pupal stage was unsuccessful at an exposure time of one minute while only 1.7% pupation occurred in I/II instar larvae of Ae. aegypti upon similar exposure. When III/IV stage larvae were exposed to UV light, pupal development occurred only at 30seconds and one-minute exposure in An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefaciatus but in Ae. aegypti, no pupation occurred with one-minute exposure. With four-minute UV exposure of pupae, no adult emerged in Ae. aegypti; 33.3% adult emerged in An. stephensi and 66.7% adult emerged in Cx. quinquefaciatus.", "Our results show that UV radiation results in developmental arrest of Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefaciatus mosquitoes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector-8, Dwarka, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Gaurav", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector-8, Dwarka, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Ojha", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector-8, Dwarka, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Pasi", "ForeName": "Shweta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research, Sector-8, Dwarka, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Dhiman", "ForeName": "Ramesh C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Vector Borne Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101212761", "ISSNLinking": "0972-9062"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Culex quinquefasciatus"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aedes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anopheles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pupa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "48"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38174515", "10.4103/0972-9062.374043", "JVectorBorneDis_2023_60_4_382_374043"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
