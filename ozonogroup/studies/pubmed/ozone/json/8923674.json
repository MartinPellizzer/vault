The incidence of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas (combined) increased (p < 0.05) in female mice exposed to 1.0 ppm for 24 or 30 mo and marginally increased (p > 0.05) in male mice exposed to concentrations of 0.5 or 1.0 ppm. An increased incidence of nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the nasal cavities and in the centriacinar region of the lung of mice exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm for 24 and 30 mo. Nasal cavity lesions were mild and included hyaline degeneration, hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, fibrosis and suppurative inflammation of the transitional and respiratory epithelium of the lateral wall, and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium. Lung lesions included replacement of the epithelium of the alveolar ducts and adjacent alveolar septa with epithelium similar to that normally found in terminal bronchioles (metaplasia) and associated alveolar histiocytosis. Based on the results of these studies, we conclude that inhalation exposure of B6C3F1 mice to ozone for 24 or 30 mo (a) is carcinogenic in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 1.0 ppm of ozone based on an increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma and (b) results in mild, site-specific, nonneoplastic lesions in the nasal cavity and centriacinar lung of male and female mice exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm of ozone for 2 yrs, which persist with continued exposure to 30 mo. It is uncertain whether or not the marginal increase (p > 0.05) of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms in male B6C3F1 mice resulted from exposure to ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Herbert", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hailey", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grumbein", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sills", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haseman", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goehl", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roycroft", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boorman", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "7905907", "ISSNLinking": "0192-6233"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8923674", "10.1177/019262339602400502"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
