However, UGSs may also have adverse health effects by releasing biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and increasing the ambient concentrations of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and secondary organic aerosols in urban areas. BVOC emissions from UGSs might be underestimated because of the lack of consideration of the UGS land-use type in urban areas. As such, in this study, we used a newly released satellite dataset, Sentinel-2, with a resolution of 10\u00a0m, to derive the classification distribution of UGSs and predict the UGS emissions of BVOCs in Beijing in 2019. The results showed that the annual emissions of BVOCs from UGSs were approximately 2.9\u00a0Gg\u00a0C (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-3.3) in the six core districts, accounting for approximately 39% of the total UGS emissions in Beijing. Compared with the results based on Sentinel-2, the BVOC emissions might be underestimated by approximately 37% (95% CI: 11-63) using the commonly used satellite dataset. UGSs produced the highest BVOC emissions in summer (from June to August), accounting for 75.2% of the annual emissions. UGSs contributed the most to the O<sub>3</sub> formation potential in summer, accounting for 41.5% of the total. We could attribute a considerable amount of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration (27.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, 95% CI: 21.4-32.6) to the UGS BVOCs produced in the core districts of Beijing in July. The new BVOC emissions dataset based on Sentinel-2 vegetation information facilitates modeling studies on the formation of surface O<sub>3</sub> in urban areas and assessments of the impact of UGSs on public health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
