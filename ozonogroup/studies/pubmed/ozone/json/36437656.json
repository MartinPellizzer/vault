However, investigations of the spatial distribution and reaction mechanisms of these pollutants are insufficient. This study established a computational fluid dynamics-based model to evaluate ozone and byproduct distribution, considering ozone reactions in air, adsorption onto surfaces, and byproduct desorption from surfaces. The model was implemented in an authentic single-aisle aircraft cabin and validated by measurements recorded during the aircraft cruise phase. Ozone concentrations in the supply air-dominated area were approximately 50% higher than that in the passenger breathing zone, suggesting that human surfaces represent a significant ozone sink. The deposition velocity onto human bodies was 21.83\u2009m/h, surpassing 3.97\u2009m/h on other cabin interior surface areas. Our model provides a mechanistic tool to analyze ozone and byproduct concentration distributions, which would be useful for assessing passenger health risks and for developing strategies for healthier aircraft cabin environments."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
