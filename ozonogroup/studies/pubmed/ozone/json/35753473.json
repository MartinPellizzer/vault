Influenced by landfill ages and other factors, the concentration of organic matter varies. Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) is a promising technology for advanced wastewater treatment. Aiming to achieve the up-to-standard discharge of low-concentration landfill leachate (COD \u2248 108 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>) and improve the biodegradability of high-concentration landfill leachate (COD \u2248 1720 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>), the active component Fe was incorporated into a firm Ni-induced C-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-framework (<sub>Ni</sub>CAF) composite support to synthesize a Fe-<sub>Ni</sub>CAF catalyst for efficient catalytic ozonation. When the Fe-<sub>Ni</sub>CAF dosage was 4 g\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, the gas flow rate was 0.5 L\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>, and the ozone concentration was 20.0 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, the COD of low-concentration landfill leachate effluent decreased to 43 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>, and the COD removal rate constant of low-concentration landfill leachate was 154% higher than that of pure ozone. For high-concentration landfill leachate with the BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD of 0.058, the COD removal efficiency in Fe-<sub>Ni</sub>CAF/O<sub>3</sub> increased from 39% to 57% compared with ozonation, and the effluent BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD increased to 0.282. Furthermore, the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) can further enhance the treatment performance of Fe-<sub>Ni</sub>CAF/O<sub>3</sub> process and different strengthening mechanisms were revealed. The results indicated that surface hydroxyls on the Fe-<sub>Ni</sub>CAF catalyst surface were the main catalytic sites for ozone, and hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) were identified as the main reactive oxygen species for the removal of organics in landfill leachate. Adding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can promote the generation of \u2022OH for nonselective degradation of various organics, while PMS mainly enhanced the production of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> to decompose macromolecular humus. This work highlighted an efficient Fe-<sub>Ni</sub>CAF ozone catalyst and an innovative peroxide intensified HCO strategy for the advanced treatment of landfill leachate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
