Potential energy and transition dipole moment surfaces were calculated using the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles method over an extended Franck-Condon region. The first two O-O stretches and the first five HOOH torsional levels are included. This study also addresses two fundamental questions about ROOH photodissociation. The long wavelength A(1)A:B(1)B excited state preference has been measured from dynamics experiments, but a Franck-Condon overlap explanation has not been directly verified. A moderate barrier to HOOH torsional motion and excited state dynamics affect the temperature dependence in the UV spectrum. Based on these initial findings for HOOH, photodissociation of large ROOH cannot be eliminated as an important factor for ozone and particulate matter production seen in both ambient and laboratory studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drozd", "ForeName": "Greg T", "Initials": "GT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Melnichuk", "ForeName": "Ann", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donahue", "ForeName": "Neil M", "Initials": "NM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20192299", "10.1063/1.3317438"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
