It is also known that various factors may significantly influence the susceptibility of animals to the toxic effects of ozone. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that hyperthyroidism might be associated with increases in ozone-induced pulmonary toxicity. To create a hyperthyroid condition, mature male Sprague--Dawley rats were given injections of thyroxine (dose range: 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body wt daily for 7 days). Control rats received vehicle injections. The animals were then exposed to air or ozone (dose range: 0.5 to 3 ppm for 3 h). At 18 h postexposure, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cells were harvested. In hyperthyroid animals, ozone exposure was associated with three- to sixfold increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase activities and albumin levels as well as the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage above levels observed in ozone-exposed control rats. Additional results from the present study suggest that these thyroid hormone-linked effects cannot be fully explained by differences in whole-body metabolic rate or changes in the inhaled dose of ozone. These findings indicate that the risk of ozone-induced lung toxicity is substantially increased in a hyperthyroid state and suggest that the susceptibility of the lung to damage from ozone exposure may be significantly influenced by individual thyroid hormone status."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia 26505, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huffman", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Judy", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brumbaugh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frazer", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reynolds", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKinney", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldsmith", "ForeName": "W T", "Initials": "WT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q51BO43MG4", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Basal Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperthyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroxine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tidal Volume"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11350211", "10.1006/taap.2001.9174", "S0041-008X(01)99174-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
