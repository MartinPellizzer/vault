The reaction products have been analyzed by gas chromatography and mutagenicity of the products fractionated by preparative HPLC was assayed for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and YG1024 in the absence of S9 mix. 3,6-dinitrobenzo[a]pyrene and 1,3-dinitrobenzo[a]pyrene, which are strong direct-acting mutagens, largely contributed to the total direct-acting mutagenicity of the dark reaction products in NO2-air. On the other hand, both the dark reaction in the presence of O3 and the photoreaction in NO2-air resulted in the formation of much smaller amounts of nitrobenzo[a]pyrenes than that observed in the dark reaction in the absence of O3. These results show that the contribution of other direct-acting mutagens to the total direct-acting mutagenicity of the products in these reactions should be considered. Benzo[a]pyrene lactones were identified in a highly mutagenic fraction of the products of the dark reaction in the presence of O3 and photoreaction and a nitrobenzo[a]pyrene lactone was also identified in a highly mutagenic fraction of the dark reaction products in the presence of O3. Nitrated oxygenated benzo[a]pyrene derivatives such as nitrobenzo[a]pyrene lactone were considered to largely contribute to direct-acting mutagenicity of the products of the dark reaction in the presence of O3 and photoreaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Chemistry and Engineering, Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hisamatsu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inazu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aika", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11057622", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00029-1", "S0045653500000291"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
