Although in-situ measurements provide accurate information on VOCs, their spatial coverage is limited and insufficient. In this study, we provide a global perspective for identifying anthropogenic VOC emission sources through the ratio of glyoxal to formaldehyde (RGF) based on satellite observations. We assessed typical cities and polluted areas in the mid latitudes and found that some Asian cities had higher anthropogenic VOC emissions than cities in Europe and America. For heavily polluted areas, such as the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the areas dominated by anthropogenic VOCs accounted for 23 % of the total study areas. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in RGF values was observed in the YRD and western United States, corresponding to a reduction in anthropogenic VOC emissions. Furthermore, developing countries appeared to have higher anthropogenic VOC emissions than developed countries. These observations could contribute to optimising industrial structures and setting stricter pollution standards to reduce anthropogenic VOCs in developing countries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
