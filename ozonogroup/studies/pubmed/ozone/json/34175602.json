In this study, we used an observation-based decomposition model to conduct an up-to-date investigation of the effects of meteorological factors on the variations in nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China in the summer from 2013 to 2020. The variations in NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations after removing the major meteorological effects were then analyzed to improve our understanding of O<sub>3</sub> formation regimes. Ground measurements show that both NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations decreased in eastern, central, and southeastern China (e.g., NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in Wuhan reduced by 4.3 and 6.2 ppb, respectively), which was not anticipated. Analyses of meteorological effects showed that reduced wind strength, decreased temperature, and increased relative humidity significantly reduced O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in eastern and central China (e.g., by 10.5 ppb in Wuhan). After removing the major meteorological effects, the O<sub>3</sub> trends were reversed in eastern and central China (e.g., increased by 4.9 ppb in Wuhan). The contrasting trends in NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations suggest that their O<sub>3</sub> formations were sensitive to volatile organic compounds (VOC-limited regime). In southeastern China, both NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations decreased, implying that the O<sub>3</sub> formation regimes changed to mixed sensitive or nitrogen oxide-limited (NO<sub>x</sub>-limited) regimes. The meteorological effects varied by region and may play a dominant role in controlling the long-term O<sub>3</sub> variation. Our results indicate that the attribution of O<sub>3</sub> variation to emission control without accounting for meteorological effects can be misleading."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
