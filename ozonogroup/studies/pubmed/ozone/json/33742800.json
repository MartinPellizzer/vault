The source profiles of the VOCs species in foundry industries based on production processes were established for the first time in China. In addition, the emission characteristics of VOCs and the contribution of VOCs emitted by various production processes to ozone generation were also studied. The results showed that the characteristic components of the VOCs in foundry industries were predominantly aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The average concentrations were 50.9%, 20.8%, and 12.6%, respectively. In general, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, benzene, and <i>m/p</i>-xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethylene and dichloromethane; oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetone, ethyl acetate, cyclopentanone, and some alkanes, were the primary VOCs species of the foundry industries. The emission characteristics of different production processes were related to the solvents and surface treating agents used by each process. The results also demonstrated that painting was the largest contributor of VOCs concentrations among all the production processes, followed by the modeling procedure and the silica sol and pouring processes. The OFP values for the different production processes ranged from 0.29-96.09 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. Painting was the largest contributor to OFP, followed by the modeling procedure and the melting and pouring processes. Aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons were the dominant contributors to OFP, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, toluene, and <i>m/p</i>-xylene were the main active components in the foundry industry, with a total contribution to the ozone generation potential of nearly 60%. It is suggested that the painting process should be prioritized regarding control measures to reduce its emissions and impact, while the waste gas from the modeling procedure and the melting and pouring processes should be collected efficiently and treated properly before being discharged to the environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Environment Impact Assessment, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Environment Impact Assessment, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shi-Bei", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Environment Impact Assessment, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Bo", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Academy for Environmental Planning, Ji'nan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hou-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Institute of Labour Protection, Beijing 100054, China."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Mu-Shui", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Municipal Institute of Labour Protection, Beijing 100054, China."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Environment Impact Assessment, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Jia-Bao", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Environment Impact Assessment, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Tuan-Tuan", "Initials": "TT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33742800", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202008145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
