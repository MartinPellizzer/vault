Visible injury occurred within 40 h on the unifoliodate leaves and middle-aged and older trifoliolates while the younger leaves were free from toxicity symptoms. In some instances visible injury was accompanied by a decrease in chlorophyll and an increase in leaf diffusive resistance. Although nitrogen fixation was not significantly altered except at early pod formation (R3), and nitrate reductase activity was significantly reduced only if the ozone exposure occurred at the time of maximal enzyme activity (V5), nitrogen content of the leaves was reduced by ozone treatment. Shoot dry weight was not affected 40 h after ozone treatment, but root dry weight was significantly reduced. Plants grown with supplemental NO(3)(-) were more sensitive to ozone than those dependent on fixed nitrogen. At plant maturity, there was no evidence of an ozone effect on shoot, root, or seed dry weight, NO(3)(-) -grown plants showed a significant increase in growth and yield over N(2)(-) plants; but no ozone effect was observed, despite the increased foliar sensitivity. Multiple ozone exposures at growth stages V3, R1 and R3 exacerbated the effects noted with a single episode and also reduced nitrogenase activity (reflected in specific and total nodule activity) and shoot and root dry weight. At plant maturity, there was again no evidence of a significant effect of multiple ozone treatment on shoot dry weight or seed yield although root weight remained low. The results would tend to support the hypothesis that older leaves of soybean do not make a significant contribution to seed yield. Although they may be injured by ozone during the reproductive phases of growth, seed yield may not be affected if the younger O(3)-tolerant leaves remain functional."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, Cook College, Rutgers the State University, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neyra", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brennan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092333", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90104-k", "026974919090104K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
