At present, various studies have assessed the O<sub>3</sub> impacts on trees; however, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the complex ecological effects caused by multiple factors on the natural urban environment. In this paper, the interactions between O<sub>3</sub> and carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>), drought, nitrogen deposition, and warming, as well as the effects of the physiology, biochemistry, and growth of urban trees in China were reviewed. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> could alleviate the negative effects of elevated O<sub>3</sub> on the photosynthetic metabolism, antioxidant system, and growth of trees. There is a complex interaction between O<sub>3</sub> and drought, which may synergistically aggravate, alleviate, or have no effect on trees. However, there was no correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and N deposition, only a significant interaction between elevated temperatures and O<sub>3</sub>, which slowed down the adverse effects of O<sub>3</sub> on tree growth and photosynthesis. Finally, suggestions are put forward to manage and sustainable develop urban forests in China under future climate change and air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Urban Forestry, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pin", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Xiang-Yang", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rural Energy and Environment Agency, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Beijing 100125, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Lu-Lu", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34708947", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202103240"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
