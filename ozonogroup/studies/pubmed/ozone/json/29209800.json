Also, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used for analyzing the origins of air masses and their trajectory in the area. An increasing trend in aerosol concentration was observed in the most studied cities in Iran during 1979-2016. The cities in the western part of Iran had the highest annual mean of aerosol concentration. The highest aerosol optical depth (AOD) value (0.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51) was recorded in May 2012 over Ahvaz, and the lowest value (0.035\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27) was recorded in December 2013 over Tabriz. After Ahvaz, the highest AOD value was found over Tehran (annual mean 0.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20). The results show that AOD increases with increasing industrial activities, but the increased frequency of aerosols due to land degradation and desertification is more powerful in Iran. The trajectory analysis by the HYSPLIT model showed that the air masses come from Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon and passed over the Iraq and then reached to Iran during summer. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) has been analyzed for Zanjan (Aerosol Robotic Network site) during 2010-2013. The ARF at surface and top of the atmosphere was found to be ranging from -\u200979 to -\u200910W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> (average -\u200933.45\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>) and from -\u200925 to 6\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> (average -\u200912.80\u00a0W\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Meteorology, Faculty of Marine Science and Technology, Tehran North Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran. f.arkian@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Arkian", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, 32306, USA."}], "LastName": "Nicholson", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iraq"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lebanon"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Satellite Imagery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Syria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2016 Dec;189(1):6", "ArticleIdList": ["27921226"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2013 Jan;185(1):369-82", "ArticleIdList": ["22362557"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2002 Sep 12;419(6903):215-23", "ArticleIdList": ["12226676"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 2001 Dec 7;294(5549):2119-24", "ArticleIdList": ["11739947"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1992 Jan 24;255(5043):423-30", "ArticleIdList": ["17842894"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29209800", "10.1007/s10661-017-6336-1", "10.1007/s10661-017-6336-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
