The MOVI is a multi-jet impactor with 100 nozzles, allowing the collection of aerosol particles by inertial impaction on a deposition plate. The pressure drop behind the nozzles is approximately 5%, resulting in a pressure of 96kPa on the collection surface for ambient pressures of 101.3 kPa. The cut-point diameter (diameter of 50% collection efficiency) is at 0.13 microm for a sampling flow rate of 10 L min(-1). After the collection step, aerosol particles are evaporated by heating the impaction surface and transferred into the APCI-IT/MS for detection of the analytes. APCI was used in the negative ion mode to detect predominantly mono- and dicarboxylic acids, which are major oxidation products of biogenic terpenes. The MOVI-APCI-IT/MS instrument was used for the analysis of laboratory-generated secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which was generated by ozonolysis of alpha-pinene in a 100 L continuous-flow reactor under dark and dry conditions. The combination of the MOVI with an APCI-IT/MS improved the detection Limits for small dicarboxylic acids, such as pinic acid, compared to online measurements by APCI-IT/MS. The Limits of detection and quantification for pinic acid were determined by external calibration to 4.4 ng and 13.2 ng, respectively. During a field campaign in the southern Rocky Mountains (USA) in summer 2011 (BEACHON-RoMBAS), the MOVI-APCI-IT/MS was applied for the analysis of ambient organic aerosols and the quantification of individual biogenic SOA marker compounds. Based on a measurement frequency of approximately 5 h, a diurnal cycle for pinic acid in the sampled aerosol particles was found with maximum concentrations at night (median: 10.1 ngm(-3)) and minimum concentrations during the day (median: 8.2 ng m(-3)), which is likely due to the partitioning behavior of pinic acid and the changing phase state of the organic aerosol particles with changing relative humidity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Br\u00fcggemann", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vogel", "ForeName": "Alexander Lucas", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hoffmann", "ForeName": "Thorsten", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Mass Spectrom (Chichester)", "NlmUniqueID": "101124748", "ISSNLinking": "1469-0667"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24881453", "10.1255/ejms.1260"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
