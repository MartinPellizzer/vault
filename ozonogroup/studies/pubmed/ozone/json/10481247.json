An average ozone concentration of 80 nL L-1 was chosen, which often occurs close to congested areas during late spring and summer. A control soil and an ozone exposed soil were kept under same conditions such as temperature, air flow and soil humidity. The use of 14C-labelled dichlorprop allowed to examine the fate of dichlorprop and follow the degradation products in soil. Exhaustive extraction of both soils yielded several fractions containing dichlorprop residues. Half lives of dichlorprop of both treatments were 5 days. After 32 days most of the residues in soil remained in the non extractable fraction. The elevated ozone concentration showed no significant effects on the degradation behaviour of dichlorprop and its metabolites but significant differences were found for the behaviour of the nonextractable residues and of the release of carbon dioxide, which were higher for control soil in comparison to the ozone variant. These findings suggest that even moderately elevated ozone concentration in air can effect mineralisation and fixation processes of dichlorprop."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Research, Austrian Research Centers, Seibersdorf, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haberhauer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Temmel", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerzabek", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J7YV2RKO6Q", "NameOfSubstance": "dichlorprop"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10481247", "10.1016/s0045-6535(99)00047-8", "S0045653599000478"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
