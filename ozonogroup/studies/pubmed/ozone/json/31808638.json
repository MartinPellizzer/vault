Along with standard therapy, all patients received systemic and local ozone therapy. Clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics were recorded before and after treatment. In addition, hemodynamic parameters in the prostate, prostatic part of the urethra and skin projection of the prostate were evaluated.", "In patients with pyknic somatotype (from 34.12+/-0.51 cm3 to 29.08+/-0.64 cm3) the most significant reduction in prostate size during the treatment with CAPIC was observed, while the improvement of microcirculation parameters were seen in patients with asthenic somatotype. Changes in the microcirculation in the mucous membrane of the prostatic part of the urethra and skin projection of the prostate during the treatment of CAPIC are somatotype-dependent. The highest values of tissue perfusion were found in patients of the normostenic somatotype, while pyknic patients had the smallest values. Along with somatotyping, this allows to use in clinical practice the abovementioned methods for early diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of the effectiveness of CAPIC therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FGBOU VO Krasnoyarsk State Medical University named after professor V.F.
