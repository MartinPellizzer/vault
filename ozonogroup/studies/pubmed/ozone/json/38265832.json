Ozone therapy strengthens the resistance to infections by kick-starting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune modulation systems. Ozone creates a defensive response against oxidative stress in membranes and protects metabolism against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sperm membranes are one of ROS's main targets; therefore, the cells' cryopreservation process requires more defensive elements for better results. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of nano-ozone solution (NOS) on ram sperm cryopreservation and the influence of the process on various sperm parameters for post-thaw (0 hour) and postincubation (6 hours) time points. Samples were collected from six Merino rams in the breeding season by electroejaculation five times at 3-day intervals. The study was conducted by cryopreservation of the samples using a tris citric acid-egg yolk-based extender. The samples were subjected to freezing in control and NOS (0.5, 1, and 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL nano-ozone supplemented). Post-thaw motility, hypo-osmotic swelling test, acrosome (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin [PSA-FITC]), and DNA integrities (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL]) were evaluated with a phase-contrast microscope. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assessments were conducted by JC1-PI dual staining with a flow cytometer. Malondialdehyde and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by a spectrophotometer. Sperm kinematics were investigated by a computer-assisted sperm analyzer (CASA) at the post-thaw time point. Compared with the control, relatively low doses of NOS (0.5 and 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL) yielded better results in many parameters (motility, membrane and acrosomal integrities, MMP, various sperm kinematics, and GSH levels) (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05). The addition of low ozone doses to cryopreservation extenders improved the results compared with the control group at post-thaw and postincubation time points. Despite the valuable potential of nano-ozone supplementation in ram sperm cryopreservation, this subject requires further investigations with fertility trials soon."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4033-9749"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bursa Uludag University, Bursa, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Toker", "ForeName": "Mehmed Berk", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bursa \u00c7ekirge State Hospital, Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic, Bursa, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Sabanc\u0131", "ForeName": "Ahmet \u00dcmit", "Initials": "A\u00dc"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Afyon Kocatepe University, Afyon, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Avc\u0131", "ForeName": "G\u00fclcan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2975-2594"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bursa Uludag University, Bursa, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Aktar", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Afyon Kocatepe University, Afyon, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Denk", "ForeName": "Bar\u0131\u015f", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7017-5485"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bursa Uludag University, Bursa, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "Bari", "ForeName": "\u00d6zge", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bursa Uludag University, Bursa, T\u00fcrkiye."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zalp", "ForeName": "G\u00f6zde Rabia", "Initials": "GR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biopreserv Biobank", "NlmUniqueID": "101507284", "ISSNLinking": "1947-5543"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38265832", "10.1089/bio.2023.0073"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
