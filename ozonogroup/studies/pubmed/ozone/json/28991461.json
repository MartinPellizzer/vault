Volatiles emitted by a plant may trigger physiological responses in neighboring plants or adhere to their surfaces, which, in turn, may affect the responses of the neighboring plant to herbivory. These volatiles are subject to chemical reactions during transport in air currents, especially in a polluted atmosphere. We conducted a field experiment to test for the adsorption of dispenser-released myrcene on the surfaces of cabbage plants and the effects of distance from the dispenser and elevated ozone levels (1.4\u00d7 ambient) on the process. We also tested the effects of the same treatments on oviposition on cabbage plants by naturally occurring Plutella xylostella. Under low ambient ozone conditions of central Finland, there was evidence for the adsorption and re-release of myrcene by cabbage plants growing at a distance of 50 cm from myrcene dispensers. This effect was absent at elevated ozone levels. The number of eggs deposited by P. xylostella was generally lower in plots under elevated ozone compared to ambient control plots. Our results indicate that passive adsorption and re-release of a volatile monoterpene can occur in nature; however, this process is dependent upon the distance between emitter source and receiver plants as well as the concentration of atmospheric pollutants in the air. We conclude that, in the development of field-scale use of plant volatiles in modern pest control, the effects of distances and air pollution should be considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3746-8013"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland , Post Office Box 1672, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "LastName": "Mofikoya", "ForeName": "Adedayo O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland , Post Office Box 1672, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Tae Ho", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland , Post Office Box 1672, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Economic Entomology and Agricultural Zoology, Faculty of Agriculture, Menoufia University , Shebin El Kom, Menoufia Post Office Box 32514, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Raheem", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland , Post Office Box 1672, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "LastName": "Blande", "ForeName": "James D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland , Post Office Box 1672, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "LastName": "Kivim\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4", "ForeName": "Minna", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland , Post Office Box 1672, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."}], "LastName": "Holopainen", "ForeName": "Jarmo K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Finland"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Moths"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28991461", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b03251"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
