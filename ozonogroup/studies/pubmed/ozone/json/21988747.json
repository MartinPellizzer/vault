The potent odorants 2,4,6-trichloroanisole and geosmin dominated the profile of odorous compounds in wastewater effluent with concentrations up to 2 orders of magnitude above their threshold values. Additional odorous compounds (e.g., vanillin, methylnaphthalenes, 2-pyrrolidone) also were identified in wastewater effluent by gas chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry and olfactometry detection. Full-scale advanced treatment plants equipped with reverse osmosis membranes decreased odorant concentrations considerably, but several compounds were still present at concentrations above their odor thresholds after treatment. Other advanced treatment processes, including ozonation followed by biological activated carbon and UV/H(2)O(2) also removed effluent-derived odorants. However, no single treatment technology alone was able to reduce all odorant concentrations below their odor threshold values. To avoid the presence of odorous compounds in drinking water derived from wastewater effluent, it is necessary to apply multiple barriers during advanced treatment or to dilute wastewater effluent with water from other sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agus", "ForeName": "Eva", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Mong Hoo", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lifeng", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sedlak", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolidinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31O3X41254", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4,6-trichloroanisole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CHI530446X", "NameOfSubstance": "vanillin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KKL5D39EOL", "NameOfSubstance": "2-pyrrolidone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MYW912WXJ4", "NameOfSubstance": "geosmin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolidinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21988747", "10.1021/es202594z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
