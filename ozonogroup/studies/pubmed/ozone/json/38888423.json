In our study, we genotyped 1,566 Chinese pregnant women for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>LINGO2</i> gene and one SNP in the <i>GLIS3</i> gene, utilizing targeted next-generation sequencing. The impact of two interacting genes, and the interaction of genes with the environment\u2500including exposure to particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and variations in prepregnancy body mass index (BMI)\u2500on the incidence of GDM were analyzed using logistic regression. Our findings identify the variants <i>LINGO2</i> rs10968576 (<i>P</i> = 0.022, OR = 1.224) and rs1412239 (<i>P</i> = 0.018, OR = 1.231), as well as <i>GLIS3</i> rs10814916 (<i>P</i> = 0.028, OR = 1.172), as risk mutations significantly linked to increased susceptibility to GDM. Further analysis underscores the crucial role of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the development of GDM among Chinese women (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Particularly, the individuals carrying the rs10968576 G-rs1412239 G-rs10814916 C haplotype exhibit increased susceptibility to GDM during the prepregnancy period when interacting with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and BMI (<i>P</i> = 8.004 \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup>, OR = 1.206; <i>P</i> = 6.3264 \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup>, OR = 1.280; <i>P</i> = 9.928 \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup>, OR = 1.334, respectively). In conclusion, our research emphasizes the importance of the interaction between specific gene variations\u2500<i>LINGO2</i> and <i>GLIS3</i>\u2500and environmental factors in influencing GDM risk. Notably, we found significant associations between these gene variations and GDM risk across various environmental exposure periods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Special Key Laboratory of Gene Detection and Therapy of Guizhou Province, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Special Key Laboratory of Gene Detection and Therapy of Guizhou Province, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Special Key Laboratory of Gene Detection and Therapy of Guizhou Province, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Runqiu", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Reproductive and Child Health, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Peking University, Beijing 100091, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Reproductive Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Jinling Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Xuejun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Maternal & Child Health and Exposure Science of Guizhou Higher Education Institutes, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Special Key Laboratory of Gene Detection and Therapy of Guizhou Province, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1209-2104"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Special Key Laboratory of Gene Detection and Therapy of Guizhou Province, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Hongsong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes, Gestational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene-Environment Interaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Asian People"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "East Asian People"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38888423", "10.1021/acs.est.4c03221"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
