The effects of ozonation time on the oils and acids were analyzed by 1H, 13C NMR. Further, the peroxide- and acid values, the viscosity and the molar mass were determined for pure and ozonated oils. The fatty chains in both ozonated oils showed a gradual decrease of unsaturation with the gradual increase of ozonation time. Reaction products were identified according to Criegee mechanism. The major product in the early stage of the reaction was ozonide. The disappearance of unsaturation and formation of ozonide was almost equal. Ozonation increased the peroxide and acid values for both oils, the increase being higher for soybean oil. After long ozonation times higher molar mass species, as well as low molar mass species were observed. These are interpreted as oligomeric ozonides and cross-ozonides, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Equipment, Faculty of Chemical Technology, Poznan University of Technology, pl.
