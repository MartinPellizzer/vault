Here, we used data from ChinaHEART, a nationwide, population-based cohort study, combined with O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration data with high spatiotemporal resolution, to explore the independent association of exposure to O<sub>3</sub> with the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR). Among the 271 540 participants included, the crude prevalence of IR was 39.1%, while the age and sex standardized prevalence stood at 33.0%. Higher IR prevalence was observed with each increase of 10.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure, yielding adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 1.084 (95% CI: 1.079-1.089) in the one-pollutant model and 1.073 (95% CI: 1.067-1.079) in the two-pollutant model. Notably, a significant additive interaction between O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> on the prevalence of IR was observed (P for additive interaction < 0.001). Our main findings remained consistent and robust in the sensitivity analyses. Our study suggests long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was independently and positively associated with prevalence of IR. It emphasized the benefits of policy interventions to reduce O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure jointly, which could ultimately alleviate the health and economic burden related to DM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
