During ozonation, 227 transformation products (OTPs) from 39 of the spiked 51\u00a0MPs were detected after solid phase extraction by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Based on the MS/MS data, tentative molecular structures are proposed. Reaction mechanisms for the formation of a large number of OTPs are suggested by combination of the kinetics of formation and abatement and state-of-the-art knowledge on ozone and hydroxyl radical chemistry. OTPs forming as primary or higher generation products from the oxidation of MPs could be differentiated. However, some expected products from the reactions of ozone with activated aromatic compounds and olefins were not detected with the applied analytical procedure. 187 OTPs were present in the sand filtration in sufficiently high concentrations to elucidate their fate in this treatment step. 35 of these OTPs (19%) were abated in the sand filtration step, most likely due to biodegradation. Only 24 (13%) of the OTPs were abated more efficiently than the parent compounds, with a dependency on the functional group of the parent MPs and OTPs. Overall, this study provides evidence, that the common assumption that OTPs are easily abated in biological post-treatment is not generally valid. Nevertheless, it is unknown how the OTPs, which escaped detection, would have behaved in the biological post-treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
