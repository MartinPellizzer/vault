The microalga Scenedesmus quadricauda was used to increase the pH of the groundwater via natural photosynthesis. This work applied softening as a pretreatment to ozonation of hard groundwater and mainly focused on investigating the multiple effects of algal softening on the degradation of persistent micropollutants upon subsequent ozonation. The algae-induced alkaline conditions (pH > 10) were favorable to catalyze the formation of OH radicals directly from O<sub>3</sub> molecules. Moreover, algal softening removed the strong radical-scavenging carbonate species (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) to a much greater extent than that achieved by chemical softening, which was attributed to the combination of mineral carbonation and metabolic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. The fate of the natural organic matter (NOM) was characterized with spectroscopy, chromatography, and bioassay, which indicates that algal treatment decomposed the NOM to be less susceptible to attack by OH radicals. Consequently, the ozonation of alkaline groundwater achieved a better removal of the micropollutant residues in groundwater. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were used as model chemicals of persistent groundwater contaminants and were almost completely removed with an addition of 1.25 mg O<sub>3</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> (0.63 mg-O<sub>3</sub> mg-C<sup>-1</sup>)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
