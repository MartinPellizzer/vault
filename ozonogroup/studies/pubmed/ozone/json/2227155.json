To further the presently incomplete toxicological analysis of R-134a, the effects of R-134a on cell viability and functional competence of glucose metabolism were evaluated in suspension cultures of hepatocytes derived from fed or fasted rats. R-134a concentrations up to and including 75% (750,000 ppm) in the gas phase of sealed culture flasks did not produce evidence of cytolethality (LDH leakage) following 2 hr of exposure; in contrast, halothane (1,1,1-trifluoro-2-bromo-2-chloroethane) caused cell death at a gas phase concentration of only 1250 ppm. In hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. R-134a at concentrations of 12.5 to 75% increased glycolysis (production of lactate + pyruvate) in a concentration-dependent manner; no effect was observed at 5%. At 25%, R-12 and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoro-1,2-dichloroethane (R-114) were of equal potency to R-134a in stimulating glycolysis: 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoro-2-chloroethane (R-115) depressed glycolysis slightly. Halothane, at concentrations as low as 300 ppm, markedly increased rates of glycolysis. Glucose production by hepatocytes of fed rats was decreased by R-134, R-12, and R-114 only at concentrations of 25% or more. On the other hand, halothane (greater than or equal to 300 ppm) potently decreased glucose production by hepatocytes. In cells isolated from livers of fasted rats, R-134a exposure inhibited gluconeogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner although this effect was not significant until R-134a concentrations reached 12.5%. Comparative potency studies showed that R-134a, R-12, or R-114 (25% gas phase) inhibited gluconeogenesis about equally while as little as 300 ppm halothane was effective and R-115 (25%) was without effect. Considering that the threshold for alteration of the rate of glucose metabolism in this in vitro paradigm is about 12.5% R-134a, we conclude that toxicologically significant alteration of glucose-linked bioenergetics is unlikely at the levels of R-134a exposure anticipated in workplace or environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, Michigan 48090."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olson", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reidy", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Appl Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8200838", "ISSNLinking": "0272-0590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DH9E53K1Y8", "NameOfSubstance": "norflurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UQT9G45D1P", "NameOfSubstance": "Halothane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gluconeogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Halothane"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2227155", "10.1016/0272-0590(90)90054-n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
