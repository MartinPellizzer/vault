In addition, the characteristics of traffic flow and environmental information were also monitored in the tunnel. Firstly, 106 VOCs were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and then source apportionment of VOCs in the tunnel was carried out using a positive matrix factorization (PMF5.0)-chemical mass balance (CMB8.2) composite model. Finally, the ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) of vehicle exhaust sources and evaporative sources were analyzed using the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) and fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC). The results showed that <i>\u03c1</i>(VOCs) in the tunnel was (2794.5\u00b1147.4) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> during the experiment, among which halogenated hydrocarbons[(32.4\u00b12.0)%] accounted for the highest proportion, followed by aromatic hydrocarbons[(27.5\u00b10.6)%] and alkanes[(23.3\u00b10.8)%]. Source apportionment of vehicular VOCs showed that exhaust emissions (62.5%)>evaporative emissions (37.5%), whereas the contribution of OFP was that exhaust emissions (71.9%)>evaporative emissions (28.1%), and the contribution of SOAFP was that exhaust emissions (75.8%)>evaporative emissions (24.2%). The dominant components of OFP in evaporative sources were <i>m,p</i>-diethylbenzene, isoprene, and <i>trans</i>-2-pentene, whereas <i>m,p</i>-diethylbenzene, <i>m,p</i>-xylene, and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene were the dominant components of SOAFP. The major components of OFP in exhaust sources were <i>m,p</i>-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, whereas <i>m,p</i>-xylene, <i>m,p</i>-diethylbenzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were the dominant components of SOAFP. In regions where ethanol gasoline is used, special attention should be paid not only to the exhaust emissions control but also to strengthening the emissions reduction of VOCs from vehicle evaporative sources, especially the high active components such as aromatic hydrocarbons and alkenes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Ren-Cheng", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Bo-Qiang", "Initials": "BQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environment, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jing-Nan", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gasoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gasoline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35393801", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202108192"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
