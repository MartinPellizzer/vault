The catalyst, TiO(2), enhanced the production of hydroxyl radicals from ozone and raised the fraction or clofibric acid degraded by hydroxyl radicals. The rate constant for the reaction of clofibric acid and hydroxyl radicals was not affected by the presence of the catalyst. The toxicity of the oxidation products obtained during the reaction was assessed by means of Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna tests in order to evaluate the potential formation of toxic by-products. The results showed that the ozonation was enhanced by the presence of TiO(2,) the clofibric acid being removed completely after 15 min at pH 5. The evolution of dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm and the concentration of carboxylic acids monitored the degradation process. The formation of 4-chlorophenol, hydroquinone, 4-chlorocatechol, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid and three non-aromatic compounds identified as a product of the ring-opening reaction was assessed by exact mass measurements performed by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS). The bioassays showed a significant increase in toxicity during the initial stages of ozonation following a toxicity pattern closely related to the formation of ring-opening by-products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Anal\u00edtica e Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, E-28771 Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain. roberto.rosal@uah.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosal", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalo", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boltes", "ForeName": "Karina", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Let\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Pedro", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vaquero", "ForeName": "Juan J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Calvo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53PF01Q249", "NameOfSubstance": "Clofibric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clofibric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ecotoxicology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19709806", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.07.110", "S0304-3894(09)01231-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
