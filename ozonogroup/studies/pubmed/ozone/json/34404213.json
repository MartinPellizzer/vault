Herein, the RH dependence was investigated via a series of experiments for \u03b1-pinene ozonolysis in a continuously mixed flow chamber in which recurring cycles of particle growth occurred every 7 to 8 h at a given RH. In 5 h, the mean increase in the particle mode diameter was 15 nm at 0% RH and 110 nm at 75% RH. The corresponding particle growth coefficients, representing a combination of the thermodynamic driving force and the kinetic resistance to mass transfer, increased from 0.35 to 2.3 nm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The chemical composition, characterized by O:C and H:C atomic ratios of 0.52 and 1.48, respectively, and determined by mass spectrometry, did not depend on RH. The <i>Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry</i> (MOSAIC) was applied to reproduce the observed size- and RH-dependent particle growth by optimizing the diffusivities <i>D</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> within the particles of the condensing molecules. The <i>D</i><sub><i>b</i></sub> values increased from 5 \u03b1<sup>-1</sup> \u00d7 10<sup>-16</sup> at 0% RH to 2 \u03b1<sup>-1</sup> \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 75% RH for mass accommodation coefficients \u03b1 of 0.1 to 1.0, highlighting the importance of particle-phase properties in modeling the growth of atmospheric aerosol particles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1552-5139"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yiming", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9063-3260"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Jianhuai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4192-1888"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Ohno", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Zhai", "ForeName": "Jinghao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5044-8386"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yuemei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Pengfei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6215-1953"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Junfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9874-8807"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Zaveri", "ForeName": "Rahul A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8996-7554"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "Scot T", "Initials": "ST"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "27"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34404213", "10.1021/acs.est.1c01738"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
