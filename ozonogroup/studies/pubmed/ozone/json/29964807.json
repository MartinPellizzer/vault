In order to fully understand the impacts of VOCs from motor vehicles on urban air quality, the current state-of-the-art research results on source apportionment are systematically introduced. The contribution of VOCs from motor vehicles to secondary pollutants in China is further discussed. It was found that motor vehicle exhaust is the largest source of urban atmospheric VOCs, and the average contribution ratio is up to 36.8%, wherein motorcycles and light gasoline vehicles are the main emission sources. The results showed that VOCs from vehicles play an important role in O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation in urban areas, whereas with the improvement of emission standards and operating conditions, the motor vehicle emission factors and ozone formation potentials (OFPs) are obviously reduced. Moreover, the composition profile of the exhaust is mainly composed of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkenes, which contribute more to secondary pollution. This work can aid in providing data and theoretical support for the control of VOCs from motor vehicles in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tian-Zeng", "Initials": "TZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Yan-Li", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964807", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201705129"]}}]}
