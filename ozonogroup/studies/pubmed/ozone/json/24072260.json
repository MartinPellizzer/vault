Around 95 % genotoxicity and 53 % antiestrogenicity were removed from the feed water by ozonation, whereas significant reduction of acute toxicity to Daphnia magna was achieved during a 3 days vadose soil treatment. The toxicity was further removed to the same level as the local groundwater during a 20 days aquifer soil treatment. The pilot study has shown that ozonation and soil treatments can improve the quality of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents for possible groundwater recharge purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, People's Republic of China, zhangxue01@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Daphnia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Groundwater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24072260", "10.1007/s00128-013-1109-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
