However, the extent of 6\u00a0PPD-Q pollution in urban soil remains unclear. This study investigates the spatial and temporal accumulation patterns of 6\u00a0PPD-Q in greenbelt soils in Ningbo, and explores the correlation between 6\u00a0PPD-Q accumulation and soil microbial community composition and functions. Our findings indicate that 6\u00a0PPD-Q is present (ranging from 0.85 to 12.58\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) in soil samples collected from both sides of urban traffic arteries. Soil fungi exhibit higher sensitivity to 6\u00a0PPD-Q accumulation compared to bacteria, and associated fungi (Basidiomycota) may be potential biomarkers for environmental 6\u00a0PPD-Q contamination. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that the bacterial microbial network in summer exhibits greater stability and resilience in response to 6\u00a0PPD-Q inputs than in winter. However, 6\u00a0PPD-Q accumulation disrupts the network structure of fungal communities to some extent, leading to reduced diversity in fungal microbial communities. Long-term accumulation of 6\u00a0PPD-Q weakens the nitrogen and phosphorus cycling potential within urban soil, while the enhancement of carbon cycling may further promote 6\u00a0PPD-Q degradation in urban soil. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the ecological risks of 6\u00a0PPD-Q in urban soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
