To overcome this problem, this study developed a systematic molecular design, screening, and performance evaluation method to design functionally improved, environmentally friendly and synthesizable aromatic amine alternatives for the first time. Nine of 33 designed aromatic amine derivatives have improved antioxidant property (lower bond dissociation energy of N-H), and their environmental and bladder carcinogenicity impacts were evaluated through toxicokinetic model and molecular dynamics simulation. The environmental fate of the designed AAs-11-8, AAs-11-16, and AAs-12-2 after antioxidation (i.e., peroxyl radicals (ROO\u00b7), hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b7), superoxide anion radicals (O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup>) and ozonation reaction) was also analyzed. Results showed that the by-products of AAs-11-8 and AAs-12-2 have less toxicity after antioxidation. In addition, human bladder carcinogenicity of the screened alternatives was also evaluated through adverse outcome pathway. The carcinogenic mechanisms were analyzed and verified through amino acid residue distribution characteristics, 3D-QSAR and 2D-QSAR models. AAs-12-2, with high antioxidation property, low environmental impacts and carcinogenicity, was screened as the optimum alternative for 3,5-Dimethylbenzenamine. This study provided theoretical support for designing environmentally friendly and functionally improved aromatic amine alternatives from toxicity evaluation and mechanism analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
