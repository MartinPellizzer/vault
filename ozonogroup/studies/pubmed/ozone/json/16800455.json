Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) was selected as a medium for cutting SWNT due to its high solubility for ozone (O3). A mixture of 9 wt % of O3 in O2 was bubbled through a homogeneous suspension of pristine SWNT in PFPE, at room temperature. The intense disorder mode in the Raman spectra of ozonated SWNT indicates that extensive reaction with the sidewalls of SWNT occurs during ozonolysis. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of SWNT, before and after ozonolysis, provided a measure of the extent of the cutting effects. Monitoring of the evolved gases for both pristine and purified SWNT indicates CO2 was produced during the ozonolysis process with a dependence on both system pressure and temperature. During heating, FTIR analysis of gases released indicated that carbon oxygen groups on the sidewalls of SWNT are released as CO2. SWNT was found to be extensively cut after an ozone treatment with a yield of approximately 80% of the original carbon."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zheyi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ziegler", "ForeName": "Kirk J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shaver", "ForeName": "Jonah", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hauge", "ForeName": "Robert H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smalley", "ForeName": "Richard E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem B", "NlmUniqueID": "101157530", "ISSNLinking": "1520-5207"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16800455", "10.1021/jp057494c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
