Thus, this study aimed to evaluate ozone cytotoxicity in fibroblasts (L929) and keratinocytes (HaCaT) cell lines, its effects on cell migration and its antimicrobial activity. Cells were treated with ozonated phosphate-buffered saline (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL ozone), chlorhexidine 0.2% or buffered-solution, and cell viability was determined through MTT assay. The effect of ozone on cell migration was evaluated through scratch wound healing and transwell migration assays. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus were determined. Ozone showed no cytotoxicity for the cell lines, while chlorhexidine markedly reduced cell viability. Although no significant difference between control and ozone-treated cells was observed in the scratch assay, a considerable increase in fibroblasts migration was noticed on cells treated with 8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL ozonated solution. Ozone alone did not inhibit growth of microorganisms; however, its association with chlorhexidine resulted in antimicrobial activity. This study confirms the wound healing and antimicrobial potential of ozone therapy and presents the need for studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which it exerts such biological effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.
