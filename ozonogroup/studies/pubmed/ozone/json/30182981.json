The fluorescence lidar was constructed with a pulsed fourth-harmonic Nd:YAG laser at the ultraviolet wavelength of 266\u00a0nm with a repetition rate of 10\u00a0Hz. A 250\u00a0mm diameter custom telescope was used to collect optical spectra ranging from 260 to 560\u00a0nm. Fluorescence signals with wavelengths ranging from 310-440\u00a0nm were extracted, exploring a filter with a bandwidth of 130\u00a0nm. The preliminary experiments were conducted at the campus of Xi'an University of Technology, in which the fluorescence signals of atmospheric fluorescent aerosols were continuously collected from 20:00 to 23:00 CST on 13 December 2017. Based on the fluorescence lidar equation, the density of fluorescence signals was calibrated using Rayleigh-Mie scattering signals and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentration data at the ground level. Measured ranges show a strong dependence with the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations due to its absorption characteristics at ultraviolet 266\u00a0nm. Moreover, the concentration of the biogenic particles was also calculated based on the raw data of the fluorescence channel. Obtained results show that the concentration of biogenic particles in the Xi'an area varied greatly, ranging from 3456 particles\u2009\u00b7\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> to 8835 particles\u2009\u00b7\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> during winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Zhimin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Tingyao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Dengxin", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yunlong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xusheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yingying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30182981", "10.1364/AO.57.007211", "396440"]}}]}
