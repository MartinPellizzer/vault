Therefore, we thus examined the effect of O<sub>3</sub> on PROM in Xinxiang, China, using an over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive model. Several confounding factors, including meteorological factors, temporal trends, the day of the week, and public holidays, were considered in the model. We identified a total of 3255 instances of PROM from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017, and there was a significant association between the daily maximum 8-h mean concentrations (O<sub>3-8h</sub>) and PROM. Each 10\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the 3-day average concentration (lag02) of O<sub>3-8h</sub> corresponded to an increment in PROM of 5.42% (95% CI: 1.45-9.39%). Although the results of the stratified analyses were insignificant, a few trending results were observed: stronger associations between O<sub>3</sub> and PROM would occur in women with advanced age (\u226535) or during the warm season than those in younger women (<35) or during the cool season. Our study indicates that O<sub>3</sub> exposure is an important risk factor of PROM and should be considered in its prevention and control in the study area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
