Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) is involved in atmospheric ozone production while also affecting public health directly. Joint control ozone and NO<sub>2</sub> pollution would be of significance. This study quantitatively assessed the health impact attributed to ambient ozone and NO<sub>2</sub> pollution in 338 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2020. The results reveal the generally opposite trends of ozone- and NO<sub>2</sub>-related health impacts in China. From 2015-2020, respiratory and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) health impacts attributed to ozone in 338 cities increased by 65.30% and 63.98%. The NO<sub>2</sub>-attributed health impacts decreased by 24.80% and 24.62%. In 2020, the ozone- and NO<sub>2</sub>-related respiratory health impacts were 3.96 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) and 1.47 million DALYs. High health impacts are concentrated in big cities and city clusters. In 2020, the sum of ozone- and NO<sub>2</sub>-related respiratory health impacts in the top 20 cities was 0.98 million DALYs and 0.44 million DALYs, accounting for 24.70% and 30.24% of the 338 cities. The population attribution fraction analysis identified the increasing distributional consistency of ozone and NO<sub>2</sub>-related health impacts, emphasizing the necessity and possible efficiency of ozone-NO<sub>2</sub> joint control. Emission source analysis based on gridded data provided a reference for understanding health impacts and developing targeted strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
