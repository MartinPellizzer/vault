Daily average number concentrations of nucleation mode (5.6-20 nm), Aitken mode (20-100 nm), and accumulation mode (100-560 nm) particles, and total particles were 17500, 32000, 4000, and 53500 cm(-3), respectively. Average particle size distribution was monomodal with a mode diameter of about 40 nm at night and bimodal with mode diameters of about 10 and about 40 nm during the daytime. New particle formation events, which were connected to diurnal variation of nucleation mode particles, were observed in more than half of the observation days. The events often started around 10:00-11:00 Chinese Standard Time (CST) and ended up after 3-4 h. Concentrations of Aitken and accumulation mode particles increased from midnight and reached their maxima at about 10:00 CST, and then decreased and became the lowest in the afternoon. Analysis of diurnal cycles in traffic volume and meteorological parameters revealed that the accumulation of the particles in Aitken and accumulation modes in the morning was influenced by formation of an inversion and increase in vehicle emission, and dispersion of such particles in the afternoon was associated with more effective vertical mixing and higher wind speed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. shizongbo@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Zong-bo", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Ke-bin", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xue-chun", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Zhi-liang", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Fu-mo", "Initials": "FM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Young-liang", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Ying-tao", "Initials": "YT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17966849", "10.1016/s1001-0742(07)60154-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
