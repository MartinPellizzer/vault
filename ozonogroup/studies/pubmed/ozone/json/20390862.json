Oxygen flow was in situ enriched with ozone using ozoniser, with [O(3)] ranging from (0.3 - 9.8) x 10(-5) moles per liter of oxygen. The inactivation kinetics of B. subtilis followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to microbe, under excess [O(3)] conditions. The disinfection kinetics had first order dependence on ozone concentration and the overall second-order rate constant was (7.54 +/- 1.37) x 10(3) M(-1) min(-1). The effect initial temperature and pH of the system on the ozone initiated inactivation of microbe was also explored. Relative to hydroxyl radicals, molecular ozone was found more effective in microbial inactivation. Appropriate mechanism for ozone initiated inactivation is proposed. Ozone aeration significantly decreased the BOD levels of natural and B. subtilis spiked waters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Chiltern Hills, Durban, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuma", "ForeName": "Favourite N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jonnalagadda", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20390862", "10.1080/10934520903429931", "917961091"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
