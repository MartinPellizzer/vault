Here, this study investigates the association between long-term exposure to ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5), and newly diagnosed AD in Taiwan. We conducted a cohort study of 95,690 individuals' age \u2265 65 during 2001-2010. We obtained PM10 and O3 data from Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency during 2000-2010. Since PM2.5 data is only accessible entirely after 2006, we used the mean ratio between PM2.5 and PM10 during 2006-2010 (0.57) to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations from 2000 to 2005. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the associations between O3 and PM2.5 at baseline and changes of O3 and PM2.5 during the follow-up period and AD. The adjusted HR for AD was weakly associated with a raised concentration in O3 at baseline per increase of 9.63 ppb (adjusted HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.12). Further, we estimated a 211% risk of increase of AD per increase of 10.91 ppb in O3 over the follow-up period (95% CI 2.92-3.33). We found a 138% risk of increase of AD per increase of 4.34 \u03bcg/m3 in PM2.5 over the follow-up period (95% CI 2.21-2.56). These findings suggest long-term exposure to O3 and PM2.5 above the current US EPA standards are associated with increased the risk of AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan Department of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Chau-Ren", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan Department of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yu-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Bing-Fang", "Initials": "BF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Alzheimers Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9814863", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25310992", "10.3233/JAD-140855", "6P17336222133191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
