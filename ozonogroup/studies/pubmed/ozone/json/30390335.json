At present, a major focus of cerebrovascular disease research is to find a safe and effective new method to promote early functional recovery in the acute phase of cerebral infarction. Major ozonated autohemotherapy (MOAH) can maintain ATP and energy metabolism in cerebral ischemia and hypoxia, and reduce cell apoptosis. In the current study, the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the Sprague Dawley rat was established and evaluated by the clinical functional score, Hoechst staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and biochemical detection. Then, the effects of MOAH on neurological function, apoptosis, and oxygen free radical damage after acute ischemia in middle cerebral artery were evaluated. Moreover, the potential two mechanisms have been illustrated for MOAH effects. This study would lay a theoretical foundation for the application of MOAH and find an effective and early treatment method for the cerebral infarction."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xiaona", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaoyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Neurorehabilitation, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Huai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "ZhenSheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Neurorehabilitation, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "TieGen", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3849-8460"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, P.R., China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recovery of Function"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30390335", "10.1002/jcb.27978"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
