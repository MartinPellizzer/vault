Different classifications have been proposed and many therapies for the different stages have been applied. The evolution of treatments lead to an increasingly conservative approach. Numerous adjuvant treatments have been proposed in the last decade. All these complementary treatments have been proposed mainly to resolve or reduce the painful stress, predominantly caused by bacterial infection, simplifying the wound healing process and improving patients' compliance. Nowadays \"secondary\" treatments, such as autologous platelet concentrates (APCs, more specifically PRP, PRGF or PRF), hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), Auto/tetracycline fluorescence-guided bone surgery (AF-GBS/TF-GBS), medical drugs like teriparatide or the combination between pentoxifylline and tocopherol, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), laser and/or low-laser therapy and ozone therapy are more or less well documented and known considering their clinical effectiveness. The aim of the present review is the evaluation of the quantity and quality of scientific studies concerning this specific topic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas.
