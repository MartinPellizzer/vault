In this study, the removal of residual pesticides (malathion and carbosulfan) from pak choi via treatment with ozonated water was investigated. Under the optimal treatment conditions, i.e., 2.0\u00a0mg/L ozonated water and a treatment duration of 15\u00a0min, malathion and carbosulfan were degraded by 53.0 and 33.0%, respectively, without any significant changes in color. Even though there was a slight decrease in vitamin C content (~7.9\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g) following the treatments, a significant decrease in the microbial colonies on the vegetables was observed. Additionally, the pesticide degradation mechanism showed good fitting with a \"first\u00a0+\u00a0first\"-order kinetic model (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.9), and the slope (k) indicated that ozone had a more prominent degradation effect on malathion than on carbosulfan. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical basis for controlling agricultural pesticide residues in household applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
