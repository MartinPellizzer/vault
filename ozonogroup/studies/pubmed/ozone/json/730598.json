In experiment 1, 10 subjects who exercised on a bicycle ergometer at 50% of maximal oxygen consumption while being exposed to 0.3 ppm ozone had increased lung residual volume and decreased vital capacity, maximal midexpiratory flow rate, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. In experiment 2, breath collected into a spirometer filled with hydrocarbon-scrubbed air showed increased pentane from the stress of exercise but no effect of ozone. During rest and exercise in experiment 3, two of six subjects had higher pentane levels than the other subjects. Following daily supplementation with 1,200 IU dl-alpha-tocopherol for 2 wk, the mean production of pentane during rest and exercise was significantly lowered, and there was no difference in pentane production among the subjects. It was concluded that lipid peroxidation occurs during exercise and that it is attenuated by vitamin E."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dillard", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Litov", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savin", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dumelin", "ForeName": "E E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tappel", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801242", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residual Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vital Capacity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["730598", "10.1152/jappl.1978.45.6.927"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
