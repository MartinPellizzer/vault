The review was performed according to the list of PRISMA SrC recommendations and the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis for Scoping Reviews. The review was registered in Open Science Framework (OSF). EMBASE (Ovid), Lilacs, LIVIVO, MEDLINE (PubMed), SciELO, Scopus and Web of Science were primary sources, and \"gray literature\" was searched in OpenGray and OpenThesis. A study was included if it reported primary data on the effect of ozone gas application for vehicle-borne and airborne virus inactivation. No language or publication date restriction was applied. The search was conduct on July 1, 2020. A total of 16,120 studies were screened, and after exclusion of noneligible studies, fifteen studies fulfilled all selection criteria. Application of ozone gas varied in terms of concentration, ozone exposure period and the devices used to generate ozone gas. Twelve studies showed positive results for inactivation of different virus types, including bacteriophages, SARS-CoV-2 surrogates and other vehicle-borne viruses. Most of the studies were classified as unclear regarding sponsorship status. Although most of the population has not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19, disinfection of environments, surfaces, and objects is an essential prevention strategy to control the spread of this disease. The results of this Scoping Review demonstrate that ozone gas is promising for viral disinfection of surfaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2919-2910"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, School of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology and Implantology, Uberl\u00e2ndia, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Irie", "ForeName": "Milena Suemi", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7887-8591"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri - UFVJM, School of Dentistry, Department of Dentistry, Dental Prosthesis, Diamantina, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dietrich", "ForeName": "Lia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3505-5258"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, School of Dentistry, Department of Endodontics, Uberl\u00e2ndia, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Gabriela Leite de", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4492-8957"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, School of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology and Implantology, Uberl\u00e2ndia, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Priscilla Barbosa Ferreira", "Initials": "PBF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5653-8403"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, School of Dentistry, Department of Endodontics, Uberl\u00e2ndia, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Moura", "ForeName": "Camilla Christian Gomes", "Initials": "CCG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9358-1339"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, Department of Operative Dentistry and Dental Materials, Uberl\u00e2ndia, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Gisele Rodrigues da", "Initials": "GRD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7599-0120"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia - UFU, School of Dentistry, Department of Community and Preventive Dentistry, Uberl\u00e2ndia, MG, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Paranhos", "ForeName": "Luiz Renato", "Initials": "LR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz Oral Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101307187", "ISSNLinking": "1806-8324"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35081224", "10.1590/1807-3107bor-2022.vol36.0006", "S1806-83242022000100400"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
