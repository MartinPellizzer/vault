Inhalation of urban particulate matter and ozone by rats has been shown to result in increased synthesis of the potent vasoactive peptide endothelin (ET)-1 in the lungs, with spillover into the circulation. In the present work, we have analyzed the interrelationships between responses of the three major endothelin isoforms, ET-1[1-21], ET-2[1-21], and ET-3[1-21], to inhaled pollutants at the peptide and gene expression levels. Fisher-344 rats were exposed for 4 hrs by nose-only route to clean air, urban particles EHC-93 (0, 50 mg/m3), ozone (0, 0.8 ppm), or ozone and particles together. Circulating levels of both the ET-1 [1-21] and ET-3[1-21] peptides were increased immediately after exposure to particulate matter or ozone. While expression of preproET-1 mRNA in the lungs increased, expression of preproET-3 mRNA decreased immediately after exposure. PreproET-2 mRNA was not detected in the lungs, and exposure to either pollutant did not affect plasma ET-2 levels. Co-exposure to ozone and particles, while altering lung preproET-1 and preproET-3 mRNA levels in a fashion similar to ozone alone, did not cause changes in the circulating levels of the two corresponding peptides. Thus, de novo synthesis of ET-3 in the lungs is not responsible for the increase of circulating plasma ET-3 after inhalation of pollutants, which implies regulation of preproET-3 at a remote site and, hence, systemic impacts of the pollutants. Upregulation of preproET-1 coupled with down-regulation of preproET-3 in the lungs of animals exposed to air pollutants implies a mismatch of local ET-1/ET(A) receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and ET-3/ET(B) receptor-mediated vasodilation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomson", "ForeName": "Errol", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumarathasan", "ForeName": "Prem", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vincent", "ForeName": "Renaud", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Exp Biol Med (Maywood)", "NlmUniqueID": "100973463", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3699"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endothelin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endothelins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "147994-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "preproendothelin-3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16741034", "231/6/979"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
