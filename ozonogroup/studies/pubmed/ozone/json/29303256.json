Although air trapped in polar ice cores can provide direct information about N<sub>2</sub>O evolution, analytical precision was not previously sufficient for high temporal resolution studies. In this work, we present a highly improved analytical technique with which to study N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations in ancient-air-trapped ice cores. We adopt a melt-refreezing method to extract air and use a gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) to determine N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations. The GC conditions are optimized to improve the sensitivity for detecting N<sub>2</sub>O. Retrapped N<sub>2</sub>O in ice during the extraction procedure is precisely analyzed and corrected. We confirmed our results using data from the Styx Glacier ice core in Antarctica by comparing them with the results of a dry-extraction method. The precision estimated from the pooled standard deviation of replicated measurements of the Styx ice core was 1.5 ppb for \u223c20 g of ice, a smaller sample of ice than was used in previous studies, showing a significant improvement in precision. Our preliminary results from the Styx Glacier ice core samples have the potential to define small N<sub>2</sub>O variations (a few parts per billion) at centennial time scales."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University , 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Yeongjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University , 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-2280-2832"], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Jinho", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Seoul National University , 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ji-Woong", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "STYX protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K50XQU1029", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice Cover"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29303256", "10.1021/acs.est.7b05250"]}}]}
