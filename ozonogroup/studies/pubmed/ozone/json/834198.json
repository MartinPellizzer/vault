Data from 4 of the subjects were excluded from the analysis because of missing data points. The blood samples were cultured for 48 h, slides made and stained with a uniform Giemsa stain, and 100 metaphase spreads per subject per treatment scored for chromosome aberrations. Cells with suspected aberrations were photographed, destained, restained with a banding procedure and rephotographed to identify the specific chromosomes and regions involved. Pre-exposure, immediate post-exposure, 3 days post-exposure, 2 weeks post-exposure and 4 weeks post-exposure means for the percentage of cells with 46 chromosomes were 93.0, 93.6, 91.7, 94.5 and 94.2, respectively; in the same order, the mean number of cells with chromatid and/or chromosome breaks per order, the mean number of cells with chromatid and/or chromosome breaks per 100 cells was 0.96, 0.85, 1.00, 0.88 and 0.81 respectively, and for chromatid and/or chromosome gaps per 100 cells: 1.35, 0.96, 1.35, 0.81 and 0.77, respectively. The means for each of these parameters as well as the mean frequencies of complex aberrations are not statistically significantly different between blood sampling times. The distribution of aberrations by chromosome and light and dark bands is not significantly influenced by ozone exposure. These data indicate no apparent detectable human cytogenetic effect due to exposure to ozone under the conditions of this experiment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKenzie", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Knelson", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rummo", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "House", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aneuploidy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["834198", "10.1016/0027-5107(77)90193-2", "0027-5107(77)90193-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
