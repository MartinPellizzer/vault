We developed a prototype CO<sub>2</sub> liquid-to-air GSHP to investigate its performance potential in residential applications. Further, we developed a detailed model of the system that simulates both cooling and heating operation; the model is the primary focus of this report. The model simulates both subcritical and transcritical operation since the system regularly operates near and above the critical temperature of CO<sub>2</sub> (30.98 \u00b0C) during heating and cooling operation. The model considered both the refrigerant-side thermodynamic and transport processes in the cycle, as well as the air-side heat transfer and moisture removal. We performed cooling tests for the prototype CO<sub>2</sub> GSHP that included those from the International Standards Organization (ISO) 13256-1 standard for liquid-to-air heat pumps, as well as extended tests at additional entering liquid temperatures (ELTs). The model predicted the measurements within 0.5 % to 6.7 % for COP, 1.0 % to 3.6 % for total capacity, and 3.3 % to 4.9 % for sensible capacity. We compared the measured cooling performance to published performance data for a commercially-available R410A GSHP and found that for ELTs below 20 \u00b0C, the CO<sub>2</sub> GSHP has a higher cooling COP and total capacity than the R410A GSHP. At the 'standard' cooling rating condition (ELT 25 \u00b0C), the CO<sub>2</sub> GSHP COP was 4.14 and the R410A GSHP COP was 4.43. At 'part-load' conditions (ELT 20 \u00b0C) the CO<sub>2</sub> GSHP COP was 4.92 and the R410A GSHP COP was 4.99. In the future, the model can be used to investigate methods to improve the CO<sub>2</sub> GSHP performance to meet or exceed that of the R410A system over a wider range of ELTs; possible studies include replacing the electronic expansion valve (EEV) with an ejector, optimizing the charge, and optimizing the heat exchanger geometry and circuiting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Standards and Technology, Engineering Laboratory, Energy and Environment Division, HVAC&R Equipment Performance Group, USA."}], "LastName": "Skye", "ForeName": "Harrison M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northland Numerics, USA."}], "LastName": "Dyreby", "ForeName": "John J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "9999-NIST", "Acronym": "ImNIST", "Agency": "Intramural NIST DOC", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Energy Convers Manag", "NlmUniqueID": "101598654", "ISSNLinking": "0196-8904"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Self SJ, Reddy BV, Rosen MA (2013).
