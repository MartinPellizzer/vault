No significant effects on affinity were found, as Kd control values for receptors derived from rat bone marrow averaged 57 (+/- 28) pM while experimental (hypoxic) values averaged 89 (+/- 55) pM. Kd control values in rat lung were found to average 142 (+/- 22) pM while average values derived from experimental protocols with ozone and methimazole were 267 (+/- 44) pM and 161 (+/- 35) pM respectively. Finally, Kd control values for receptors derived from cultured MEL cells averaged 19 (+/- 2.6) pM while experimental values during exposure to DMSO or IGF1 were 23 (+/- 3.6) pM and 26 (+/- 11) pM respectively. In contrast, binding capacity (expressed as fmoles of hormone bound per unit protein of solubilized receptor) was markedly perturbed in several tissues by various agents: ozone effects on lung were shown by an average control value of 3.3 (+/- 0.4) as opposed to an experimental average of 28 (+/- 1.9); and hypoxia effects on erythroid tissue were displayed by an average control value of 0.7 (+/- 0.07) as opposed to the experimental figure of 1.8 (+/- 0.03). In cultured MEL cells, binding capacity was seen to be increased from control values of 388 (+/- 15) sites/cell to 1243 (+/- 142) sites/cell after DMSO exposure and 2002 (+/- 10) sites/cell after IGF1 exposure. Parallel experiments done with receptors derived from rat liver yielded values similar to those reported by other investigators and were unaffected by the experimental agents. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that some thyroid target tissues may vary their response to homeostatic concentrations of hormone by modulating their production of receptors as a consequence of exposure to non-thyroidal stimuli."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Pella 50219."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "ErkenBrack", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clemons", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL 22469", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Recept Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8008358", "ISSNLinking": "0197-5110"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Thyroid Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11096-26-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Erythropoietin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Erythropoietin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Thyroid Hormone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3193404", "10.3109/10799898809049029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
