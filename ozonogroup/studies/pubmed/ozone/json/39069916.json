Pyrrole (Py) molecules undergo polymerization, resulting in the formation of extended chains of PPy that graft onto the surface of IGZO nanoparticles. This interaction effectively diminishes oxygen vacancies on the IGZO surface, thereby promoting the crystallization of the IGZO (1114) facets. The resultant structure exhibits promising potential for achieving high-performance wideband semiconductor gas sensors. The IGZO/PPy device forms a Straddling Gap heterojunction, facilitating enhanced electron transfer between IGZO and ozone molecules. Notably, the adsorption and desorption of ozone gas occur efficiently at a low temperature of approximately 25 \u00b0C, obviating the need for additional energy typically associated with wide bandgap semiconductor materials. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations attribute this efficiency to the enhanced number of active sites for ozone adsorption, facilitated by hydrogen bonds. The substantial conductivity of PPy, combined with its planar ring structure, induces positively charged polarization on the IGZO side upon ozone adsorption. The resultant device exhibits exceptional sensitivity, boasting a 4-fold improvement compared to sensors reliant solely on IGZO. Additionally, the response time is significantly reduced by a factor of 10, underscoring the practical viability and enhanced performance of the IGZO/PPy sensor field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5185-0222"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Zu-Yin", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Nanoscience, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wan-Yu", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2894-6119"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Utkarsh", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kuen-Lin", "Initials": "KL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Te-Hsien", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6591-8873"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Changhua 515, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jau-Han", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Nanoscience, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chiu-Hsien", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39069916", "10.1021/acsami.4c07392"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
