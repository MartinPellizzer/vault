Herein, five groups of zinc oxide nanotube arrays with pore sizes from 168 to 10 nm were produced as mini-column catalyst reactors (MCRs) for internal catalytic ozonation, whose performance was comparatively studied on the kinetics of ozone transfer, consumption, and radical probe interaction. Using an R<sub>CT</sub> value describing HO\u2022 exposure, all the MCRs with sufficient ozone transfer featured an R<sub>CT</sub> level of at least 3.2 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>, which is substantially higher than most values in referenced works (10<sup>-9</sup>\u223c10<sup>-6</sup>) and that for microscale reactors in our work (\u223c10<sup>-8</sup>). Furthermore, the HO\u2022 exposure dramatically increased with diminishing pore size, causing an elevated R<sub>CT</sub> up to 8.0 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> for the smallest MCR with 10 nm pore. The interphase formed in this flow-through system might have enriched HO\u2022 radicals produced via surface, and for a smaller MCR, the effect would be greater with a more confined microfluidic region. Investigations on electron paramagnetic resonance and the treatment of ozone-recalcitrant organics corroborated the nanoscale effect of MCR on augmentation of HO\u2022 exposure. This study offers a new way to design nanotube reactors for internal HO\u2022-based heterogeneous catalysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8663-8616"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (MOE), School of Environmental Science and Technology , Dalian University of Technology , Linggong Road 2 , Dalian 116024 , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3085-0789"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (MOE), School of Environmental Science and Technology , Dalian University of Technology , Linggong Road 2 , Dalian 116024 , China."}], "LastName": "Quan", "ForeName": "Xie", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (MOE), School of Environmental Science and Technology , Dalian University of Technology , Linggong Road 2 , Dalian 116024 , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SOI2LOH54Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zinc Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30027737", "10.1021/acs.est.8b02103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
