Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can easily react with atmospheric radicals to form ozone. In-field measurement of VOCs may help in estimating the local VOC photochemical pollution level.", "This study examined the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of VOCs during winter at three typical sites of varying classification in China; industrial (Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development District (GETDD)), urban (Guangzhou higher education mega center (HEMC)), and rural (Pingyuan county (PYC)), using Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS).", "The concentrations of total VOCs (TVOCs) at the GETDD, HEMC and PYC sites were 352.5, 129.2 and 75.1\u00a0ppb, respectively. The dominant category of VOCs is nitrogen-containing VOCs (NVOCs, accounting for 43.3% of TVOCs) at GETDD, of which C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N (m/z<sup>+</sup>\u00a0=\u00a074.10, butyl amine) was the predominant chemical species (80.5%). In contrast, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the most abundant at HEMC and PYC, accounting for 60.2% and 64.1% of the total VOCs, respectively; here, CH<sub>4</sub>O (m/z<sup>+</sup>\u00a0=\u00a033.026, methanol) was the major compound, accounting for 40.5% of the VOCs at HEMC and 50.9% at PYC. The ratios of toluene to benzene (T/B) were calculated for different measured sites, as the ratios of T/B can reveal source resolution of aromatic VOCs. The average contributions to total ozone formation potentials (OFP) of the total measured VOCs in each area were 604.9, 315.9 and 111.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> at GETDD, HEMC and PYC, respectively; the highest OFP contributors of the identified VOCs were aliphatic hydrocarbons (AlHs) at GETDD, aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) at HEMC, and OVOCs at PYC.", "OFP assessment indicated that the photochemical pollution caused by VOCs at GETDD was serious, and was also significant in the HEMC region. The dominant VOC OFP groups (AlHs and AHs) should be prioritized for control, in order to help reduce these effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
