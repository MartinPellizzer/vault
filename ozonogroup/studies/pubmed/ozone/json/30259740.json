We conducted a longitudinal panel study among 43 college students in Shanghai to explore the effects of personal ozone exposure on blood pressure (BP), vascular endothelial function, and the potential molecular mechanisms. We measured real-time personal ozone exposure levels, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), and locus-specific DNA methylation of ACE and EDN1 (coding ET-1). We used an untargeted metabolomic approach to explore potentially important metabolites. We applied linear mixed-effect models to examine the effects of ozone on the above biomarkers. An increase in 2 h-average ozone exposure was significantly associated with elevated levels of BP, ACE, and ET-1. ACE and EDN1 methylation decreased with ozone exposure, but the magnitude differed by genomic loci. Metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in serum lipid metabolites following ozone exposure that are involved in maintaining vascular endothelial function. Our findings suggested that acute exposure to ambient ozone can elevate serum levels of ACE and ET-1, decrease their DNA methylation, and alter the lipid metabolism, which may be partly responsible for the effects of ozone on BP and vascular endothelial function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of
