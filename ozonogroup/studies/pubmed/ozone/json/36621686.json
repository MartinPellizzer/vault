However, whether such heterocyclization reaction happens on other alkanes and what is the contributing mechanism of ROS to the heterocyclic compound formation are still unclear. In present study, photocatalytic ozonation of three n-hexane's isomers (i.e. 2-methypentane, 3-methylpentane and 2,3-dimethylbutane) on Cu<sub>2</sub>O-CuO/TiO<sub>2</sub>-foam ceramic was investigated. Within reaction period, 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane not only showed higher average degradation efficiency than 2,3-dimethylbutane, but also separately converted to interfacial heterocyclic compounds of 5,5-dimethyldihydro-2(3H)-furanone and 4,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone. Enough reaction time, optimum experimental atmosphere and shorter light wavelength benefited the formation of heterocyclization products. None of O<sub>3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, electron and hole directly contributed to the heterocyclic compound formation. While <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> dominated the production of the heterocyclic compound under the dry reaction atmosphere and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH showed more important role than <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> in the heterocyclic compound formation under the moist reaction atmosphere. Theoretical calculation confirmed that <sup>\u2022</sup>OH or <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> induced heterocyclization reaction of alkane was exothermic, while the former reaction released 0.47\u00a0eV higher energy than the later reaction. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of contributing roles of ROS in heterocyclization reaction of alkanes, and are helpful for effective elimination of industrial alkanes by advanced oxidation methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
