Eppendorf tubes were connected to the coronal portion of the teeth. Urethane hoses were attached to the tubes and to the entrance of a peristaltic pump. The exit of the apparatus corresponded to the apical portion of the root canals. The test irrigating solutions were ozonated water, gaseous ozone, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% chlorhexidine that circulated at a constant flow of 50 mL min(-1) for 20 min. Samples from the root canals were collected and immersed in 7 mL Letheen Broth (LB), followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was analysed by turbidity of the culture medium and subculture on a specific nutrient broth. A 0.1 mL inoculum obtained from LB was transferred to 7 mL of brain heart infusion and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was checked by turbidity of the culture medium carried out in triplicate.", "No solution used as an irrigant over a 20-min contact time demonstrated an antimicrobial effect against E. faecalis.", "The irrigation of infected human root canals with ozonated water, 2.5% NaOCl, 2% chlorhexidine and the application of gaseous ozone for 20 min was not sufficient to inactivate E. faecalis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s, Goi\u00e2nia, GO, Brazil. estrela3@terra.com.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Estrela", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Estrela", "ForeName": "C R A", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Decurcio", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hollanda", "ForeName": "A C B", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int Endod J", "NlmUniqueID": "8004996", "ISSNLinking": "0143-2885"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nephelometry and Turbidimetry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17229112", "10.1111/j.1365-2591.2006.01185.x", "IEJ1185"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
