This is a systematic review to summarize the quantitative concentration-response relationships by screening and analyzing the polled effects of population-based epidemiological studies. After collecting literature published between 1980 and 2019, a total of 19 health outcomes in 101 studies with 182 health risk estimates were recruited. By meta-analysis, the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and Egger's test for publication bias, the robust and reliable effects were found for SO<sub>2</sub> (per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> ) with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (pooled relative risks [RRs] 1.016, 95% CI: 1.012-1.021) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (RR 1.012, 95%CI: 007-1.018), respectively. NO<sub>2</sub> (per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> ) had the pooled RRs for childhood asthma, preterm birth, lung cancer, diabetes, and COPD by 1.134 (1.084-1.186), 1.079 (1.007-1.157), 1.055 (1.010-1.101), 1.019 (1.009-1.029), and 1.016 (1.012-1.120), respectively. CO (per 1\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup> ) was significantly associated with Parkinson's disease (RR 1.574, 95% CI: 1.069-2.317) and CVD (RR 1.024, 95% CI: 1.011-1.038).
