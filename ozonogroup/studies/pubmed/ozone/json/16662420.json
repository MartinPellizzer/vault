An 0(3)-sensitive snap bean cultivar (Phaseolus vulgaris L. ;Bush Blue Lake 290') was systemically treated with EDU (0, 25, 50, and 100 milligrams per 15-centimeter diameter pot) to determine if EDU-induced or activated protective oxyradical and peroxyl scavenging enzymes. EDU-enhanced tolerance to O(3) injury always correlated with increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities in the leaves. Peroxidase levels correlated more closely with foliar injury. Greater SOD levels in young leves compared to older leaves were associated with lower ozone sensitivities in these tissues.Polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis separations and specific determinations of SOD activity showed that EDU-treated plants possessed markedly greater SOD activity than non-treated plants. Tolerant plant tissues may have enhanced enzyme scavenging capabilities for the protection against toxic oxyradicals. Experimental confirmation for the oxyradical theory for O(3) phytotoxicity and SOD involvement in the detoxification process are presented."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Stress Laboratory, Plant Physiology Institute, Science and Education Administration, Agricultural Research, Beltsville, Maryland 20705."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bennett", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1969 Nov 25;244(22):6049-55", "ArticleIdList": ["5389100"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1971 Nov;44(1):276-87", "ArticleIdList": ["4943714"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Feb;67(2):347-50", "ArticleIdList": ["16661672"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1976 Nov;58(5):644-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16659735"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1978 Sep 8;201(4359):875-80", "ArticleIdList": ["210504"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1980 May;201(2):369-74", "ArticleIdList": ["7396513"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16662420", "PMC426435", "10.1104/pp.69.6.1444"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
