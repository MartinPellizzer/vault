Airway responsiveness, measured as acetylcholine concentration needed to increase baseline airway resistance (RL) by 250% (PC250), increased 1 h after exposure to ozone at 3 ppm for 3 h (-log PC250 from 3.88 +/- 0.17 to 4.78 +/- 0.18; P < 0.05), but returned to baseline at 8 h. An increase in neutrophil numbers was found at 8 h in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). After O3 exposure on 4 successive days, baseline RL increased and airway responsiveness decreased at 1, 8 and 72 h (-log PC250 = 2.88 +/- 0.17, 2.83 +/- 0.10 and 3.12 +/- 0.08, respectively, compared to control value of 3.48 +/- 0.05). Repeated exposures to O3 also increased neutrophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in bronchial submucosa. Thus, single exposure to O3 caused a rapid and transient increase in airway responsiveness, while multiple exposures induced a rapid but prolonged decrease in airway responsiveness associated with persistent bronchoconstriction. Both single and multiple exposures induced airway inflammation as evidenced by an increase in neutrophil influx. These studies demonstrated a dissociation between ozone-induced changes in airway responsiveness and neutrophil influx, and indicate that multiple exposures to O3 induce persistent bronchoconstriction with airway hyporesponsiveness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial School of Medicine, London, U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Respir Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8908438", "ISSNLinking": "0954-6111"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9068816", "10.1016/s0954-6111(97)90136-0", "S0954-6111(97)90136-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
