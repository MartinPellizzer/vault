In this work, three kinds of facet-engineered monoclinic NiO catalysts were successfully prepared and utilized for catalytic toluene ozonation (CTO). Density functional theory calculations revealed that Ni vacancies were more likely to form preferentially than O vacancies on the (110), (100), and (111) facets of monoclinic NiO due to the stronger Ni-vacancy formation ability, further affecting O-vacancy formation. Extensive characterizations demonstrated that Ni vacancies significantly promoted the formation of O vacancies and thus reactive oxygen species in the (111) facet of monoclinic NiO, among the three facets. The performance evaluation showed that the monoclinic NiO catalyst with a dominant (111) facet exhibits excellent performance for CTO, achieving a toluene conversion of \u223c100% at 30 \u00b0C after reaction for 120 min under 30 ppm toluene, 210 ppm ozone, 45% relative humidity, and a space velocity of 120\u202f000 h<sup>-1</sup>. This outperformed the previously reported noble/non-noble metal oxide catalysts used for CTO at room temperature. This study provided novel insight into the development of highly efficient facet-engineered catalysts for the elimination of catalytic VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9881-9687"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Xinxin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Chenguang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9259-7179"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Haibao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3834-8929"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tianle", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5234-3775"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5611-3093"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Space and Environment, Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-Inspired Energy Materials and Devices, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Haining", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4166-4615"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Fangxia", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8754-5083"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37936384", "10.1021/acs.est.3c06194"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
