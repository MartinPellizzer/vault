Cavities were restored with a light-cured composite material (Tetric Ceram, shade A2, Ivoclar Vivadent) using a self-etching adhesive system (Syntac Clasic, Ivoclar Vivadent) with H3PO4 conditioning of the enamel. Each group was evaluated in respect to marginal adaptation before and after mechanical and thermal loading under simulated dentinal fluid.", "Even if loading significantly influenced marginal quality in all groups (paired t-test, p < 0.05), the percentages of \"continuous margin\" of all groups in enamel ranged between 93.2% and 92.3% before and 84.1% and 76.9% after loading and were not significantly different (ANOVA and Scheffe's post-hoc test, p > 0.05). Continuous margin in dentin ranged from 98.9% to 94.2% before and from 95.9% to 76.4% after loading, and significant differences were observed between groups treated with ozone vs control before and after loading and CoJet vs control group after loading (ANOVA and Scheffe's post-hoc test, p < 0.05).", "Surface treatment with ozone and silica coating may significantly decrease marginal quality in dentin without negatively influencing marginal quality in enamel."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cariology and Endodontology, School of Dentistry, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onisor", "ForeName": "Ioana", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouillaguet", "ForeName": "Serge", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krejci", "ForeName": "Ivo", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Adhes Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "100888552", "ISSNLinking": "1461-5185"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Composite Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resin Cements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Syntac dentine adhesive"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetric ceram"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acid Etching, Dental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Composite Resins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Cavity Preparation"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Enamel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Marginal Adaptation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Restoration, Permanent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Stress Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Dentin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molar, Third"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resin Cements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Mechanical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17655069", "842665"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
