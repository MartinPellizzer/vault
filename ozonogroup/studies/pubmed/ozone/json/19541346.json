Measurements of aerosol size distributions and number concentrations for particles in the size range of 10-500 nm have been made since December 2001 to date in Rochester. The measurements are being made using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) consisting of a DMA and a CPC (TSI models 3071 and 3010, respectively). From December 2001 to March 2004, particle measurements were made at the NYS DEC site in downtown Rochester, but it was moved to the eastside of Rochester in May 2004. Each measurement period was divided into three seasons i.e., winter (December, January, and February), summer (June, July, and August), and the transitional periods (March, April, May, September, October, and November) so as to avoid experimental uncertainty resulting from too large season-to-season variability in ambient temperature and solar photon intensity that would lead to unstable/non-stationary size distributions. Therefore, the seasons were analyzed independently for possible sources. Ten sources were identified at both sites and these include traffic, nucleation, residential/commercial heating, industrial emissions, secondary nitrate, ozone- rich secondary aerosol, secondary sulfate, regionally transported aerosol, and a mixed source of nucleation and traffic. These results show that the measured total outdoor particle number concentrations in Rochester generally vary with similar temporal patterns, suggesting that the central monitoring site data can be used to estimate outdoor exposure in other parts of the city."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Air Resources Engineering and Science, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY 13699-5708, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasumba", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopke", "ForeName": "Philip K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chalupa", "ForeName": "David C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Utell", "ForeName": "Mark J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19541346", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.05.040", "S0048-9697(09)00509-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
