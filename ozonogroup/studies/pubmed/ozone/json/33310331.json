The recovery rate of manganese can be approximately 100% while the recovery efficiency of cobalt, nickel, and lithium is less than 15%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Compared with pure \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2-MnO<sub>2</sub>, transition metal-doped \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2-MnO<sub>2</sub> exhibit better catalytic performance in toluene and formaldehyde removal attributed to their lower crystallinity, more defects, larger specific surface area, more oxygen vacancies, and better low-temperature redox ability. Besides, the introduction of the appropriate proportion of cobalt or nickel into MnO<sub>2</sub> can significantly improve its catalytic activity. Furthermore, the TD/GC-MS result indicates that toluene may be oxidized in the sequence of toluene - benzyl alcohol - benzaldehyde-benzoic acid - acetic acid, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, 4-hydroxy-, cyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione - carbon dioxide. This method provides a route for the resource utilization of spent LIBs and the synthesis of MnO<sub>2</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
