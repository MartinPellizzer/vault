The inhalation system had the following novel features: a canister vacuum cleaner that supplied room air without the need for precleaning or humidification; a 7% oxygen-in-nitrogen feed to a commercial ultraviolet ozonator that avoided an excess production of ozone; a compact inline mixer that assured homogeneous mixing of the 200-300 liters per minute room air supply with the 0.5-1.0 liters per minute of ozonated gas flow, positioning of gas inlet and exhaust hoses on the head dome that provided fresh gas delivery in the vicinity of the mouth; a quick-disconnect neck seal that allowed rapid donning of the head dome by the subject, and mounting of most system components on a small mobile cart. Temperature, humidity, and ozone and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured inside the dome while a subject exercised on a bicycle ergometer. An air flow of 200 liters per minute between rest and light exercise created a suitable microenvironment in the dome. During moderate and heavy exercise, however, a higher flow of 300 liters per minute should be used to suppress the build-up of carbon dioxide and humidity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asplund", "ForeName": "P T", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-Jebria", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ultman", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES06075", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manikins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Gas Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8638965", "10.1080/00039896.1996.9936007"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
