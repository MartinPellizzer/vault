In order to better understand the results, single ozonation and neat photolysis were also carried out. OXA has a high refractory character relatively to single ozonation and neat photolysis only accounted for 26% conversion of OXA after 2 h of reaction. On the other hand, OXA complete degradation was observed in less than an hour when ozone and light were used simultaneously. Despite OMA, a compound never studied before by a combined ozonation and photolysis treatment, being highly refractory to oxidation, more than 50% was removed by photo-ozonation after 3 h of reaction. In the case of ANL, both single ozonation and photo-ozonation resulted in 100% removal in a short reaction period due to the high reactivity of ozone to attack this type of molecules; however, only the combined method leads to efficient mineralization (89%) after 3 h of reaction. A significant synergetic effect was observed in the degradation of the selected contaminants by the simultaneous use of ozone and light, since the mineralization rate of combined method is higher than the sum of the mineralization rates of the individual treatments. The promising results observed in the degradation of the selected contaminants are paving the way to the application of photo-ozonation in the treatment of wastewater containing this type of pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a LCM - Laborat\u00f3rio de Cat\u00e1lise e Materiais - Laborat\u00f3rio Associado LSRE/LCM, Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Engenharia , Universidade do Porto , Rua Dr. Roberto Frias s/n, Porto 4200-465 , Portugal."}], "LastName": "Orge", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Faria", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "M F R", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E7R5L6H31", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QU60N5OPLG", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SIR7XX2F1K", "NameOfSubstance": "aniline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aniline Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25295389", "10.1080/09593330.2014.974682"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
