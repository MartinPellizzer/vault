This fact determines the expediency of targeted correction of disorders of the balance of pro- and antioxidant systems in blood and tissues caused by intense physical training. <b>The aim</b> of the work was to study the effect of vitamin-mineral complex on the parameters of oxidative blood metabolism in professional athletes. <b>Material and methods</b>. The prospective study included 74 professional athletes representing cyclic sports and randomized into 2 groups: the main group (n=42), who personalized received one of two vitamin-mineral complexes (with different concentrations of antioxidants), and a control group (n=32), who received a placebo. The duration of the course of daily intake of vitamin-mineral complex, an additional source of vitamins C, E, A, D, group B, minerals and trace elements, a source of \u03b2-carotene (1.5 mg), lutein (4.5 mg) and L-carnitine, was 30 days. The parameters of oxidative metabolism of blood (the level of 8-isoprostan, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, superoxide dismutase activity, the concentration of carotenes, tocopherols, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin) were studied in the athletes of both groups before and after the course of intake, and in the main group these results were used to individualize the metabolic correction. <b>Results</b>. After completing the course of metabolic support, an increase in the concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin (1.26 fold), \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotene (1.21 and 1.17 fold, respectively), \u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherol (1.46 and 1.62 fold), and the coefficient vitamin E/cholesterol (1.18 fold) have been demonstrated in athletes. In addition, activation of superoxide dismutase (1.24 fold) and a decrease in the level of 8-isoprostane (1.49 fold) have been recorded. No such changes have been observed in the athletes included in the control group. <b>Conclusion</b>. It was found that the course of metabolic support, including the use of individually prescribed vitamin-mineral complex, allowed to optimize the state of oxidative metabolism of athletes blood plasma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0818-5316"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Privolzhsky Research Medical University, 603155, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Association of Russian Ozone Therapy, 603089, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation."}], "LastName": "Martusevich", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5110-3718"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioniq High-Tech Solutions, SE115JH, London, Great Britain."}], "LastName": "Karuzin", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vopr Pitan", "NlmUniqueID": "2984870R", "ISSNLinking": "0042-8833"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Athletes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no overt and potential conflict of interest related to the publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33740332", "10.33029/0042-8833-2021-90-1-94-101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
