However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate plant responses to solar (ambient) UV-B and their interactions with response mechanisms activated by other stressors remain for the most part unclear. Using a microarray enriched in wound- and insect-responsive sequences, we examined expression responses of 241 genes to ambient UV-B in field-grown plants of Nicotiana longiflora Cav. Approximately 20% of the sequences represented on the array showed differential expression in response to solar UV-B. The expression responses to UV-B had parallels with those elicited by simulated Manduca sexta herbivory. The most obvious similarities were: (a) down-regulation of several photosynthesis-related genes, and (b) up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and oxylipin biosynthesis such as HPL (hydroperoxide lyase), alpha-DIOX (alpha-dioxygenase), LOX (13-lipoxygenase), and AOS (allene oxide synthase). Genes encoding a WRKY transcription factor, a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate-synthase, and several other insect-responsive genes of unknown function were also similarly regulated by UV-B and insect herbivory treatments. Our results suggest that UV-B and caterpillar herbivory activate common regulatory elements and provide a platform for understanding the mechanisms of UV-B impacts on insect herbivory that have been documented in recent field studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ifeva, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izaguirre", "ForeName": "Miriam M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scopel", "ForeName": "Ana L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baldwin", "ForeName": "Ian T", "Initials": "IT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ballar\u00e9", "ForeName": "Carlos L", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Manduca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "parasitology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "A.-H.-Mackerness S, Butt PJ, Jordan BR, Thomas B (1996) Amelioration of ultraviolet-B-induced down-regulation of mRNA levels for chloroplast proteins, by high irradiance, is mediated by photosynthesis.
