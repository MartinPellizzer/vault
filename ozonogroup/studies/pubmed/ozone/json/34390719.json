Siliceous ferrihydrite (FhSi) was readily synthesized in this study by co-precipitation. The formation of Fe-O-Si linkages did not alter the amorphous state of pure Fh, but increased the surface area (S<sub>BET</sub>), reduced the point of zero charge (pH<sub>ZPC</sub>), and prevented the leaching of more iron. X-ray diffraction, M\u00f6ssbauer and pyridine-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, and potentiometric titration revealed the presence of silicon-occupied portions of growth sites on the Fh surface, which increased the coordination symmetry around the Fe atom and inhibited the transition of Fh to more stable crystalline Fe (hydr)oxides during repeated use. Meanwhile, the density of surface hydroxyl groups (Ds) and the total acid content of the catalytic system after five cycles of catalytic ozonation were 56.75\u00a0% and 63.58\u00a0% higher than those of freshly prepared system, thereby benefiting the catalysis of ozone for generating \u00b7OH. In addition, the lower pH<sub>ZPC</sub> of the FhSi/O<sub>3</sub> system compared to that of the Fh/O<sub>3</sub> system promoted the generation of neutral surface-hydroxyl species on the surface of FhSi, which enabled a decent catalytic performance in alkaline solutions, regardless of the catalytic cycle. Moreover, the removal of humic acids (HA) followed a hydroxy radical reaction, which involved self-decomposition (14.15\u00a0%), catalytic ozonation (21.58\u00a0%), and peroxone and Fenton-like reactions (64.27\u00a0%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
