Effects of operating parameters on the removals of total organic carbon (TOC), color and UV absorbance at 254\u202fnm (A<sub>254</sub>) were investigated during coagulation and ozonation. All the removal efficiencies of TOC, A<sub>254</sub> and color of FeCl<sub>3</sub> coagulant are about twice those of AlCl<sub>3</sub> coagulant at the same molar dose since almost all the molecular weight fractions of RO concentrate (ROC) could be removed effectively by FeCl<sub>3</sub> coagulant while only the fractions of molecular weight\u202f>\u202f3\u202fk Da could be removed effectively by AlCl<sub>3</sub> coagulant. The TOC removal increases with the increasing of ozone dose and reaction temperature during ozonation of ROC after coagulation pretreatment. TOC and color of ROC after pretreated by coagulation could be further removed effectively during ozonation since ozonation can significant reduce the fluorescence response of all the fractions of effluent organic matter in ROC. It is unexpectedly found that the increase of A<sub>254</sub> is observed after ozonation, this is because the intensity of absorbance at 254\u202fnm by the low molecular weight transformation products (<2\u202fk Da) increases significantly with the reaction time after 30\u202fmin. The coagulation coupling with ozonation is efficient in the removals of both TOC and color of ROC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
