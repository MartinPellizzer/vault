The catalyst was well characterized and the catalytic efficiency under various conditions was systematically evaluated. TiO<sub>2</sub>/C has a disordered mesostructure with a high specific surface area. 92.8% of p-CNB (2 \u03bcmol/L) can be degraded within 20 min in the TiO<sub>2</sub>/C/O<sub>3</sub> system in the presence of 1 mg/L O<sub>3</sub>, 100 mg/L catalyst, at pH = 5. Based on the evaluation of the effect of basic parameters, it could be deduced that the removal of p-CNB relied on the synthetic effect of catalysis by TiO<sub>2</sub>/C and the autocatalytic induction of p-CNB. The removal efficiency of p-CNB, the structure change and the leaching of Ti ions were also evaluated in five cycles, indicating TiO<sub>2</sub>/C is stable and recyclable for catalytic ozonation in water treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qun", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jingnan", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Materials and Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu 610059, China and Sichuan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Chengdu 610091, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Geosciences and Environmental Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mengling", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, P.R.
