To understand the wavelength-specific effects of UV light, Molt4 cells (human T lymphoma cells) were irradiated with a series of monochromatic UV lights and the activities of three members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase group were examined. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase was specifically activated within 1 min after UV irradiation in the range 320-360 nm. In contrast, P38 kinase was activated by 270-280 nm light with a peak at 1 min after irradiation. c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation was observed in a narrow range of UV light with a sharp peak at 280 nm occurring in 10 min. JNK translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus upon irradiation, while P38 remained in the cytosol even after UV irradiation. The activation of three MAP kinases was prevented by antioxidant reagents, suggesting that an oxidative signal initiates these responses. These results confirm that UV light affects various cellular functions through the activation of intracellular signaling systems including MAP kinase family proteins. However, the UV-induced activities of the separate MAP kinases show distinctly different dose, time and wavelength dependencies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Science, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Hikariga Fukushima, 960-1295  Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kabuyama", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sekimata", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homma", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photobiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11272728", "10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0147:wsaomk>2.0.co;2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
