This system is designed to generate and monitor consistent, reproducible levels of ozone, over a range of concentrations, in a humidified atmosphere, and to allow an exposure time of 24 h or longer. Based on chemical analysis, highly reproducible concentrations of ozone are delivered throughout the chamber, with a coefficient of variation of < 5% between five replicate vials exposed to 0.5 ppm of ozone for 50 min. The viability of cultured human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, as measured by the ability to oxidize a vital dye, and of rat tracheal epithelium, as measured by total numbers of necrotic cells in tracheal explants, after ozone exposure was examined in this system. Responses of cultured cells to ozone exposure as measured by bioassay were consistent with the observed low level of variability of ozone concentration between replicate incubation dishes or vials. Responses of cultured cells to ozone were proportional to duration of exposure and inversely proportional to the volume of medium covering the cells. We conclude that this newly developed in vitro exposure system will allow relatively simple and convenient exposure of cultured cells or organs to ozone or other gaseous agents under highly controlled and reproducible conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "California Regional Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis 95616-8542."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarkington", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nikula", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Last", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-35635", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "RR-00169", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8160205", "10.1016/0300-483x(94)90110-4", "0300-483X(94)90110-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
