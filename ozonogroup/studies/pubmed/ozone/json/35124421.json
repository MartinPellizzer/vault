In this study, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) treatments caused the up-regulation of Malus crabapple structural genes McANS, McCHI, McANR and McF3H, which promoted anthocyanin and PA accumulation. We identified the WRKY transcription factor (TF) McWRKY71 by screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were highly expressed in response to O<sub>3</sub> stress from an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Overexpressing McWRKY71 increased the resistance of 'Orin' apple calli to O<sub>3</sub> stress and promoted the accumulation of anthocyanins and PAs, which facilitated reactive oxygen species scavenging to further enhance O<sub>3</sub> tolerance. Biochemical and molecular analyses showed that McWRKY71 interacted with McMYB12 and directly bound the McANR promoter to participate in the regulation of PA biosynthesis. These findings provide new insights into the WRKY TFs mechanisms that regulate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which respond to O<sub>3</sub> stress, in Malus crabapple."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
