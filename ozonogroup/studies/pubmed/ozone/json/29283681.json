We compared levels of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone at patient residences with emergency department cases, hospitalizations, objectively defined severe pneumonia, and mortality. We calculated direct cost impacts of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter reduction.", "We evaluated 4,336 pneumonia cases in seven hospitals. Among adults aged 65 years and older, we found consistently positive associations between particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter within 6 days of presentation and instances of pneumonia (Lag Day 1 adjusted odds ratio, 1.35 per 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> over 12 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.57), severe pneumonia (Lag Day 1 adjusted odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.80), and inpatient mortality (Lag Day 5 adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.16). Smaller associations were found between nitrogen dioxide exposure and pneumonia occurrence, severity, and inpatient and 30-day mortality. Ozone exposure was modestly associated with increased instance and severity of pneumonia in younger adults. Particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter and nitrogen dioxide effects were greatest in colder months, and ozone effects were greatest in warmer months. Reduction of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter levels to less than 12.0 mg/m<sup>3</sup> could prevent 76-112 cases of pneumonia per year in these hospitals serving approximately half of the Wasatch Front's population, reducing direct medical facility costs by $807,000 annually.", "Among older adults, short-term ambient particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter exposure is associated with more emergency department visits and hospitalizations for pneumonia, severe pneumonia, increased mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone modestly increase pneumonia risk and illness severity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1533-1916"], "LastName": "Pirozzi", "ForeName": "Cheryl S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah; and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Barbara E", "Initials": "BE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "VanDerslice", "ForeName": "James A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Division of Public Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Division of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah; and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paine", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R", "Suffix": "3rd"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Intermountain Medical Center and LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dean", "ForeName": "Nathan C", "Initials": "NC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Am Thorac Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "101600811", "ISSNLinking": "2325-6621"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2018 Apr;15(4):422-423. doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201801-031ED", "PMID": "29600893"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Emergency Service, Hospital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Health Care Costs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29283681", "10.1513/AnnalsATS.201706-495OC"]}}]}
