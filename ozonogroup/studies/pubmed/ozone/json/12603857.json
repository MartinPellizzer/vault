Reactive oxygen species are believed to be involved in cancer, aging, and inflammatory skin disorders. We have developed a method to measure catalase and superoxide dismutase activity on tape strippings from the human stratum corneum and demonstrated a gradient of antioxidant enzyme activity across the stratum corneum with decreasing levels towards the skin surface. Sun exposure resulted in a seasonal variation of the catalase activity in stratum corneum, with low activities in summer and higher activities in winter for the same person, whereas superoxide dismutase activity in stratum corneum did not seem to vary in those conditions. Exposure of human skin to broadband ultraviolet-A resulted in a dose-dependent deactivation of the catalase activity in stratum corneum within 24 h, whereas exposure to ultraviolet-B had no effect. Superoxide dismutase activity in stratum corneum was not affected by ultraviolet-A or ultraviolet-B irradiation within 24 h. After exposure to a dose of 15 J per cm2 broadband ultraviolet-A, full recovery of the catalase activity occurred in 3-4 wk at an age-dependent rate. We conclude that sun exposure results in a disturbed catalase to superoxide dismutase ratio in the stratum corneum. This may lead to an increased vulnerability to oxidative damage in stratum corneum barrier components. These results therefore stress the importance of providing efficient protection for this internal defense mechanism in sun-exposed areas of the skin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Research Department Europe, Est\u00e9e Lauder Coordination Center, Oevel, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hellemans", "ForeName": "Lieveke", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Corstjens", "ForeName": "Hugo", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neven", "ForeName": "Ann", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Declercq", "ForeName": "Lieve", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maes", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "0426720", "ISSNLinking": "0022-202X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12603857", "10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12056.x", "S0022-202X(15)30203-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
