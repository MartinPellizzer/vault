A total of 47\u2009107 visits were classified as asthma exacerbations. Concentration of air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, fine particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 \u2009\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>) and 2.5\u2009\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)), as well as meteorological data, evolution of respiratory syncytial virus infection and pollen exposition, were collected on an hourly or daily basis for the same period using institutional databases. To assess the association between air pollution and asthma, mixed-effects quasi-Poisson regression modelling was performed.", "The only compound independently associated with ED visits for asthma was PM<sub>2.5</sub> (P<10<sup>-4</sup>). The association between asthma exacerbation and PM<sub>2.5</sub> was not linear, and a sigmoid function described the relationshipsatisfactorily. PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration, which gives half the maximum effect, was estimated at 13.5\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>.", "We found an association between daily asthma exacerbation in paediatric visits to the ED and fine particulate air pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
