Several chemicals have been evaluated to protect plants against O<sub>3</sub> deleterious effects. However, they are not adequately efficient and/or the environmental safety of their application is questioned. Hence, new chemicals that provide sufficient protection while being safer for environmental application are needed. This study investigates the response of two O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive plant species (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Pinto and Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bel-W3) leaf-sprayed with deionized water (W, control), ethylenediurea (EDU, 1\u00a0mM) or melatonin at lower (1\u00a0mM) or higher (3\u00a0mM) concentrations (Mel_L and Mel_H, respectively), and then exposed to a square wave of 200\u00a0ppb O<sub>3</sub>, lasting 1 day (5\u00a0h day<sup>-1</sup>) for bean and 2 days (8\u00a0h day<sup>-1</sup>) for tobacco. In both species, the photosynthetic activity of O<sub>3</sub>-exposed plants was about halved. O<sub>3</sub>-induced membrane damage was also confirmed by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) byproducts compared to control (W). In EDU- and Mel-treated bean plants, the photosynthetic performance was not influenced by O<sub>3</sub>, leading to reduction of the incidence and severity of O<sub>3</sub> visible injury. In bean plants, Mel_L mitigated the detrimental effect of O<sub>3</sub> by boosting antioxidant enzyme activities or osmoprotectants (e.g. abscisic acid, proline, and glutathione transferase). In Mel_L-sprayed tobacco plants, O<sub>3</sub> negatively influenced the photosynthetic activity. Conversely, Mel_H ameliorated the O<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative stress by preserving the photosynthetic performance, preventing membrane damage, and reducing the visible injuries extent. Although EDU performed better, melatonin protected plants against O<sub>3</sub> phytotoxicity, suggesting its potential application as a bio-safer and eco-friendlier phytoprotectant against O<sub>3</sub>. It is worth noting that the content of melatonin in EDU-treated plants remained unchanged, indicating that the protectant mode of action of EDU is not Mel-related."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
