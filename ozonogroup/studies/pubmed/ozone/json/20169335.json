Its analytical performance satisfactorily compared to a perfluorinated chloroformate previously described, namely 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentyl chloroformate (OFPCF). The chemical properties (reactivity, selectivity, derivatization products, and their chromatographic and spectral features) for ClOFPCF were investigated using a set of 39 highly polar standard analytes, including, among others, hydroxylamine, malic and succinic acids, resorcinol, hydroxybenzaldehyde, and dihydroxybenzoic acid. Upon derivatization, the analytes were extracted from the aqueous solvent and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) in the electron-capture negative ionization (ECNI) mode. Positive chemical ionization (PCI)-MS was used for confirming the molecular ions, which were virtually absent in the ECNI mass spectra. ClOFPCF showed good reaction efficiency, good chromatographic and spectroscopic properties (better than with OFPCF), good linearity in calibration curves, and low detection limits (0.3-1 microg/L). A unique feature of the derivatizations with ClOFPCF, and, in general, highly fluorinated chloroformates, is their effectiveness in reacting with carboxylic, hydroxylic, and aminic groups at once, forming multiply-substituted non-polar derivatives that can be easily extracted from the aqueous phase and determined by GC-ECNI-MS. The entire procedure from raw aqueous sample to ready-to-inject hexane solution of the derivatives requires less than 10 min. Another benefit of this procedure is that it produced stable derivatives, with optimal volatility for GC separation, and high electron affinity, which allows their detection as negative ions at trace level. In addition, their mass spectra exhibits chlorine isotopic patterns that clearly indicate how many polar hydrogens of the analyte undergo derivatization. Finally, derivatization with ClOFPCF was used successfully to identify 13 unknown highly polar disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in ozonated fulvic and humic acid aqueous solutions and in real ozonated drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica Analitica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Torino, Via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Torino, Italy. marco.vincenti@unito.it."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vincenti", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica Analitica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Torino, Via Pietro Giuria 5, 10125, Torino, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fasano", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Traumatologia, Ortopedia e Medicina del Lavoro, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Torino, Via Zuretti 29, 10126, Torino, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valsania", "ForeName": "Maria Carmen", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Solvay Solexis S.p.A., Viale Lombardia, 20, Bollate, 20021, Milan, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guarda", "ForeName": "Pierantonio", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Exposure Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Athens, GA, 30605, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richardson", "ForeName": "Susan D", "Initials": "SD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "5-chloro-2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-1-pentyl chloroformate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Formates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "463-73-0", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorocarbonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XII14C5FXV", "NameOfSubstance": "fulvic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Formates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20169335", "10.1007/s00216-010-3477-2", "10.1007/s00216-010-3477-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
