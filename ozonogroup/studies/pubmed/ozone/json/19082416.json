Camacho) were analyzed in order to relate them to ambient ozone exposure and to subsequent stomatally absorbed ozone fluxes. The aim of this study is to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of a computer model (SODA) to calculate the mesophyll resistance (rm) to ozone uptake, the percentage of ozone detoxification by apoplastic ascorbic acid, and the ozone flux to the plasmalemma (Fm) in a Mediterranean durum wheat cultivar. These calculated factors were related to apoplastic ascorbic acid levels and to ambient ozone concentrations. These relationships were obtained with a view to explaining the detoxification of ozone by apoplastic ascorbic acid. Ozone detoxifications of up to 52% were found at midday, when maximum ozone concentrations and maximum apoplastic ascorbic acid are seen. Mesophyll resistance was minimum at this time, and ozone flux to the plasmalemma was reduced because of the reaction of ozone with apoplastic ascorbic acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Plant Biology Department, ETSI Agr\u00f3nomos, 28040 Madrid. daniel.delatorre@upm.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de la Torre", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ScientificWorldJournal", "NlmUniqueID": "101131163", "ISSNLinking": "1537-744X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19082416", "PMC5848639", "10.1100/tsw.2008.149"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
