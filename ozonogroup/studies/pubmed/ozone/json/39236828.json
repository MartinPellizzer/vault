The April-September MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> level increases significantly by 2.26\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup> from 2015 to 2023, with meteorological factors occupying merely 18\u00a0% in line with multivariate linear regression. To reveal the impact of anthropogenic emissions on O<sub>3</sub> increase, O<sub>3</sub> production sensitivity is accurately diagnosed by deriving localized thresholds for satellite formaldehyde (HCHO) to NO<sub>2</sub> ratio and validated by in-situ measurements and observation-based model. Tracking volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx through satellite HCHO and NO<sub>2</sub>, the O<sub>3</sub> responses to precursor changes are assessed for long-term and special cases, and appropriate precursor reduction ratios are inferred. The results present that the transition range of satellite HCHO/NO<sub>2</sub> from VOC-limited to NOx-limited in the region ranges from 2.7 to 4.3. The VOC-limited regime is concentrated in the urban areas of Chongqing and Chengdu as well as the central of the neighboring cities such as Deyang, Mianyang, and Meishan. The relative incremental reactivity from in-situ observations and box model at three sites in August 2019 demonstrates that O<sub>3</sub> is most sensitive to anthropogenic VOC at urban and suburban sites, consistent with satellite results. Satellite and surface NO<sub>2</sub> decrease at an annual rate of -2.1\u00a0% and\u00a0-\u00a02.9\u00a0% between 2015 and 2023, with larger decreases in Chengdu and Chongqing. In contrast, the trend of satellite HCHO is insignificant, indicating effective reduction in NOx but no significant reduction in VOC. This inappropriate reduction results in an increase in urban O<sub>3</sub>. The three short-term cases further validate the need for synergistic NOx and VOC reductions. Based on the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and satellite NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO, the minimum and optimal reduction ratios of VOC to NOx are 0.4:1 and 2.4:1 for the entire region, with higher ratios in Chengdu and Chongqing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
