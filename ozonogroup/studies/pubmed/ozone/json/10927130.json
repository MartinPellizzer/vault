Additional 'control' plants were placed in chambers ventilated with charcoal/Purafil(R)-filtered air. All trees were well watered throughout the whole experimental period. During the exposure period, ambient levels of sulphur dioxide were very low, whilst the accumulated hourly exposure to ozone above 40 ppb (i.e. AOT40) exceeded 20000 ppb h(-1) - peak hourly ozone concentrations rising to levels above 100 ppb. Trees exposed to ambient levels of air pollution exhibited typical symptoms of ozone damage (chlorotic mottle) on previous year needles toward the end of the summer. Similar symptoms were not observed on equivalent trees exposed to filtered-air, nor were visible symptoms accompanied by insect or pest infestation. Anatomical and ultrastructural observations made on symptomatic needles revealed degeneration in mesophyll cells bordering sub-stomatal cavities and alterations in chloroplast ultrastructure (fat accumulation, starch and tannin pattern modifications). These observations are consistent with the known effects of air pollutants (namely ozone) recorded in the literature. Findings are discussed in relation to the impacts of ozone on P. halepensis in the Mediterranean region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, University of Florence, Piazzale delle Cascine 28, I-50144, Firenze, Italy"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soda", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bussotti", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grossoni", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tani", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "7610775", "ISSNLinking": "0098-8472"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10927130", "10.1016/s0098-8472(00)00055-1", "S0098847200000551"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
