Considering the gradual decline in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and the aggravation of ozone pollution, a better understanding of the coordinated control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone is urgently needed. Here, we collected and sorted air pollutant data for 337 cities from 2015 to 2020 to explore the characteristics of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution based on China's five major air pollution regions. The results show that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the emission reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone precursors, and control NO<sub>x</sub> and VOCs while promoting a dramatic emission reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The primary method of curbing ozone pollution is to strengthen the emission control of VOCs, with a long-term strategy of achieving substantial emission reductions in NO<sub>x</sub>, because VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> are also precursors to PM<sub>2.5</sub>; hence, their reductions also contribute to the reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Therefore, the implementation of a multipollutant emission reduction control strategy aimed at the prevention and control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone pollution is the only means to realize the coordinated control of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
