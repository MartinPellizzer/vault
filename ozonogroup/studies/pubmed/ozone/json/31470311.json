The Fe-based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation was in parallel investigated and compared in terms of contaminant removal efficiency and biodegradability variation. The Fe-based heterogeneous catalyst carried the higher potential to improve the biodegradability of ROC (i.e., 0.32 v. s. 0.27 for B/C, the ratio between BOD<sub>5</sub> and COD) although its direct COD removal efficiency was inferior to the homogeneous one (i.e., 49% v. s. 59% after 25\u202fmin' reaction). The ROC pretreated by the Fe-based heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for 5\u202fmin was further treated by biodegradation. After the hybrid treatment, the COD concentration reached \u223c40\u202fmg/L meeting with the discharge standard (GB, 18918-2002), under the optimal reaction conditions of 2.0\u202fL/min ozone flow rate for catalytic ozonation and 120\u202fmin' aeration for biodegradation. The solution pH should not be adjusted by taking both the treatment efficiency and operating cost into consideration. The treatment cost of the hybrid process was estimated to be 0.15 USD/m<sup>3</sup>. This work could provide a feasible and economic option for the proper management of the industrial-based ROC and should be of interest to the application fields."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
