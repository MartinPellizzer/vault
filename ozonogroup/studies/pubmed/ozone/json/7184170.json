According to manufacturers' data, such devices may be applied for various purposes, e.g. the creation of a defined air temperature or humidity, an increase of the supply of outdoor air, the cleaning and deodorization of indoor air or the alteration of the so-called electric climate of a room. The hygienic health evaluation of the different types of air conditioning devices should establish whether --there are aspects of health necessitating alterations of the microclimate of a room; --such alterations could be brought about in a more economic way by purely constructional or individual measures; --the function of individual apparatuses could be accomplished in a better way by replacing them by a larger device serving several rooms; --the operation of such devices may produce adverse health effects such as nuisance by noise, formation of undesirable gases (ozone), danger owing to non-adherence to electric safety rules; --there will be no damage to rooms and furniture, e.g. by water droplets. A look at a number of commercially available devices shows that they are generally dispensable. There are, however, special rare cases where the use of such devices may result in an improvement of the quality of indoor environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wegner", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Bauhygienische Bedeutung von Ger\u00e4ten zur Raumluftbehandlung."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Schriftenr Ver Wasser Boden Lufthyg", "NlmUniqueID": "7507514", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8665"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Conditioning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment, Controlled"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventilation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7184170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
