The transepidermal potential (TEP), the potential difference between the skin surface and the subepidermal region, was measured using this inner electrode and a conventional agar electrode on the surface of the skin. Control of penetration depth of the inner electrode with a spacer and hydrophilic pretreatment with ozone plasma were found to be necessary for stable measurement. The TEP was reduced upon damages on the skin surface by tape stripping and acetone defatting, which indicated the fabricated needle electrode is useful for the minimally-invasive measurement of TEP and evaluation of skin barrier functions. Furthermore, we showed that the device integrating two electrodes into a single compact probe was useful to evaluate the local barrier functions and their mapping on a skin. This device could be a personal diagnostic tool in the fields of medicine and cosmetics in future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Finemechanics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-01 Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan."}], "LastName": "Abe", "ForeName": "Yuina", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Finemechanics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-01 Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nagamine", "ForeName": "Kuniaki", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Finemechanics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-01 Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakabayashi", "ForeName": "Mayu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Finemechanics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-01 Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kai", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Finemechanics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-01 Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kaji", "ForeName": "Hirokazu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamauchi", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamasaki", "ForeName": "Kenshi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Finemechanics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, 6-6-01 Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan. nishizawa@biomems.mech.tohoku.ac.jp."}], "LastName": "Nishizawa", "ForeName": "Matsuhiko", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Microdevices", "NlmUniqueID": "100887374", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-18-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agar"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Needles"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Potentiometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27294487", "10.1007/s10544-016-0080-0", "10.1007/s10544-016-0080-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
