Both O-2,3,4,5,6-(pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA) and 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)ethylene (DPE) were loaded onto the fiber before sampling. The SPME fiber assembly was then inserted into a PTFE tubing as a passive sampler. Known concentrations of ozone around the ambient ground level were generated by a calibrated ozone generator. Laboratory validations of the SPME passive sampler with the direct-reading ozone monitor were performed side-by-side in an exposure chamber at 25 degrees C. After exposures, pyriden-4-aldehyde was formed due to the reaction between DPE and ozone. Further on-fiber derivatizations between pyriden-4-aldehyde and PFBHA were followed and the derivatives, oximes, were then determined by portable gas chromatography with electron capture detector. The experimental sampling rate of the SPME ozone passive sampler was found to be 1.10 x 10(-4) cm(3) s(-1) with detection limit of 58.8 microg m(-3) h(-1). Field validations with both SPME device and the direct-reading ozone monitor were also performed. The correlations between the results from both methods were found to be consistent with r=0.9837. Compared with other methods, the current designed sampler provides a convenient and sensitive tool for the exposure assessments of ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Health, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, No. 17, Xuzhou Road, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "I-Su", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Shih-Wei", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0370534", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2670"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18291125", "10.1016/j.aca.2008.01.035", "S0003-2670(08)00134-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
