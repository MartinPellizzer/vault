The metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) plays an important role in platelet activation and oxidative stress. However, AA metabolic pathways have not been examined in relation to O<sub>3</sub> and other air pollutants.", "Early morning urine and fasting blood were longitudinally collected up to four times from 89 healthy adults (22-52\u00a0years old, 25 women) in Changsha City, China. We measured three urinary AA metabolites, namely 11-dehydro-Thromboxane B2 (11-dhTXB<sub>2</sub>) produced from the arachidonic cyclooxygenase pathway, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) from the CYPs pathway, and 8-isoprostane from the non-enzymatic pathway. Urinary malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured as indicators of oxidative damage to lipids and DNA, respectively. We measured soluble P-selectin (sCD62p) concentrations in plasma as an indicator of platelet activation. Indoor and outdoor air pollutants were measured and combined with participants' time-activity pattern to calculate personal exposure to O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> averaged over 12-hour, 24-hour, 1-week, and 2-week periods prior to biospecimen collection, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationships of AA metabolites with air pollutant exposures, plasma sCD62p, and urinary MDA & 8-OHdG.", "We found that a 10% increase in 12\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h O<sub>3</sub> exposure were associated with increases in urinary11-dhTXB<sub>2</sub> by 1.4% (95%, 0.1% to 2.6%) and 1.3% (0.05% to 2.5%), respectively. These associations remained robust after adjusting for co-pollutant exposures. No significant associations were observed between 11-dhTXB<sub>2</sub> and other pollutants or between O<sub>3</sub> exposures and other AA metabolites. All the three AA metabolites were significantly and positively associated with urinary MDA and 8-OHdG, whereas only urinary 11-dhTXB<sub>2</sub> was significantly and positively associated with plasma sCD62p.", "A metabolite of AA from the cyclooxygenase pathway was positively associated with short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure, and with a plasma marker of platelet activation and two urinary markers of oxidative stress. The results suggest that O<sub>3</sub> exposure may contribute to increased platelet activation and oxidative damages via altering the metabolism of AA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
