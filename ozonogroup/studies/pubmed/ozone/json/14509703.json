BOD at 5, 10 and 21 days, BOD/COD and BOD/TOC ratios and the average oxidation state are presented. Biodegradability measured as BOD5/COD ratio was increased from 0 of the original solution to 0.25 at the moment of removing all the initial compound (corresponding to an ozone dose of 0.12 g L-1, 0.48 for BOD21/COD ratio). To test the effect of this pre-treatment, the biological oxidation of these pre-ozonated solutions was performed in two semi-continuous stirred tank reactors, one with non-acclimated sludge and one with acclimated-to-phenol sludge. The study showed that the TOC content of the pre-treated solution could be removed up to 68% by an aerobic biological treatment as well as co-digested with municipal wastewater (TOC removal up to 82%), with similar operating retention times to a municipal wastewater plant (12-24 h). Kinetic studies based on Monod model have also been carried out. Pseudo-first-order kinetic constants were found to be in the range of 0.5-0.8 L g TVSS-1 h-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departament d'Enginyeria Qu\u00edmica i Metal-l\u00fargia, Universitat de Barcelona, Mart\u00ed i Franqu\u00e8s 1, Barcelona 08028, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Contreras", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "al Momani", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sans", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Esplugas", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthelmintics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R669TG1950", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-dichlorophenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthelmintics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14509703", "10.1016/s0043-1354(03)00167-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
