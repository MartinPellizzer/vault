The campaign was performed at a mountain station located near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The study has two main goals: firstly, to analyze the decreasing gradient of ozone concentration during the course of the Saharan episodes. These gradients vary from 0.2 to 0.6\u00a0ppb\u00a0h(-1) with an average value of 0.39\u00a0ppb\u00a0h(-1). The negative correlation between ozone and coarse particles occurs almost simultaneously. Moreover, although the concentration of coarse particles remained high throughout the episode, the time series shows the saturation of the ozone loss. The highest ozone depletion has been obtained during the last hours of the day, from 18:00 to 23:00 UTC. Outbreaks registered during this campaign have been more intense in this time slot. The second objective is to establish from which coarse particle concentration a significant ozone depletion can be observed and to quantify this reduction. In this regard, it has been confirmed that when the hourly particle concentration recorded during the Saharan dust outbreaks is above the hourly particle median values (N\u00a0>\u00a0N-median), the ozone concentration reduction obtained is statistically significant. An average ozone reduction of 5.5\u00a0% during Saharan events has been recorded. In certain cases, this percentage can reach values of higher than 15\u00a0%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Pollution Laboratory (LCA), Department of Applied Physics, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University, Avenida de la Universidad S/N, 03202, Elche, Spain. ruben87sm@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Soler", "ForeName": "Ruben", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Pollution Laboratory (LCA), Department of Applied Physics, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University, Avenida de la Universidad S/N, 03202, Elche, Spain."}], "LastName": "Nicol\u00e1s", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Pollution Laboratory (LCA), Department of Applied Physics, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University, Avenida de la Universidad S/N, 03202, Elche, Spain."}], "LastName": "Caballero", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Pollution Laboratory (LCA), Department of Applied Physics, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University, Avenida de la Universidad S/N, 03202, Elche, Spain."}], "LastName": "Yubero", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Pollution Laboratory (LCA), Department of Applied Physics, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University, Avenida de la Universidad S/N, 03202, Elche, Spain."}], "LastName": "Crespo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dust"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Outbreaks"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dust"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2012 Sep;19(8):3461-80", "ArticleIdList": ["22477164"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 2002 Oct 25;298(5594):794-9", "ArticleIdList": ["12399583"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2014 Feb 15;472:248-61", "ArticleIdList": ["24295746"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2008 Mar 1;391(2-3):241-51", "ArticleIdList": ["18063017"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2006 Nov;144(2):463-74", "ArticleIdList": ["16551488"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2014 Jan 1;466-467:439-46", "ArticleIdList": ["23933449"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2011 Sep;61(9):952-67", "ArticleIdList": ["22010380"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2002;118(2):167-86", "ArticleIdList": ["11939281"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27376369", "10.1007/s11356-016-7134-y", "10.1007/s11356-016-7134-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
