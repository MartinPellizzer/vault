However, as industrial waste, is strongly alkaline, low effectiveness, and safety concerns are problems that cannot be ignored, it is urgent to mine out a reasonable disposal and utilization technology for the waste. In this study, an effective catalyst (H-RM) was obtained by facile hydrogenation heating modification of red mud. Then above-prepared H-RM was applied in the catalytic ozonation degradation of levofloxacin (LEV). The H-RM exhibited more remarkable catalytic activities than the RM in terms of LEV degradation, and the optimal efficiency can reach over 90% within 50\u00a0min. The mechanism experiment proved that the concentration of dissolved ozone and hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) significantly increased, which enhanced the oxidation effect. Hydroxyl radical played a dominant role in the degradation of LEV. In the safety test, it is concluded that the concentration of total hexavalent chromium (total Cr(\u2165)) in the H-RM catalyst decreases and the leaching concentration of water-soluble Cr(\u2165) in aqueous solution is low. The results indicated that the hydrogenation technique is an available Cr (\u2165) detoxification method for RM. Moreover, the H-RM has excellent catalytic stability, which is beneficial to recycling and maintains high activity. This research provides an effective means to fulfill the reuse of industrial waste as an alternative to standard raw materials, and comprehensive utilization of the waste to attain the purpose of treating pollution with wastes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
