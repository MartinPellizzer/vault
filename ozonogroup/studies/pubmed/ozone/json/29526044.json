Ambient levels of NO<sub>2</sub> and particulate matter were modelled based upon satellite imaging data. Directly measured ozone, NO<sub>2</sub> and particulate matter levels were obtained from a monitoring station in central Leicester. Participants made daily electronic records of asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow and exhaled nitric oxide. Spirometry and asthma symptom questionnaires were completed at fortnightly study visits. Data were analysed using linear mixed effects models and cross-correlation.", "Cairclip exposure data were of good quality with clear evidence of diurnal variability and a missing data rate of approximately 20%. We were unable to detect consistent relationships between personal air pollution exposure and clinical outcomes in the group as a whole. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, total oxidant exposure was associated with increased daytime symptoms in women but not men.", "We did not find compelling evidence that air pollution exposure impacts on day-to-day clinical control in an unselected asthma population, but further studies are required in larger populations with higher exposure levels. Women may be more susceptible than men to the effects of air pollution, an observation which requires confirmation in future studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chambers", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Finch", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeanjean", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leigh", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6080-2246"], "LastName": "Gonem", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Department of Health", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"Agency": "British Heart Foundation", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"Agency": "Arthritis Research UK", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "8906443", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7894"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Susceptibility"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symptom Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29526044", "10.1111/cea.13130"]}}]}
