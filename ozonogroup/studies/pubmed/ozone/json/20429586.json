In this study, we identify and quantify volatile (C(10)) and intermediate-volatility (C(15)) BVOCs stored in and emitted from 22 prominent woody and herbaceous crops with a particular focus on sesquiterpenoids (SQTs), which have presented measurement challenges in previous studies. Monoterpenoids (MNTs) and SQTs were simultaneously emitted from all the crops studied; there were significant correlations between emission rates and leaf content for both MNTs and SQTs and additional correlations between MNTs and SQTs in both emissions and leaf content. Our results suggest that species with high concentrations of stored terpenoids in their leaves, such as those grown commercially for their essential oil content, are likely high BVOC emitters. Emissions from agricultural species were dominated by SQTs at low MNT emission rates (on the order of several tens of ng/(g(DM)*h)), while at higher MNT levels (on the order of several hundreds of ng/(g(DM)*h)), SQT emissions were approximately equivalent. Based on our empirical correlations, we estimate that global SQT emissions are similar to MNT emissions and on the order of 100 Tg yr(-1), which justifies the need for better representation of SQTs in both BVOC emission and atmospheric models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Ecosystem Sciences, Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. elenaormeno@berkeley.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orme\u00f1o", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gentner", "ForeName": "Drew R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fares", "ForeName": "Silvano", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karlik", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jeong Hoo", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20429586", "10.1021/es903674m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
