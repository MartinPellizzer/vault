As the supply of HFE7100 will cease by the end of 2025, suitable alternatives are required in the short-term to ensure the detection of latent fingermarks on porous surfaces is still effective. Although these solvents, with the exception of Amolea AS-300, are classified as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); they are not classed as hazardous. The alternatives in this study have a low global warming potential and atmospheric lifetime and are volatile, non-flammable and non-ozone depleting, in addition to other desirable properties such as a high wetting-index. During Phase 2 trials with deposited fingermarks, HFE7100 provided the best performing results followed by Opteon SF33, Solstice PF and Amolea AS-300. A significant difference with a negligible effect size was observed for ninhydrin formulations (p-value 0.00179; \u03b5<sup>2</sup> 0.00418) while a significant difference with a weak effect size was observed for 1,2-indanedione formulations (p-value 2.095 \u00d710<sup>-10</sup>; \u03b5<sup>2</sup> 0.0167). Furthermore, HFE7100 provided the least ink diffusion and the brightest 1,2-indanedione luminosity (significant difference with a moderate effect size p-value 1.772 \u00d710<sup>-13</sup>; \u03b5<sup>2</sup> 0.0434) but the HFE formulation turned cloudy more quickly and needed regular replacements. Phase 3 pseudo-operational trials of 100 porous items followed a similar trend whereby HFE7100 formulations detected the highest number of marks followed by Opteon SF33 and Solstice PF. Although HFE7100 is still the best performing carrier solvent, this study demonstrates that, in the short-term, Opteon SF33 and Solstice PF may have potential as non-flammable replacement carrier solvents while developing the long-term goal of solvent-less methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
