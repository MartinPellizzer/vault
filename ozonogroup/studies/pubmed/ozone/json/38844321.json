However, the low ozone mass transfer in packed bubble columns leads to low ozone utilization efficiency (OUE), poor organic degradation performance, and high energy consumption. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient supported catalysts that can enhance mass transfer and performance. However, the reaction mechanism of the support on ozone mass transfer remains unclear, which hinders the development of catalytic ozonation applications. In this study, lava rocks (LR)-supported catalysts, specifically CuMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LR and MnO<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LR, were proposed for catalytic ozonation of IBP degradation due to their superior catalytic activity, stability, and high OUE. Addition of CuMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LR or MnO<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LR increased IBP removal efficiency from 85% to 91% or 88%, and reduced energy consumption from 2.86 to 2.14 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> or 2.60 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. This improvement was attributed to LR-supported catalysts enhancing mass transfer and promoting O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to generate \u2022OH and \u2022O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, leading to IBP degradation. Furthermore, this study investigated the effects of ozone dose, supporter sizes, and catalyst components on ozone-liquid mass transfer. The results revealed that the size of the supporter influenced stacked porosity and consequently affected ozone mass transfer. Larger-sized LR (k<sub>L</sub>a= 0.172 min<sup>-1</sup>) exhibited better mass transfer compared to smaller-sized supports. Based on these findings, it was concluded that both CuMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LR and MnO<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LR are potential catalysts for catalytic ozonation in residual IBP degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater, and LR showed good credibility as a catalyst supporter. Understanding the effects of supporters and active components on ozone mass transfer provides a fundamental principle for designing supported catalysts in catalytic ozonation applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
