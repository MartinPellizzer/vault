Rats were intratracheal instillation of 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 mg/rat PM2.5 as low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose PM2.5 alone exposure groups. Ozone combined PM2.5 groups were exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone 4 hours and then instilled 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 mg/rat PM2.5 separately. Rats only inhaled 0.8 ppm ozone for 4 hours as ozone alone exposure group. Control rats were instilled with saline. Each exposure protocol applied twice a week for three continuous weeks. Systolic blood pressure and electrocardiograph (ECG) morphology of rats were recorded at 24 hours post-exposure of the last exposure. Serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and CRP were analyzed. Right ventricles were used as pathological examination with HE staining.", "HRV indices in PM2.5 alone and combined exposure groups showed significant difference compared to control. However, heart rate only reduced significantly in ozone combined PM2.5 groups. Blood pressure rose significantly in combined groups and high-dose PM2.5 alone exposure. TNF-alpha and IL-6 increased significantly in PM2.5 alone/and ozone groups. CRP showed obvious dose-dependent relationship in PM2.5 alone and combined groups. Cardiac histopathology results revealed that PM2.5 deposition and myocardial inflammation were also observed in high-dose PM2.5 rats.", "Ozone can enhance the cardiac autonomic nervous system and systemic inflammation induced by PM2.5."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China. 10111020016@fudan.edu.cn"}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guanghe", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "Lingyan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00fc", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Rongfang", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Weimin", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Yan Jiu", "NlmUniqueID": "9426367", "ISSNLinking": "1000-8020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Autonomic Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["innervation"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24024363"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
