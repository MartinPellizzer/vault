However, the human metabolism of 6PPD-Q has remained unknown. This study investigated the in vitro Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of 6PPD-Q in human and rat liver microsomes (HLMs and RLMs). 6PPD-Q was significantly metabolized at lower concentrations but slowed at high concentrations. The intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>) of 6PPD-Q was 21.10 and 18.58\u00a0\u03bcL\u00a0min<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0mg<sup>-1</sup> protein of HLMs and RLMs, respectively, suggesting low metabolic ability compared with other reported pollutants. Seven metabolites and one intermediate were identified, and metabolites were predicted immunotoxic or mutagenic toxicity. Mono- and di-oxygenation reactions were the main phase I in vitro metabolic pathways. Enzyme inhibition experiments and molecular docking techniques were further used to reveal the metabolic mechanism. CYP1A2, 3A4, and 2C19, especially CYP1A2, play critical roles in 6PPD-Q metabolism in HLMs, whereas 6PPD-Q is extensively metabolized in RLMs. Our study is the first to demonstrate the in vitro metabolic profile of 6PPD-Q in HLMs and RLMs. The results will significantly contribute to future human health management targeting the emerging pollutant 6PPD-Q."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
