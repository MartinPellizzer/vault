The HALs that were targeted included four trihalogenated acetaldehydes (THALs): chloral hydrate (CH), bromodichloroacetaldehyde (BDCAL), dibromochloroacetaldehyde (DBCAL) and tribromoacetaldehyde (TBAL). Three dihalogenated acetaldehydes (DHALs) were also included: dichloroacetaldehyde (DCAL), bromochloroacetaldehyde (BCAL) and dibromoacetaldehyde(DBAL). In addition to various sampling points in two distribution networks, this study also investigated the formation of HALs during water treatment and for the first time, reports the formation of DBAL before chlorine is applied. Low bromide levels in source waters from both systems resulted in the rare detection of DBAL and TBAL. CH accounted for >50% of total HALs (HAL7) with DHALs accounting for as little as 10% of HAL7, presumably due to the use of ozone-chlorine instead of ozone-chloramine. In the presence of chlorine residuals and with increasing water residence times, most HALs continued to form, more readily in warm water than in cold water. However, the spatial and temporal patterns for each HAL differed depending on speciation (THAL vs. DHAL) and water temperature. Compared to the relatively stable bromine incorporation factor (BIF) of THMs in the distribution systems, the decreasing BIFs of HALs according to water residence time increases suggested that bromine-containing THMs are more stable than their corresponding HALs. Re-chlorination at the extremities of the distribution networks demonstrated a significant impact on the occurrence and speciation of DBPs. In both full-scale systems, water temperature was shown to be the biggest contributing factor to HAL formation. The strong correlations between THM levels and THAL levels make it possible to predict the occurrence of THALs based on THMs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
