The films were produced by casting technique using native and ozonated cassava starch, glycerol as the plasticizer, and water as the solvent. Films were characterized in term of their mechanical, barrier and functional properties, morphology, crystallinity, colour, and opacity. The morphology of the ozonated films was more homogeneous in comparison to the films produced with the non-modified starch and enhanced properties were achieved. Films produced with ozonated cassava starch presented higher tensile strength, Young's modulus and lower elongation. The water vapour permeation and the oxygen permeation were increased by increasing the ozonation time. Moreover, ozone processing resulted in films with a more hydrophilic surface and lower solubility after 24\u202fh. Possible explanations and applications were discussed. In conclusion, the ozone processing showed to be a good alternative for starch based packaging production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
