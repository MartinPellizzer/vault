It displays a high potential value in sterilization and decontamination. Although O<sub>3</sub> has been widely investigated for its efficiency and environmentally friendly effectiveness, the fundamental issue regarding the complicated microscopic interaction mechanism between O<sub>3</sub> and contaminant molecules remains largely unaddressed. We addressed this knowledge gap through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at the molecular scale. Results indicated that five representative hydrocarbon molecules (n-hexadecane, phytane, terpane, naphthalin and acenaphthylene) on a rough silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) surface were almost removed after about 300 ps simulation. And the aromatic molecules were easier to be removed than aliphatic ones. The hydroxyl oxidation reaction was demonstrated as a predominant mechanism. As the large dose of O<sub>3</sub> was supplied by atmospheric air dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, this work provided an important theoretical reference for better using plasma technology for oily contaminant removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
