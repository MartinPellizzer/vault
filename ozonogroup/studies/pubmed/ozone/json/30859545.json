A common assumption in the causal inference literature in the presence of interference is partial interference, implying that the population can be partitioned in clusters of individuals whose potential outcomes only depend on the treatment of units within the same cluster. Previous literature has defined average potential outcomes under counterfactual scenarios where treatments are randomly allocated to units within a cluster. However, within clusters there may be units that are more or less likely to receive treatment based on covariates or neighbors' treatment. We define new estimands that describe average potential outcomes for realistic counterfactual treatment allocation programs, extending existing estimands to take into consideration the units' covariates and dependence between units' treatment assignment. We further propose entirely new estimands for population-level interventions over the collection of clusters, which correspond in the motivating setting to regulations at the federal (vs. cluster or regional) level. We discuss these estimands, propose unbiased estimators and derive asymptotic results as the number of clusters grows. For a small number of observed clusters, a bootstrap approach for confidence intervals is proposed. Finally, we estimate effects in a comparative effectiveness study of power plant emission reduction technologies on ambient ozone pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 International Biometric Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistical Science, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1982-2245"], "LastName": "Papadogeorgou", "ForeName": "Georgia", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Computer Science, Applications, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mealli", "ForeName": "Fabrizia", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics and Data Sciences and Department of Women's Health, University of Texas at Austin and Dell Medical School, Austin, Texas."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9611-5894"], "LastName": "Zigler", "ForeName": "Corwin M", "Initials": "CM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES026217", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R835872C004", "Agency": "EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biometrics", "NlmUniqueID": "0370625", "ISSNLinking": "0006-341X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Causality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ali M, Emch M, Von Seidlein L, Yunus M, Sack DA, Rao M, Holmgren J, and Clemens JD (2005).
