Because of oxidative reactions with the mucus in the upper airway, O3 reaction products are able to penetrate into the tracheobronchial epithelial (TE) cells. The carcinogenic effects of O3 on the TE cells are especially of interest since most previous studies have focused on the morphology or permeability changes of tracheas only. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the potential O3 genotoxicity in TE cells after an in vivo exposure, using DNA strand breaks as an index. Two-month-old male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs, specific pathogen free, 4 in each group, were exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. Animals exposed to filtered air without O3 exposure were used as controls. After O3 exposure, the trachea with two main bronchi was removed from each animal, and TE cells were isolated and employed for determination of DNA strand breaks by fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU). The statistical significance level was set at alpha = .05. Compared with controls, ozone exposure did not alter the TE cell yield or viability, but caused an increase in protein content in tracheal lavage and an increase in DNA strand breaks. The amount of DNA left in the alkali lysate of TE cells found at 72 h exposure was significantly decreased from controls for 3 different alkali incubation times. An increase of the double-stranded DNA left in the alkali lysate of TE cells was observed at 96 h of exposure and approached the value of 24 h of exposure. The same pattern was seen with all 3 different alkali incubation times at 15 degrees C. One Qd unit was estimated to correspond to 100 strand breaks per cell. The Qd was also used as an indicator for O3 damage. Compared to controls, the Qd increases significantly after 1 ppm O3 exposure for 72 h, regardless of the alkali incubation time at 15 degrees C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Safety, School of Health and Human Performance, Indiana State University, Terre Haute 47809, USA. hsferng@scifac.indstate.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferng", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castro", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Afifi", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berm\u00fadez", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9202716", "10.1080/00984109708984030"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
