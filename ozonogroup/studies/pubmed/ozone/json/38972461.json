In this study, we designed a multilayer gas diffusion electrode (GDE) decorated with a commercial hydrophobic membrane for the degradation of pyridine. It was found that a proper control of membrane pore sizes and hot-pressing temperature can significantly promote the GDE stability. Subsequently, key operational parameters of the constructed E-peroxone system were investigated, including the ozone concentration, current density, pH value, electrolyte type and initial concentration of pyridine. The degradation pathways were proposed according to six identified transformation products. The toxicity variation along the degradation progress was evaluated with microbial respiration tests and Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) calculation and an efficient detoxification capacity of E-peroxone was observed. This research provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the development of highly efficient and stable E-peroxone system for the elimination of toxic organic contaminants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
