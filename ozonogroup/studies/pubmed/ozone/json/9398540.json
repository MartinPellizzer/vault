Using a multispectrum nonlinear least-squares procedure, we fit 29 of these spectra simultaneously to determine the air-broadening and shift coefficients and their temperature dependences for 450 lines in the 9-&mgr;m region; most of these belong to the nu1 band. Partial air-broadening results were obtained for 104 additional lines, and room-temperature self-broadening coefficients were also determined for most of the 554 lines measured. These results cover a wide range of rotational quantum numbers, particularly in the R branch, with J\" </= 55 and Ka\" </= 12. The variation of the retrieved broadening and shift parameters with the rotational quantum numbers has been examined; particularly interesting behavior of the broadening coefficients is noted as the value of Ka\" approaches that of J\". The broadening and shift coefficients compare well with previous room-temperature measurements in the nu1 and other bands. The temperature-dependence results are also consistent (within the stated uncertainties) with the few previous measurements of the temperature dependence of air- and N2-broadening coefficients in other O3 bands, but disagree with the mean value given in the HITRAN compilation.
