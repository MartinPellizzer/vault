According to data from 1991 to 1996, ensemble neural network models increased explained variance an average of 7% over multiple linear regression models using the same input variables. Without modification, all models performed poorly on days when the observed peak ozone concentration exceeded 82 parts per billion, the National Ambient Air Quality Objective. When numbers of extreme events in training data were increased using a histogram equalization process, models were able to forecast exceedances with improved accuracy. Modified generalized additive model (GAM) plots and associated measures of input variable importance and interaction were generated for a subset of the trained models and used to investigate relationships between input variables and ozone levels. The neural network models displayed a high degree of interaction among inputs, and it is likely the ability of these model types to account for interactions, rather than the nonlinearity of individual input variables, that explains their improved forecast skill. Inspection of GAM-style plots indicated that the relative importance of input variables in the ensemble neural network models varied with geographic location within the LFV. Four distinct groups of stations were identified, and rankings of inputs within the groups were generally consistent with physical intuition and results of prior studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Weather Centre, Environment Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. alex.cannon@ec.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cannon", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lord", "ForeName": "E R", "Initials": "ER"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "British Columbia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neural Networks, Computer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10734705", "10.1080/10473289.2000.10464024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
