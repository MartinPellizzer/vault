Ozone events in the city typically occur in two peaks, characterized by a pronounced spring peak followed by a late summer peak. Despite higher ozone levels, the spring peak has received less attention than the summer peak. To address this research gap, we used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-driven GEOS-Chem (WRF-GC) model to simulate San Antonio's ozone changes in the spring month of May from 2017 to 2021 and quantified the respective contributions from changes in anthropogenic emissions and meteorology. In addition to modeling, observations from the San Antonio Field Studies (SAFS), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations (CAMS), and the spaceborne TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) are used to examine and validate changes in ozone and precursors. Results show that the simulated daytime mean surface ozone in May 2021 is 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 ppbv lower than in May 2017, which is slightly less than the observed average differences of -5.3 ppbv at CAMS sites. The model predicted that the anthropogenic emission-induced changes contribute to a 1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 ppbv reduction in daytime ozone levels, while the meteorology-induced changes account for a 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 ppbv reduction over 2017-2021. This suggests that meteorology plays a relatively more important role than anthropogenic emissions in explaining the spring ozone differences between the two years. We additionally identified (1) reduced NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO concentrations as chemical reasons, and (2) lower temperature, higher humidity, increased wind speed, and a stronger Bermuda High as meteorological reasons for lower ozone levels in 2021 compared to 2017. The quantification of the different roles of meteorology and ozone precursor concentrations helps understand the cause and variation of ozone changes in San Antonio over recent years."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
