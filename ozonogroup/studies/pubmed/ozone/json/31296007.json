The rate coefficients (<i>k</i><sub>ozone</sub>) measured for the BCA + ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) reaction at 295 \u00b1 2 K were 4.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH = 2 and 6.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH = 8. The UV-vis absorption cross sections (\u03c3, cm<sup>2</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup>) for BCA and LA in water were also measured. Atmospheric lifetimes of BCA and LA due to reactions with O<sub>3</sub>, hydroxyl radicals (OH), and due to photolysis were calculated. Lifetime estimates indicate that the aqueous-phase processing of both terpenoic acids studied in this work would be relevant in the atmosphere. In cloudwater, BCA is more likely to react with O<sub>3</sub> with some possible contribution from the oxidation by OH, whereas the opposite is true for LA. Products of BCA and LA ozonolysis were quantified with LC-MS as well as with the UV-vis assays for quantification of formaldehyde and hydroperoxides. Oxygenated derivatives of BCA and LA that were produced following aqueous ozonolysis were identified as keto-BCA and keto-LA, respectively. Additionally, large quantities of intramolecular secondary ozonides and \u03b1-acyloxyhydroperoxy aldehydes were tentatively identified as products of aqueous ozonolysis of the two unsaturated terpenoic acids investigated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry , University of Warsaw , Al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101 , Warsaw , 02-089 , Poland."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9483-4692"], "LastName": "Witkowski", "ForeName": "Bart\u0142omiej", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry , University of Warsaw , Al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101 , Warsaw , 02-089 , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al-Sharafi", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry , University of Warsaw , Al. \u017bwirki i Wigury 101 , Warsaw , 02-089 , Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gierczak", "ForeName": "Tomasz", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31296007", "10.1021/acs.est.9b02471"]}}]}
