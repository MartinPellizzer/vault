Here, we measured the psychological distance between patients and their therapists by using the Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure (PRISM).", "We analyzed the patient-therapist relationship of 112 patients from two hospitals in Japan (54 males, 57 females, 1 unknown; age 46.20 \u00b1 15.03 years [mean \u00b1 SD]) who completed the PRISM and self report questionnaires (LSNS-6, K6, and BASIS-32) about their social network, psychological distress, and outcomes of mental health treatment.", "PRISM measurements were available for all patients who consented to participate. In the comparison by disease category, schizophrenia recorded the closest distance to the psychiatrist in charge, followed by bipolar disorder, depression, and neurotic disorder. Regarding the distance to the psychiatrist in charge, PRISM showed a weak negative correlation (r = -0.23, p < 0.05) with age, indicating that with increasing age, the therapeutic rela tionship was more important to the patients.", "Our findings indicate the possibility of implementing PRISM to assess the impact of the therapeutic relationship in patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders, and they suggest that PRISM holds great potential for clinical application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Naganuma", "ForeName": "Kiyoshi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Service Center, Kurume University."}], "LastName": "Oe", "ForeName": "Misari", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Ishida", "ForeName": "Tetsuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Yudai", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Chiba", "ForeName": "Hiromi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Service Center, Kurume University."}], "LastName": "Matsuoka", "ForeName": "Michiko", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Service Center, Kurume University."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Motohiro", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kurume Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "2985210R", "ISSNLinking": "0023-5679"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology", "therapy", "diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Professional-Patient Relations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Report"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38233184", "10.2739/kurumemedj.MS6934005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
