Using the 2015 Sichuan emission inventory, source profiles based on the 1 km\u00d71 km gridded speciated VOCs emission inventory were developed, and the ozone formation potentials of the species were estimated to assess the environmental impact on ozone formation. The established VOCs source profile database consists of 45 source profiles and 519 species. Since the source profiles were established based on the revision and reconstruction of pollution sources, such as biomass burning and transportation, that are rich in OVOCs, the source profile database is better applicable to establishing the speciated VOCs emission inventory and source apportionment. The speciated VOCs emission inventory showed that the total anthropogenic emission of VOCs in Sichuan Province was 773.8 kt, of which the emissions of alkanes, olefins, alkynes, aromatics, OVOCs, halohydrocarbons, and other VOCs accounted for 21.6%, 10.0%, 1.7%, 28.0%, 26.2%, 4.2%, and 8.3% of the total respectively. The total OFP (Ozone formation potential) was 2584.9 kt, of which the OFPs of the VOCs groups mentioned above accounted for 6.9%, 26.1%, 0.5%, 42.3%, 23.2%, 0.4%, and 0.5% respectively. The main VOCs species emitted in all cities of Sichuan Province were aromatics, OVOCs, and alkanes; however, there were some significant regional differences:transportation in Chengdu, Ya'an, Aba, Ganzi, and Liangshan made a greater contribution to VOCs emissions, with alkane emissions accounting for a higher proportion in the total VOCs emission. As a heavy industrial city, Panzhihua suffered most from emissions from industrial processes, which contain a relatively high proportion of alkanes. Solvent use in Deyang, Meishan, Suining, and Ziyang made a great contribution to the VOCs emissions, and the OVOCs emission was relatively high. Emissions of VOCs and species with relatively high OFPs in Sichuan Province were mainly distributed in the Sichuan Basin, which has a dense population and highly developed industry, as well as some areas in Liangshan and Panzhihua. The main source of <i>m</i>-xylene and toluene was solvent use; therefore, <i>m</i>-xylene and toluene were relatively concentrated in developed urban areas. In addition, biomass burning contributed greatly to the emissions of ethene and formaldehyde; therefore, ethene and formaldehyde were mainly distributed in the cultivated areas of agriculturally advanced Eastern Sichuan and Southern Sichuan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zi-Hang", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Qin-Wen", "Initials": "QW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ke-Ying", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Dan-Lin", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Feng-Xia", "Initials": "FX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Key Laboratory of Air Pollution Research, Chengdu Academy of Environmental Sciences, Chengdu 610072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087901", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201809080"]}}]}
