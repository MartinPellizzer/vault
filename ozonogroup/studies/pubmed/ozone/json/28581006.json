The OH radical yields from the ozonolysis of isoprene, MACR and MVK have also been determined, as well as the gas phase stable products and their yields. The secondary organic aerosol yield for the ozonolysis of isoprene has been tentatively measured in the presence and absence of an OH radical scavenger. The measurements were performed under different experimental conditions with and without adding cyclohexane (cHX) as an OH radical scavenger. All experiments have been conducted at 760 torr of purified dry air (RH < 1%) and ambient temperature (T = 281-295 K). The data obtained are discussed and compared with those from the literature. The use of the HELIOS facility and its associated analytical equipment enables the derivation of kinetic parameters as well as mechanistic information under near realistic atmospheric conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Combustion, A\u00e9rothermique, R\u00e9activit\u00e9 et Environnement (ICARE), CNRS (UPR 3021), 1C Avenue de la Recherche Scientifique, 45071 Orl\u00e9ans Cedex 2, France. mellouki@cnrs-orleans.fr."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Yangang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grosselin", "ForeName": "Benoit", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Da\u00eble", "ForeName": "V\u00e9ronique", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "Abdelwahid", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Faraday Discuss", "NlmUniqueID": "9212301", "ISSNLinking": "1359-6640"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28581006", "10.1039/c7fd00014f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
