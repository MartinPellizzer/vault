Complementary treatment strategies have long been envisaged as a possible alternative in alleviating neck pain associated with CS; however, it is still in moderate use due to lack of adequate and convincing evidence of its safety and efficacy. The current study was to define and understand the therapeutic effects and safety of a newly developed patented technology, ozone, and laser via puncture needle, in the treatment of CS.", "The VAS score of preoperative neck and shoulder pain was (6.57\u00b11.34) scores, which decreased to 1.80\u00b10.65 at 1-week postsurgery, and was completely alleviated by the end of 1 month (VAS score 0-2 after 1, 3, and 6 mo after surgery) (Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test, H=1.680, P=0.000). VAS scores did not exhibit any significant rebound within 6 months after surgery (29 patients were excellent; 23 good; and 6 were fair, overall excellent, and good rate of 89.6%).", "Ozone and laser combined therapy via puncture needle for the treatment of CS is safe and effective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Minimally Invasive, The 316th Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Haidian District, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yuqiu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Wu", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wenli", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Spine Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "101675083", "ISSNLinking": "2380-0186"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluoroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Laser Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Neck Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Needles"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Preoperative Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Punctures"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Spondylosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Visual Analog Scale"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28525469", "10.1097/BSD.0000000000000167", "01933606-201706000-00009"]}}]}
