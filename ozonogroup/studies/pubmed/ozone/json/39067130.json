Cold plasma is an emerging antimicrobial treatment, which generates various reactive gas species and inactivates microbials effectively. The objective of this study was to explore the potential effects of combining high CO<sub>2</sub> package and in-package cold plasma (IPCP) treatments on the quality and safety of raw chicken breast meat. Noninoculated samples and samples inoculated with Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella Typhimurium were packaged in 0, 30, 70, or 100% CO<sub>2</sub> (with make-up gas N<sub>2</sub>) and treated with IPCP at 70 kV for 3 min. Ozone formation, microbial counts, drip loss, pH, and color were measured. There was no interaction effect between high CO<sub>2</sub> package and IPCP on microbial counts, drip loss, and color measurements. IPCP reduced spoilage microbial growth by 0.43 log (from 7.00 log to 6.57 log, P = 0.033) and C. jejuni populations by 0.67 log (from 4.82 log to 4.15 log, P < 0.001) on meat surface but did not affect S. Typhimurium (P = 0.206). Increased CO<sub>2</sub> in packages had more effect on spoilage microbial growth (more than 1.5 log from 8.08 log to 6.35 log, P < 0.001) and S. Typhimurium populations (more than 0.5 log from 4.94 log to 4.39 log, P = 0.004) than IPCP but did not affect C. jejuni (P = 0.163). IPCP resulted in increases in changes in L* by 1.67 units (0.70 vs. 2.37, P = 0.016) and a* values by 0.56 units (0.73 vs. 1.29, P < 0.001) and decreases in b* values by 0.91 units (0.46 versus -0.45, P = 0.015). High CO<sub>2</sub> levels caused increases in changes in L* values by 4.35 units (-0.82 versus 3.53, P < 0.001) with no effects on a* and b* values (P > 0.05). Data demonstrate that there are no combined effects by high CO<sub>2</sub> package and IPCP on meat quality and safety of raw chicken breast meat under our experimental conditions. Either high CO<sub>2</sub> package or IPCP can retain microbial quality and safety, even though they may cause changes in appearance of stored chicken breast meat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US National Poultry Research Center, USDA-ARS, Athens, GA 30605, USA.
