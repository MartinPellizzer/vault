The important indicators of air pollution include ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). This research aims to investigate the impacts of ambient air pollution (AAP), SO2, and O3 on oxidative stress parameters, liver tissue histopathology, and expression of some carcinogenesis-related genes in the hepatic tissue of rats.", "32 Wistar rats were randomly allocated to four groups: the control group, the AAP group, the SO2 group (10 ppm), and the ozone group (0.6 ppm). Over a period of five consecutive weeks, the rats were exposed to the specified pollutants for 3 h daily; liver tissues were harvested and instantly fixed with formalin. Pathological changes were assessed in the tissue samples. Additionally, the RT-qPCR technique was utilized to investigate Expression alterations of BAX, p-53, BCL2, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Furthermore, 30 milligrams of hepatic tissues were extracted to assess the activities of oxidative stress enzymes.", "The liver catalase and MDA activity were elevated in the air pollution (<i>p</i> < .05). Also, liver GPx activity in air pollution and ozone groups was significant in comparison to the control group (<i>p</i> < .05). The SO2 group exhibited severe lesions in histopathology examinations.", "The findings revealed an alteration in liver histopathology, an induction of oxidative stress, and the expression of some apoptosis-related genes in hepatic tissues after exposure to AAP, SO2, and O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48432"], "Affiliation": "Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sepehri", "ForeName": "Bita", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0009-3322-0871"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48432"], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Darbani", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48432"], "Affiliation": "Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mesgari-Abbasi", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48432"], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kheirouri", "ForeName": "Sorayya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48432"], "Affiliation": "Immunology research center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shanehbandi", "ForeName": "Dariush", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["56947"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khordadmehr", "ForeName": "Monireh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48432"], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alizadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39073095", "10.1177/09603271241263569"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
