The results showed that NMHCs were generally higher in urban areas than those in suburb and rural areas; the highest concentration of NMHCs was observed at Cangzhou High-tech zone (urban area); the concentrations of NMHCs were significantly lower at rural sites than in most urban sites except Hejian site; vehicular emissions were the main sources of NMHCs in Cangzhou; Cangzhou chemical fertilizer plant and Cangzhou oil refinery had no significant influence on urban NMHCs during their shutdown period; Dagang Oilfield, with better oil and gas recovery systems, did not have a significant impact on urban NMHCs. In general, alkanes, alkenes and aromatics accounted for 65%, 16% and 19% of NMHCs in Cangzhou City, respectively; xylene (19%), ethylene (14%), toluene(11%), propylene (5%), isopentane (5%) and isopentene (5%) were the most dominant contributors to ozone formation potential; aerosol formation potential was mainly derived from toluene (28%), pinene (28%), xylene(16%), ethylbenzene (9%) and benzene (9%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Jing-Chun", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xue-Ming", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "He-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Ji-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jing-Nan", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Fa-He", "Initials": "FH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29965079", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201608132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
