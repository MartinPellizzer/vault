From approximately 33 km float altitude, stratospheric and tropospheric limb infrared emission spectra have been recorded by this novel type of fast-scanning interferometer. Although the measured spectra did not reach the expected quality and the a priori information on the corresponding viewing directions was coarse, the data were processed successfully with a retrieval algorithm specially adapted for application to noisydata. Mixingratio profiles of ozone, nitric acid, CFC-11, and CFC-12 havebeen retrieved from limb sequences of wide spectral intervals by nonlinear least-squares fitting in combination with a layer-bylayer onion-peeling approach. A rigorous error analysis has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo calculations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clarmann", "ForeName": "T V", "Initials": "TV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oelhaf", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20856534", "10.1364/AO.32.006808", "40755"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
