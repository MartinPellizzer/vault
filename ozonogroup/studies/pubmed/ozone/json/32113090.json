Herein, Au/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared by room temperature ozone treatment. Through diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), two different gold species, Au<sup>0</sup> and Au<sup>\u03b4-</sup> with CO adsorption at about 2112\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2077\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>, were observed on Au/SBA-15. In CO oxidation mixture, the 2077\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> band is completely attenuated while the 2112\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> band retains some intensity. CO-Au<sup>\u03b4-</sup> bonding is weaker than that of CO-Au<sup>0</sup>, but CO-Au<sup>\u03b4-</sup> exhibits higher reactivity towards oxygen. Ozone treatment produces AuO<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles that is not stable and decomposes to metallic Au gradually. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to identify the presence and importance of Au<sup>\u03b4-</sup> species for \"inert\" SiO<sub>2</sub> supported gold catalyst."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
