Intravenous ozone is a modern form of alternative medicine. Even though ozone has been used medically for more than a century, ozone as an infusion is scientifically untested and potentially dangerous. This case notes a patient who underwent an ozone infusion who experienced syncope and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction immediately thereafter.", "A 50-year-old white woman presented after experiencing syncope after completion of ozone infusion therapy. The ozone infusion consisted of her blood being drawn and ozone gas being injected into the sample. This blood was subsequently transfused back into the patient's blood stream via peripheral intravenous catheter. An initial electrocardiogram revealed no signs of infarction or ischemia, but her initial troponin I was elevated and continued to rise. She was admitted for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and underwent an extensive cardiac evaluation. It was determined that the oxidative myocardial stress secondary to ozone was associated with the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: More patients are turning to alternative medicine. Unfortunately, the published literature regarding intravenous ozone exposure is scant; however, a multitude of studies have shown that ozone can have hazardous effects, including that of detrimental cardiovascular oxidative stress. Emergency physicians need to be aware of these novel treatments and their potential undetermined effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
