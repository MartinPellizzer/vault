The rate coefficient at room temperature was measured to be (1.14 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and the Arrhenius expression was derived to be <i>k</i><sub>expt</sub><sup>278-363K</sup> = (1.61 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10<sup>-13</sup> exp{(1256 \u00b1 236)/T} cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Computational calculations were performed to compute the kinetics of the titled reaction in the temperature range of 200-400 K using advanced methods incorporated with tunneling correction at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.

The feasibility of each reaction pathway was also determined using the calculated thermochemical parameters. Atmospheric implication parameters such as cumulative atmospheric lifetime and photochemical ozone creation potential were calculated and are discussed in this paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai600036, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Avinash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1285-5631"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai600036, India."}], "LastName": "Mondal", "ForeName": "Koushik", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0788-1499"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai600036, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai600036, India."}], "LastName": "Rajakumar", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34587445", "10.1021/acs.jpca.1c06590"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
