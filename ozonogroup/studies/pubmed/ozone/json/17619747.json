The aim of our work was to apply this approach and adjust it to Mediterranean environmental conditions by means of the necessary corrections. The main objective pursued was to prove the importance of soil water availability in the estimation of relative wheat yield losses as a factor that modifies the effects of tropospheric ozone on wheat, and to develop the algorithms required for the estimation of relative yield losses, adapted to the Mediterranean environmental conditions. The results show that this is an easy way to estimate relative yield losses just using meteorological data, without using ozone fluxes, which are much more difficult to calculate. Soil water availability is very important as a modulating factor of the effects of ozone on wheat; when soil water availability decreases, almost twice the amount of accumulated exposure to ozone is required to induce the same percentage of yield loss as in years when soil water availability is high."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecology Department, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. dtorre.ecol@usal.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De la Torre", "ForeName": "Daniel D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sierra", "ForeName": "Maria Jose M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ScientificWorldJournal", "NlmUniqueID": "101131163", "ISSNLinking": "1537-744X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17619747", "PMC5901188", "10.1100/tsw.2007.120"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
