This study analyzed the atmospheric VOC characteristics within an industrial coking facility and its surrounding environment. Average concentrations of total VOCs (TVOCs) in the surrounding residential activity areas (R1 and R2), the coking facility (CF) and the control area (CA) were determined to be 138.5, 47.8, 550.0, and 15.0 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The cold drum process and coking and quenching areas within the coking facility were identified as the main polluting processes. The spatial variation in VOCs composition was analyzed, showing that VOCs in the coking facility and surrounding areas were mainly dominated by aromatic compounds such as BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) and naphthalene, with concentrations being negatively correlated with the distance from the coking facility (p < 0.01). The sources of VOCs in different functional areas across the monitoring area were analyzed, finding that coking emissions accounted for 73.5%, 33.3% and 27.7% of TVOCs in CF, R1 and R2, respectively. These results demonstrated that coking emissions had a significant impact on VOC concentrations in the areas surrounding coking facility. This study evaluates the spatial variation in exposure to VOCs, providing important information for the influence of VOCs concentration posed by coking facility to surrounding residents and the development of strategies for VOC abatement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
