It is necessary to analyze the correlation between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone concentration and explore the mechanism of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone co-pollution. In order to study the characteristics of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone co-pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei with its surrounding area, ArcGIS and SPSS software were used to analyze the correlation between air quality data and meteorological data of the \"2+26\" cities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding areas from 2015 to 2021. The results indicated:\u2460 PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution constantly decreased from 2015 to 2021, and the pollution was concentrated in the central and southern parts of the region; ozone pollution showed a trend of fluctuation and presented a pattern of \"low in the southwest and high in the northeast\" spatially. In terms of seasonal variation, PM<sub>2.5</sub>concentration was mainly in the order of winter>spring \u2248 autumn>summer, and O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration was in the order of summer>spring>autumn>winter. \u2461 In the research area, days with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exceeding the standard continued to decline, whereas days with ozone exceeding the standard fluctuated, and days with co-pollution decreased significantly; there was a strong positive correlation between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone concentration in summer, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.52, and a strong negative correlation in winter. \u2462 Comparing the meteorological conditions of typical cities during the ozone pollution period with that of the co-pollution period, the co-pollution occurred under the temperature range of 23.7-26.5\u2103, humidity of 48%-65%, and S-SE wind direction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Xiao-Han", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Environment Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Environment Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Environment Planning, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Jin-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-Chen", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Tong-Lin", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environment, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Zhan-Fang", "Initials": "ZF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37040935", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202205089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
