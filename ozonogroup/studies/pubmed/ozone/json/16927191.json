Kaohsiung is a coastal industrial city with inland mountain ranges to the east. Extremely complicated ozone structures were identified that spanned day and night during the experimental period. During afternoons, the lower atmosphere was divided into two stratified air layers with substantially different ozone concentrations. On the episode day (March 26), average ozone concentration in the near-ground layer was 85 ppb and the aloft layer was 140 ppb. A very high ozone peak of 199 ppb measured aloft likely resulted from an elevated large point source. Several no-ozone air layers, distributed throughout 400-750 m, were observed to transport on shore during the night. As well, elevated ozone layers peaking at 60-90 ppb and 90-160 ppb were detected below and above the no-ozone air layers, respectively. These complicated ozone structures were likely formed through titration of plumes from large point sources and the circulations of sea breezes or combined sea-breeze/mountain flows in the study area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Science, Fooyin University, 151 Ching-Hsuen Road, Ta-Liao Hsiang, Kaohsiung Hsien 831, Taiwan, ROC. chlin@mail.fy.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ching-Ho", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Chin-Hsing", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yee-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Hsin-Chih", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Po-Hsiung", "Initials": "PH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16927191", "10.1007/s10661-006-9277-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
