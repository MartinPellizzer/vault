In western countries, industrial pollution has greatly decreased while photochemical pollution has remained stable or increased depending on the area. In animal models, all types of air pollution, at high concentration, have an effect on the airways: irritation, facilitation of allergic sensitization, reduced resistance to infections. In humans, is the prevalence of asthma higher in polluted areas? Most surveys have found that the prevalence of respiratory, ear-nose-throat, and bronchial symptoms is higher but not symptoms of asthma. The surveys comparing East and West Germany suggest that irritation (repeated rhinobronchitis) is related to acid-particle pollution. The higher prevalence of allergic diseases in ex-West Germany does not appear to be related to photochemical pollution but rather to western lifestyle in general. In addition, changes in air pollution have an effect on the clinical and functional score in asthma patients, affecting the demand for medication and health care. Of particular importance for health care is the fact that these effects occur at concentrations below \"standard\" levels of pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie-Allergologie, H\u00f4pital Nord, Marseille."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Charpin", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vervloet", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "R\u00f4le des polluants atmosph\u00e9riques dans l'asthme."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Rev Pneumol Clin", "NlmUniqueID": "8406312", "ISSNLinking": "0761-8417"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morbidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}], "NumberOfReferences": "54"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8761636"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
