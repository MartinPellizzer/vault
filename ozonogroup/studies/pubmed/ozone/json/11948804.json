Recent reports that refer to the high sensitivity of DAF-2 toward NO prompted us to test its efficiency and specificity in a mixed murine primary glial culture model, in which the NO-synthesizing enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Cultures were loaded with DAF-2DA and the fluorescence was measured using confocal microscopy. NO production in the cultures was determined using the ozone/chemiluminescence technique. Due to the extremely high photosensitivity of DAF-2, low laser intensities were used to avoid artifacts. No difference in DAF-2 fluorescence was observed in NO-producing cultures compared to control cultures, whereas the NO/peroxynitrite-sensitive dye 2,7-dihydrodichlorofluorescein (DCF) showed a significant fluorescence increase specifically in microglia cells. A detectable gain in fluorescence was seen when NO-containing buffer was added to the DAF-2DA-loaded cells with a minimum NO concentration at 7.7 microM. An additional gain of DAF-2 fluorescence was obtained when the cells were depleted of glutathione (GSH) with L-buthionine S,R-sulfoximine (BSO). Hence, we monitored the change in DAF-2 fluorescence intensity in the presence of NO and O(-*)(2) in a cell-free solution. The fluorescence due to NO was indeed larger when O(-*)(2) was added, implying a higher sensitivity of DAF-2 for peroxynitrite. Nevertheless, our results also indicate that measurement of DCF fluorescence is a better tool for monitoring intracellular changes in the levels of NO and/or peroxynitrite than DAF-2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Otto-von-Guericke University, Institute for Medical Neurobiology, Magdeburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roychowdhury", "ForeName": "Sanjoy", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luthe", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keilhoff", "ForeName": "Gerburg", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "Gerald", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horn", "ForeName": "Thomas F W", "Initials": "TF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Glia", "NlmUniqueID": "8806785", "ISSNLinking": "0894-1491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluoresceins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14691-52-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxynitrous Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2044-85-1", "NameOfSubstance": "diacetyldichlorofluorescein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos2 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TPY09G7XIR", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell-Free System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluoresceins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Confocal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroglia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxynitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11948804", "10.1002/glia.10024", "10.1002/glia.10024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
