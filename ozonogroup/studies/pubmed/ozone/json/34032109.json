In this study, we summarized the relationship between relative crop yield or woody plant biomass and O<sub>3</sub> metrics, including M7 (the mean of hourly concentrations from 09:00 to 16:00), SUM06 (sum of hourly concentrations above 60 nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>), W126 (Sigmoidal weighted sum of the hourly concentrations during a specified period), POD<sub><i>Y</i></sub>[phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose above a threshold flux of <i>Y</i> nmol\u00b7(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s)<sup>-1</sup>], and the most commonly used AOT40 (accumulated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over an hourly threshold of 40 nmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>), and proposed their critical level to protect plants against O<sub>3</sub> damage. Based on the AOT40 metric, we found that the O<sub>3</sub> risk threshold that caused a 5% decrease in yield was 5.93 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h for rice, 2.69 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h for winter wheat, 8.67 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h for maize, and 4.17 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h for soybean, indicating that maize may be more tolerant to O<sub>3</sub> than the other three crops in China. The O<sub>3</sub> risk threshold that led to a 5% reduction in total biomass was 12.20 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h across five poplar clones (based on experiment) and 10.87 \u03bcmol\u00b7mol<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7h across 17 woody plants (based on integrated analysis). On the other hand, some perspectives were presented concerning the establishment of O<sub>3</sub> response relationships for important productivity-related parameters, and the improvement of accuracy in O<sub>3</sub> regional risk assessment. It is also important to consider how to couple other important factors affecting plant O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity (such as soil nitrogen and plant age) into the regional assessment model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Agrometeorology of Jiangsu Province, School of Applied Meteorology, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Zhao-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101408, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jin-Long", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34032109", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202009226"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
