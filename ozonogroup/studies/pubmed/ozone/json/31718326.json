Because of the disadvantages of fumigants, we evaluated alternative microwave and ozone methods for their disinfection and the side effects on raisin qualities. To perform microwave disinfection, the studied raisin samples were exposed to microwave powers of 450, 720, and 900 W for 20, 30, 40, and 50 s. Also, ozone treatments included various combinations of ozone concentrations (2, 3, and 5 ppm) and exposure times (15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min). An image processing technique was implemented to determine the color changes of raisins in terms of lightness, redness, yellowness, total color difference, chroma, and hue angle. The results revealed that increasing the microwave power and exposure time might lead to further changes of the previously mentioned color characteristics. Compared with the microwave treatments, ozone treatments had fewer effects on those features. Generally, microwave and ozone methods could successfully disinfect <i>Oryzaephilus surinamensis</i> in raisins, with acceptable changes in all the color characteristics. Hence, the previously mentioned methods are proposed as alternative chemical fumigants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, College of Abureihan, University of Tehran, Tehran 3391653755, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zabol, Zabol 98613-35856, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seyedabadi", "ForeName": "Esmaeel", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, College of Abureihan, University of Tehran, Tehran 3391653755, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moghaddam", "ForeName": "Rahil Mirabi", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Preserved"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31718326", "10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-19-296", "S0362-028X(22)10717-9"]}}]}
