It was confirmed that the waveform of a Group Mean SEP and of a Group SD each converges to a waveform different from a flat horizontal line. The waveform of the Group Mean SEP consisted of 12 components, and was roughly tetraphasic within 500 msec in latency. Large discrepancies were found in the later components between the Group Mean SEP and the Group Schematic SEPs reported by others, although some coincidences were shown in the early components within 100 msec in latency. The results derived from the Scaled SEPs, which were converted from the (unscaled) SEPs, indicated the possibility of a reduction of the data by the Amplitude Scaling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikuta", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furuta", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Unzai", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niki", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Folia Psychiatr Neurol Jpn", "NlmUniqueID": "0372774", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5721"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evoked Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Somatosensory Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7262727", "10.1111/j.1440-1819.1980.tb02455.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
