The enhancement and optimization of APT was done by applying low O(3) doses during coagulation. By applying an ozone dose of 2 mg/L during APT, the required coagulant dose may be reduced by up to 25% to achieve a similar turbidity removal (and up to 50% for total suspended solids removal), when compared to a conventional APT treatment. When the same coagulant dose was applied (60 mg/L), the volume of settleable solids was reduced from 31.0 to 25.5 mL/L, and the settling velocity increased from 0.111 to 0.139 m/min. Disinfection was also improved by the use of ozone, which leads to better plant germination rates than when using chlorination, because of reduced toxicity of the ozonated effluents. Additionally, helminth eggs content was reduced by applying ozone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright IWA Publishing 2008."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Institute de Ingeniera, Edificio 5, 1er Nivel, Cub 214, Circuito Escolar, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510 Mexico DF, Mexico. acamposrealesp@ii.unam.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Campos-Reales-Pineda", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orta de Vel\u00e1squez", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rojas-Valencia", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Helminths"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasite Egg Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18413959", "10.2166/wst.2008.204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
