In recent years, PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in China has decreased significantly, whereas that of O<sub>3</sub> has increased rapidly, leading to considerable health risks. In this study, a generalized additive model was employed to establish the relationship of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> exposure with non-accidental mortality across 17 districts and counties in Jilin Province, China, over 2015-2016. The health burden and economic losses attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were assessed using high-resolution satellite and population data. According to the results, per 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations related to an overall relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 1.004 (1.001-1.007) and 1.009 (1.005-1.012), respectively. In general, the spatial distribution of mortality and economic losses was uneven. Throughout the study period, a total of 23,051.274 mortalities and 27,825.015 million Chinese Yuan (CNY) in economic losses were attributed to O<sub>3</sub> exposure, which considerably surpassing the 5,450.716 mortalities and 6,553,780 million CNY in economic losses attributed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure. The O<sub>3</sub>-related health risks and economic losses increased by 3.75% and 9.3% from 2015 to 2016, while those linked to PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased by 23.33% and 18.7%. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that changes in pollutant concentrations were the major factors affecting mortality rather than baseline mortality and population."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
