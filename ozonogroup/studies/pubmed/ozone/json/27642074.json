Although energy consumption doubled from 2004 to 2014 and vehicle number significantly increased from 2006 to 2014, ambient SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were reduced by 66%, 20% and 24%, respectively, mainly due to emissions control efforts. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> increased by 19%. Model simulations of three emission control scenarios, including a baseline (a case in 2010), a CAP (a case in 2020 assuming control strength followed past control tendency) and a REF (a case in 2020 referring to the strict control measures based on recent policy/plans) were conducted to investigate the variations of air pollutants to the changes in NO<sub>x</sub>, VOCs and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions. Although the area mean concentrations of NO<sub>x</sub>, nitrate and PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased under both NO<sub>x</sub> CAP (reduced by 1.8%, 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively) and NO<sub>x</sub> REF (reduced by 7.2%, 1.8% and 0.3%, respectively), a rising of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was found in certain areas as reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions elevated the atmospheric oxidizability. Furthermore, scenarios with NH<sub>3</sub> emission reductions showed that nitrate was sensitive to NH<sub>3</sub> emissions, with decreasing percentages of 0-10.6% and 0-48% under CAP and REF, respectively. Controlling emissions of VOCs reduced PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the southwestern PRD where severe photochemical pollution frequently occurred. It was also found that O<sub>3</sub> formation in PRD was generally VOCs-limited while turned to be NO<sub>x</sub>-limited in the afternoon (13:00-17:00), suggesting that cutting VOCs emissions would reduce the overall O<sub>3</sub> concentrations while mitigating NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the afternoon could reduce the peak O<sub>3</sub> levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
