By different experimental design, furthermore, the contribution of these factors for transfer efficiency was investigated respectively. The results show that the mixed liquor height h and bubble diameter d impacted the mass transfer efficiency of ozone more significantly, as compared to the other factors of sludge concentration, input gas concentration and observed gas velocity u(obs). When mixed liquor height h was 0.2 m, the ozone gas utilization U was only 0.45; when h was 0.8 m, U increased to 0.883; when h was 1.4, U was almost up to 1. The U and h show strong index relationship. For mixed liquor with h 0.8 m, when bubble diameter d decreased from 0.007 5 to 0.005, U increased from 0.89 to 0.96, and, for mixed liquor with h 0.6 m, similar increase from 0.8 to 0.93 was observed. According to the acquired experimental data, a quantitative expression among mass transfer efficiency U, mixed liquor height h and mean bubble diameter d, with R2 equal to 0.861 6, was finally obtained, as a reference tool for project design."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Pollution Control Research Centre, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. mezwang@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bao-Zhen", "Initials": "BZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yi-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Ge-Fu", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17926397"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
