Exposures to 0.2 and 0.4 ppm O3 caused a significant increase in the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activity and cytochrome P-450 content in a dose-dependent manner during 4-12 weeks, whereas NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was not altered. After 12 weeks of exposure to 0.4 ppm O3, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 reached a maximum showing 138 (P less than 0.001) and 221% (P less than 0.001) those of the control levels, respectively. At 0.1 ppm O3, the cytochrome P-450 content still increased significantly to 152% that of the control on the fourth week. In parallel to the increment of cytochrome P-450 benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase increased significantly during 4-12 weeks of exposures to 0.2 and 0.4 ppm O3. After a 4-week exposure to 0.1 and 0.2 ppm O3, benzphetamine N-demethylase increased to the largest degree among the enzymes metabolizing four kinds of xenobiotics examined. 7-Ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase also increased significantly but of smaller magnitude, whereas coumarin hydroxylase was not affected. These results show that prolonged exposures to 0.1-0.4 ppm O3 persistently enhance pulmonary cytochrome P-450 systems. It is also suggested that some isozyme(s) of pulmonary cytochrome P-450, especially that catalyzing benzphetamine N-demethylation, are preferentially increased by exposure to low levels of O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0147621", "ISSNLinking": "0013-9351"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3569183", "10.1016/s0013-9351(87)80210-4", "S0013-9351(87)80210-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
