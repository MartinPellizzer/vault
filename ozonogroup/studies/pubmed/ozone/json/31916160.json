It is a small molecule and recalcitrant compound that is difficult to remove by conventional processes and in this regard, there is a need for the development of new technologies. In this study, an innovative CuO-coated ceramic membrane (CM) reactor system that can be used to oxidize 1,4-dioxane dissolved in surface water by catalytic ozonation was developed. The effect of the thickness of the CuO deposited on the ceramic membrane surface on the permeability, fouling resistance, 1,4-dioxane removal, and toxicity was evaluated. The efficiency of the hybrid ozonation coupled to the use of a CuO-coated CM in 1,4-dioxane removal and the antifouling properties were assessed from TOC and 1,4-dioxane removal kinetics data. Reusability in four cycles was also tested. The performance of the CuO-coated CM remained stable during the four cycles of the reusability test. The ceramic membrane coated with CuO particles coupled with ozonation is appropriate for 1,4-dioxane degradation in the aqueous phase (45% efficiency, rate constant increased by a factor of 2.98 compared with the uncoated-hybrid process) and fouling removal (60\u00a0min to recovery the permeate flux)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1992-2916"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Scaratti", "ForeName": "Gidiane", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "De Noni J\u00fanior", "ForeName": "Agenor", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Jos\u00e9", "ForeName": "Humberto Jorge", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Food Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. regina.moreira@ufsc.br."}], "LastName": "de Fatima Peralta Muniz Moreira", "ForeName": "Regina", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J8A3S10O7S", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-dioxane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1XJQ704R4", "NameOfSubstance": "cupric oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dioxanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31916160", "10.1007/s11356-019-07497-6", "10.1007/s11356-019-07497-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
