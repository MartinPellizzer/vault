Within experimental uncertainties the uptake of NO(3) was not sensitive to the presence of water vapour ( <0.5% relative humidity). [corrected]. NO(3) uptake experiments involving substrates of levoglucosan, abietic acid, and the mixture exhibit an initial strong uptake of NO(3) followed by NO(3) gas-phase recovery as a function of NO(3) exposure. In contrast, the uptake of NO(3) by nitroguaiacol continuously proceeds at the same efficiency for investigated NO(3) exposures. The derived oxidative power, i.e. the product of \u03b3 and atmospheric oxidant concentration, for applied oxidants is similar or significantly larger in magnitude than for OH, emphasizing the potential importance of these oxidants for particle oxidation. Estimated atmospheric lifetimes for the topmost organic layer with respect to O(3), NO(2), N(2)O(5), and NO(3) oxidation for typical polluted conditions range between 1-112 min, indicating the potential for significant chemical transformation during atmospheric transport. The contact angles determined prior to, and after heterogeneous oxidation by NO(3), representative of 50 ppt for 1 day, do not decrease and thus do not indicate a significant increase in hygroscopicity with potential impacts on water uptake and cloud formation processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Terrestrial and Planetary Atmospheres/School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University, Nicolls Road, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.
