In this study, effects of Br<sup>-</sup> on NDMA formation during ozonation of UDMH were studied, meanwhile, its promotion pathways were also determined. The results demonstrated that Br<sup>-</sup> promoted NDMA formation from UDMH during ozonation, the formation rate constant with Br<sup>-</sup> is over 7 times of that without Br<sup>-</sup>. NDMA amount raised from 142.5 to 327.5 \u03bcg/L when Br<sup>-</sup> dosages increased from 0 to 100 \u03bcM. No matter with or without Br<sup>-</sup>, the augment of O<sub>3</sub> dosages facilitated NDMA formation; the maximum value was achieved at pH 8. NDMA decreased dramatically from 173.8 to 123.5 \u03bcg/L with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> raising from 0 to 160 \u03bcM, while increasing remarkably to 222.5 \u03bcg/L with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> dosing. In addition, NOM inhibited NDMA formation from UDMH during ozonation. The mass spectrum of LC-MS/MS verified that the generation of Br-UDMH was main cause for promoting NDMA formation. Moreover, hypobromous acid (HBrO) was confirmed to be responsible for Br-UDMH formation. In addition, the position that oxidants and Br<sup>-</sup> attacked was demonstrated based on Gaussian calculation. The results of this study could provide theoretical basis for the application of ozonation in bromine-containing water matrixes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
