The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is located in the world's high-value area of lightning density, and lightning-generated NO<sub>x</sub> (LNO<sub>x</sub>) cannot be ignored. Using the flash data from Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Lightning Location System and multi-site atmospheric composition data, we estimate the NO<sub>x</sub> variations in lightning activity and its impact on O<sub>3</sub> across the PRD region. The cloud-to-groud (CG) frequency from 2013 to 2021 shows a decreasing trend driven by urban regions. We observe that the lightning density is steadily decreasing from the south-central part of Guangzhou City to the surrounding area. A comparison of the different sites with lightning days and non-lightning days shows that a significant amount (13. 84-20. 47\u00a0%) of ground-level NO<sub>x</sub> concentration at urban stations can be attributed to lightning NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. A lower lightning frequency and low background concentration observed at suburban sites indicated a limited contribution of LNO<sub>x</sub>. The average decrease in O<sub>3</sub> concentration at urban stations (15.92-25.06\u00a0%) was significantly higher than that at suburban stations (5.34-8.95\u00a0%) due to the influence of titration and lower actinic radiation. There was a greater fluctuation in NO<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during the cases, and the surface NO<sub>x</sub> concentration displayed the most significant responsiveness to LNO<sub>x</sub> under direct lightning striking in the tall tower. This phenomenon has not been reported, however, it is consistent with the laboratory-based observations suggesting the amount of LNO increases with peak current. LNO<sub>x</sub> significantly impacts air quality in the PRD during the high convective season. Further in situ and vertical distribution observations are necessary to explore the ground-level impact of LNO<sub>x</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
