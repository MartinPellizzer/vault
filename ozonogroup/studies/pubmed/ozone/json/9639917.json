To determine a biologically weighted dose rate accurately, a reasonable wavelength resolution is required, involving a full radiative transfer solution to be performed for each wavelength in order to obtain the surface flux information. If biologically weighted dose rates are needed as a function of ozone variation, then the number of radiative transfer solutions quickly makes a large number of ozone variations cumbersome. This paper shows that the perturbation theory developed for atmospheric radiative transfer by Box and co-workers can predict surface fluxes and hence biologically weighted dose rates for a large range of ozone variations very efficiently. The method is then extended to calculate radiation amplification factors. Results for biologically weighted dose rates are presented for a large range of solar zenith angles and ozone loadings using perturbation theory and a full radiative transfer code and show that the perturbation predictions never deviate very far from the radiative transfer solutions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Physics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loughlin", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Box", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematical Computing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9639917", "10.1016/S1011-1344(98)00091-8", "S1011-1344(98)00091-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
