Once the relative yield losses are calculated by means of the two approaches, the aim is to establish which index (the exposure-response index or the accumulated uptake index) best characterizes the response of wheat plants to ozone. The relative yield losses are compared considering two watering regimes: well watered and nonwatered. The results obtained show that the relative yield losses in wheat due to ozone exposure are much more strongly linked to the real quantity of ozone absorbed by plants than to the environmental ozone exposure, which means that the accumulated uptake approach is much more realistic than the exposure-response approach. Relative yield loss estimations were higher in a crop with no watering; 3% of relative yield losses more than a crop watered until field capacity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Plant Biology Department, ETSI Agronomos, Madrid, Spain. daniel.delatorre@upm.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De la Torre", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ScientificWorldJournal", "NlmUniqueID": "101131163", "ISSNLinking": "1537-744X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20098954", "PMC5763924", "10.1100/tsw.2010.26"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
