We consider the hypothesis that reactions taking place within indoor boundary layers result in greater than anticipated hydroxyl radical (OH) deposition rates. We develop models that account for boundary layer mass-transfer phenomena, O<sub>3</sub> -terpene chemistry and OH formation, removal, and deposition; we solve these analytically and by applying numerical methods. For an O<sub>3</sub> -limonene system, we find that OH flux to a surface with an O<sub>3</sub> reaction probability of 10<sup>-8</sup> is 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup> molec/(cm<sup>2</sup> s) which is about 10 times greater than predicted by a traditional boundary layer theory. At very low air exchange rates the OH surface flux can be as much as 10% of that for O<sub>3</sub> . This effect becomes less pronounced for more O<sub>3</sub> -reactive surfaces. Turbulence intensity does not strongly influence the OH concentration gradient except for surfaces with an O<sub>3</sub> reaction probability >10<sup>-4</sup> . Although the O<sub>3</sub> flux dominates OH flux under most conditions, OH flux can be responsible for as much as 10% of total oxidant uptake to otherwise low-reactivity surfaces. Further, OH chemistry differs from that for ozone; therefore, its deposition is important in understanding the chemical evolution of some indoor surfaces and surface films."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
