The mean concentrations (11:00-15:00) of the observed OH and HO<sub>2</sub> radicals were 9.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> and 9.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>\u00a0cm<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. To investigate the state-of-the-art chemical mechanism of radical, closure experiments were conducted with a box model, in which the RACM2 mechanism updated with the latest isoprene chemistry (RACM2-LIM1) was used. In the base run, OH radicals were underestimated by the model for the low-NO regime, which was likely due to the missing OH recycling. However, good agreement between the observed and modeled OH concentrations was achieved when an additional species X (equivalent to 0.25\u00a0ppb of NO mixing ratio) from one new OH regeneration cycle (RO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0X\u00a0\u2192\u00a0HO<sub>2</sub>, HO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0X\u00a0\u2192\u00a0OH) was added into the model. Additionally, in the base run, the model could reproduce the observed HO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Discrepancies in the observed and modeled HO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were found in the sensitivity runs with HO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneous uptake, indicating that the impact of the uptake may be less significant in Chengdu because of the relatively low aerosol concentrations. The ROx (= OH\u00a0+\u00a0HO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0RO<sub>2</sub>) primary source was dominated by photolysis reactions, in which HONO, O<sub>3</sub>, and HCHO photolysis accounted for 34%, 19%, and 23% during the daytime, respectively. The efficiency of radical cycling was quantified by the radical chain length, which was determined by the NO to NO<sub>2</sub> ratio successfully. The parameterization of the radical chain length may be very useful for the further determinations of radical recycling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
