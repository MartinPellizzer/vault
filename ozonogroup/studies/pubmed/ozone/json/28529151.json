Mental nerves of 27 rats were partly sutured and allocated into 3 groups. Group 1 received no treatment, group 2 received OT, and group 3 received PBM. The number of fascicules beyond nerve branches and the number of SCs before and after nerve injury were evaluated histologically.", "A better healing pattern was observed in the treatment groups. The number of SCs was markedly larger in the OT and PBM groups than in the control group.", "Oral and maxillofacial surgeons should be familiar with the differential diagnosis, prevention, and management of neurosensory disturbances. This study provides insights into the management of neurosensory disturbances related to mental nerve injury using OT and PBM. This study clearly suggests that OT and PBM are promising novel methods for the treatment of mental nerve injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.
