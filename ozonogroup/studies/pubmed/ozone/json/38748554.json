Herein, we combined theoretical calculations with experimental verifications to comprehensively investigate the O<sub>3</sub> activation mechanisms on a series of conventional SAC structures with N-doped nanocarbon substrates (MN<sub>4</sub>-NCs, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The synergetic manipulation effect of the metal atom and M-OH on O<sub>3</sub> activation pathways was paid particular attention. O<sub>3</sub> tends to directly interact with the metal atom on MnN<sub>4</sub>-NC, FeN<sub>4</sub>-NC, and NiN<sub>4</sub>-NC catalysts, among which MnN<sub>4</sub>-NC has the best catalytic activity for its relatively lower activation energy barrier of O<sub>3</sub> (0.62 eV) and more active surface-adsorbed oxygen species (O<sub>ads</sub>). On the CoN<sub>4</sub>-NC catalyst, direct interaction of O<sub>3</sub> with the metal site is energetically infeasible, but O<sub>3</sub> can be activated to generate O<sub>ads</sub> or HO<sub>2</sub> species from direct or indirect participation of M-OH sites. The experimental results showed that 90.7 and 82.3% of total organic carbon (TOC) was removed within 40 min during catalytic ozonation of <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid with MnN<sub>4</sub>-NC and CoN<sub>4</sub>-NC catalysts, respectively. Phosphate quenching, catalyst characterization, and EPR measurement further supported the theoretical prediction. This contribution provides fundamental insights into the O<sub>3</sub> activation mechanism on SACs, and the methods and ideals could be helpful for future studies of environmental catalysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Guangfei", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhaomeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5968-9357"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hongbin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yiqiu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5592-9883"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Data Center, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Process Pollution Control, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yongbing", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38748554", "10.1021/acs.est.4c00812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
