The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and sensitive method for recovery of NoVs by using a filtration concentration method followed by PCR amplification for detection of NoVs from cheese and fresh lettuce. Experimentally, a fecal suspension containing different number of NoVs copies was spiked in the food surface and extracted by a direct elution using a Stomacher apparatus. An Ozone-Safe solvent Vertrel XF treatment was included for cheese samples for removing particulate matter. The watery phase was collected and the viral concentration was performed by the adsorption-elution method using negatively charged membranes with inorganic solvents in a Stericup and afterwards ultrafiltered using a Centriprep Concentrator 50 to obtain a final volume of 2ml. RNA isolation was carried out with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit available commercially and reverse transcription was carried out with a Pd(N6) random primer. Real time quantitative PCR (TaqMan) and qualitative PCR were used for molecular detection of NoVs. The recovery rate of NoVs ranged from 5.2 to 72.3% in lettuce and from 6 to 56.3% in cheese. The results indicate that this method is suitable for detection of NoVs contamination in food and will help establish the cause and source of NoVs outbreaks of food-borne illness."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Comparative Virology, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fumian", "ForeName": "Tulio Machado", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leite", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Paulo G", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marin", "ForeName": "Victor Augustus", "Initials": "VA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miagostovich", "ForeName": "Marize Pereira", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Virol Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "8005839", "ISSNLinking": "0166-0934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Cheese"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastroenteritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Norovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18951920", "10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.09.026", "S0166-0934(08)00355-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
