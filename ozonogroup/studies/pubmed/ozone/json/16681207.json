Measurements for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass, sulfate (SO4(2-)), nitrate (NO3-), black carbon (BC), particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and meteorological data (wind speed, wind direction, temperature [T], relative humidity [RH], and solar radiation) were used to determine the causes of nanoparticle (3-10 nm) and ultrafine (10-100 nm) particle events. These events were found to be divided into four types: (1) 3- to 10-nm morning nucleation; (2) 10- to 30-nm morning traffic; (3) 10- to 30-nm afternoon photochemical; and (4) 50- to 84-nm evening home heating, including residential wood combustion. Intense examples of the first type (>10(4) number [#]/cm3) were observed on 29 days, nearly always during the summer. The second type of event was observed on more than 73 days and occurred throughout the year. The third type was observed on 36 days, from spring through summer. The fourth type was found on 109 days, all of them during the winter. Although sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in Central California are low, the small residual amounts in gasoline and diesel fuel are apparently sufficient to initiate nucleation events. These were measured in the morning, soon after the shallow surface inversion coupled with layers aloft where nucleation probably was initiated. PM2.5 concentrations were poorly correlated with nanoparticle number."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Desert Research Institute, 2215 Raggio Parkway, Reno, NV 89512, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watson", "ForeName": "John G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chow", "ForeName": "Judith C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Kihong", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lowenthal", "ForeName": "Douglas H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Kihong", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hazardous Waste"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hazardous Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16681207", "10.1080/10473289.2006.10464526"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
