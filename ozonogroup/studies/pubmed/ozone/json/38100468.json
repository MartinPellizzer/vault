Heat wave was defined as extreme high temperature for at least two consecutive days. Grid-level heat waves were defined by multiple combinations of apparent temperature thresholds and durations. Residential O<sub>3</sub> and heat wave exposures were assessed using grid data sets (spatial resolution: 1 km \u00d7 1 km for O<sub>3</sub>; 0.0625\u00b0 \u00d7 0.0625\u00b0 for heat wave). Conditional logistic regression models were applied for exposure-response analyses and evaluation of additive interactions. Under different heat wave definitions, the odds ratios (ORs) of CVD mortality associated with medium-level and high-level O<sub>3</sub> exposures ranged from 1.029 to 1.107 compared with low-level O<sub>3</sub>, while the ORs for heat wave exposure ranged from 1.14 to 1.65. Significant synergistic effects on CVD mortality were observed for the O<sub>3</sub> and heat wave exposures, which were generally greater with higher levels of the O<sub>3</sub> exposure, higher temperature thresholds, and longer durations of heat wave exposure. Up to 5.8% of the CVD deaths were attributable to O<sub>3</sub> and heat wave. Women and older adults were more vulnerable to the exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and heat wave exposure. Exposure to both O<sub>3</sub> and heat wave was significantly associated with an increased odds of CVD mortality, and O<sub>3</sub> and heat wave can interact synergistically to trigger CVD deaths."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5339-0653"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University,
