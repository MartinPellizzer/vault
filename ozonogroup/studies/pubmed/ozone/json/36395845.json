However, the current studies on the quantification of HCHO impacts on atmospheric photochemistry in southeast coastal areas of China with an obvious upward trend of ozone remain scarce and unclear, thus limiting the full understanding of formation mechanism and control strategy of photochemical pollution. Here, systematic field campaigns were conducted at a typical coastal urban site with good air quality to reveal HCHO mechanism and effects on O<sub>3</sub> pollution mechanism during spring and autumn, when photochemical pollution events still frequently appeared. Positive Matrix Factorization model results showed that secondary photochemical formation made the largest contributions to HCHO (69 %) in this study. Based on the photochemical model, the HCHO loss rates in autumn were significantly higher than those in spring (P < 0.05), indicating that strong photochemical conditions constrain high HCHO levels in certain situations. HCHO mechanism increased the ROx concentrations by 36 %, and increased net O<sub>3</sub> production rates by 31 %, manifesting that the reduction of HCHO and its precursors' emissions would effectively mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Therefore, the pollution characteristics and photochemical effects of HCHO provided significant guidance for future photochemical pollution control in relatively clean areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
