Maximum incremental reactivity(MIR) and fractional aerosol coefficient(FAC) were employed to evaluate the ozone formation potential(OFP) and secondary organic aerosol(SOA) formation potential. The results show that the VOC types emitted from the manufacturing of rubber products mainly include alkanes, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and benzene series. For traditional rubber products manufactured through rubber mixing and vulcanization, the main pollutants are ketones and alcohols, whereas for production processes involving gluing and painting, the main pollutants belong to the benzene series. In terms of ozone impact, the traditional processes contribute to ozone formation mainly through oxygenated hydrocarbons. In industries that utilize adhesives and paints, the extensive use of these organic solvents lead to a significantly higher contribution of the benzene series than other VOC species to ozone formation; the benzene series account for 82.9% of the total contribution. In terms of SOA impact, the benzene series are the main contributor to SOA, whereas the contribution of VOCs from traditional processes is small; hence, SOA primarily originates from the gluing and painting processes. Therefore, in traditional production of rubber products through rubber mixing and vulcanization, the emission of oxygenated hydrocarbons should be preferentially controlled, whereas for rubber industries utilizing gluing and painting processes, the emission of benzene series should be preferentially controlled."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hai-Lin", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hengshui Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Sciences, Hengshui 053000, China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Guo-Xing", "Initials": "GX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hengshui Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Sciences, Hengshui 053000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Li-Min", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Run", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-04-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Rubber"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rubber"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34708958", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202103145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
