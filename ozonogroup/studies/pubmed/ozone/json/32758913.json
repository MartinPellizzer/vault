In this study, a response surface methodology-central composite design was applied to investigate the significant process variables (temperature, light intensity, inoculum density and light period) and its interaction effect on biomass yield of effluent acclimatized microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata, Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana in ozone pre-treated tannery effluent (OPTE). At optimum culture condition N. oculata, C. vulgaris, and C. sorokiniana have yielded 0.67\u00a0g/L, 0.85\u00a0g/L, and 1.06\u00a0g/L biomass. Besides, correlation and regression analysis revealed the strong correlation between microalgal growth and nutrient removal rate. Among the species, C. sorokiniana has shown better remediation potential, at 27.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 150\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> light intensity, 30% (v/v) inoculum, 16\u00a0h light period with the specific growth rate of 0.559 day<sup>-1</sup> and nutrient/pollutant removal efficiency of 90% C, 90% N, 100% P, 82% COD, and 100% chromium. But, N. oculata has revealed the better lipid accumulation potential (40%) in OPTE. Thus, the present study established the appropriate strains and conditions required for OPTE treatment along with the value-added biomass production in large scale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
