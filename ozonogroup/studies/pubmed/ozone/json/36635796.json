The results showed that the volume fraction of VOCs decreased with the increase in height (72.1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\u00b128.1\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>-56.4\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\u00b124.8\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>). Alkanes at all heights accounted for the largest proportion (68%-75%), followed by aromatics (10%-12%), halohydrocarbons (10%-11%), alkenes (3%-7%), and acetylene (2%). The diurnal variation of the boundary layer had a great influence on the VOCs profile. The lower boundary layer in the morning and evening caused the volume fraction of VOCs to accumulate near the ground and lower in the upper layer. The vertical distribution of VOCs was more uniform in the afternoon. In the morning, the volume fraction proportion of alkenes (alkanes) with strong (weak) photochemical reactivity decreased (increased) with the increase in height, indicating that the photochemical aging of VOCs in the upper layer was significant. In the afternoon, the vertical distribution of VOCs volume fraction and OFP in the lower troposphere were more uniform. Affected by the surrounding air masses with different sources, the volume fraction and component proportion of VOCs at each height were significantly different. The alkanes in rural air masses were vertically evenly distributed, and the proportion increased gradually with the height. The vertical negative gradient of VOCs volume fraction in the urban air mass was the largest, the volume fraction of VOCs near the ground was high, and it was rich in aromatics. The proportion of aromatics increased with the increase in VOCs volume fraction between 200-400 m height of industrial air mass. The near-surface VOCs volume fraction of the highway traffic air mass was high, and alkanes accounted for the largest proportion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Outfield of National Comprehensive Meteorological Observation Special Experiment, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tai", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Outfield of National Comprehensive Meteorological Observation Special Experiment, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Outfield of National Comprehensive Meteorological Observation Special Experiment, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Shuang-Shuang", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210044, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Outfield of National Comprehensive Meteorological Observation Special Experiment, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jun-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry(LAPC), Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Gui-Qian", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Climate Center, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jia-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36635796", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202202133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
