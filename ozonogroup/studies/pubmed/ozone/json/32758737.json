Indicator substances are a great help and a cost-efficient way in monitoring the pollution of water bodies with OMPs caused by the discharge of WWTPs. However, with the still increasing number of OMPs in our environment, the selection of suitable indicator substances presents a challenge. A concept was developed to help identify representative indicator substances. The derived indicator substances are not only used to assess water pollution, but can also be used to calculate elimination efficiencies of WWTPs. In the present investigations, the indicator substances were used to evaluate the reduction of OMPs in the water body on the basis of the expansion of a WWTP with an ozonation plant. The transferability of the tool was verified with a second WWTP. Furthermore, the impact of the number of measurements was analysed via statistical combinatorics. With the tool, 36 substances were classified, leading to the identification of 9 suggested indicator substances. Among them ibuprofen and diclofenac attracted attention due to their ecotoxicological relevance. Detailed data analyses were carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) and loads."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
