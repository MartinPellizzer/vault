Herein, different Co-based oxides are controllably synthesized including hexagonal wurtzite CoO-W with Co<sup>2+</sup> in tetrahedral coordination (Co<sub>Td</sub><sup>2+</sup>) and CoAl spinel with dominant Co<sub>Td</sub><sup>2+</sup>, cubic rock salt CoO-R with Co<sup>2+</sup> in octahedral coordination (Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>2+</sup>), MgCo spinel with dominant Co<sup>3+</sup> in octahedral coordination (Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>3+</sup>), and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with mixed Co<sub>Td</sub><sup>2+</sup> and Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>3+</sup>. The valences are proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the coordinations are verified by X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. The ozone decomposition performances are Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>3+</sup> \u223c Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>2+</sup> \u226b Co<sub>Td</sub><sup>2+</sup>, and Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>3+</sup> and Co<sub>Oh</sub><sup>2+</sup> show a lower apparent activation energy of \u223c42-44 kJ/mol than Co<sub>Td</sub><sup>2+</sup> (\u223c55 kJ/mol). In specific, MgCo shows the highest decomposition efficiency of 95% toward 100 ppm ozone at a high space velocity of 1,200,000 mL/gh, which still retains at 80% after a long-term running of 36 h at room temperature. The high activity is explained by the d-orbital splitting in the octahedral coordination, favoring the electron transfer in ozone decomposition reactions, which is also verified by the simulation. These results show the promising prospect of the coordination tuning of Co-based oxides for highly active ozone decomposition catalysts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
