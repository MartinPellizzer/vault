One commonly used method of disposing of this waste is landfarming. Landfarming involves spreading hydrocarbon waste on soils, tilling it into the soil, and allowing it to biodegrade. We used a dynamic flux chamber to measure fluxes of methane, a suite of 54 nonmethane hydrocarbons, and light alcohols from an active and a remediated landfarm in eastern Utah. Fluxes from the remediated landfarm were not different from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheet or from undisturbed soils in the region. Fluxes of methane, total nonmethane hydrocarbons, and alcohols from the landfarm in active use were 1.41 (0.37, 4.19) (mean and 95% confidence limits), 197.90 (114.72, 370.46), and 4.17 (0.03, 15.89) mg\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0hr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Hydrocarbon fluxes were dominated by alkanes, especially those with six or more carbons. A 2-ha landfarm with fluxes of the magnitude we observed in this study would emit 95.3 (54.3, 179.7) kg\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup> of total hydrocarbons, including 11.2 (4.3, 33.9) kg\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup> of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes).", "Solid and sludgy hydrocarbon waste from the oil and gas industry is often disposed of by landfarming, in which wastes are tilled into soil and allowed to decompose. We show that a land farm in Utah emitted a variety of organic compounds into the atmosphere, including hazardous air pollutants and compounds that form ozone. We calculate that a 2-ha landfarm facility would emit 95.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a066.0\u00a0kg\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup> of total hydrocarbons, including 11.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0kg\u00a0day<sup>-1</sup> of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bingham Entrepreneurship & Energy Research Center , Utah State University , Vernal , UT , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , Utah State University , Logan , UT , USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8493-9522"], "LastName": "Lyman", "ForeName": "Seth N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Bingham Entrepreneurship & Energy Research Center , Utah State University , Vernal , UT , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , Utah State University , Logan , UT , USA."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1233-7594"], "LastName": "Mansfield", "ForeName": "Marc L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29652219", "10.1080/10962247.2018.1459327"]}}]}
