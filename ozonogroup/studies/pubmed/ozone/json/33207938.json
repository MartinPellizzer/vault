Though unit operations employed in domestic and industrial-scale processing of foods such as high-temperature decontamination and chemical washings degrade the agrochemicals and reduce toxicity, eliminating pesticides from the fresh and raw fruits and vegetables with the retainment of nutritional and organoleptic attributes demand appropriate non-thermal technologies. In this review, the potential of novel technologies like the pulsed electric field, high-pressure processing, irradiation, ozone, ultrasonication, and cold plasma for the reduction of pesticides in fruits and vegetables have been discussed in terms of their mechanism of action, playing around factors, advantages, and limitations. All the reviewed non-thermal technologies exhibited promising effects on pesticide degradation with their unique mechanism of action. Also, these techniques' potential to reduce the pesticides below MRLs and yield nontoxic metabolites in fruits and vegetables were analyzed. However, investigating the impact of the technologies on the nutritional and organoleptic quality profile of the commodities at the processing conditions causing noticeable pesticide reduction and the pathways of degradation reactions of various pesticides with each emerging technology should be studied to enhance the applicability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Non-Thermal Processing, Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, India."}], "LastName": "T K", "ForeName": "Ranjitha Gracy", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Non-Thermal Processing, Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, India."}], "LastName": "P S", "ForeName": "Sharanyakanth", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Non-Thermal Processing, Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, India."}], "LastName": "Radhakrishnan", "ForeName": "Mahendran", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33207938", "10.1080/10408398.2020.1847029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
