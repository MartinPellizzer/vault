Geometries for low-lying singlet and triplet states of ozone were optimized by CCSD(T) and density functional theory (DFT) (with BPW91 functional) methods. DFT geometries were found to lie close to CCSD(T) values. Most CCSD(T) and DFT geometries and energies are in good agreement with available experimental and recent high-level theoretical values, with deviations lying within 0.02 A, 2 degrees, and 0.3 eV. An exception is the 1 (1)B(2) state, having a larger deviation of bond distance and energy. A multiconfigurational treatment is required for this state. DFT geometry optimizations and calculations of vibrational frequencies were extended to higher states, covering over 30 excited states of ozone, with adiabatic excitation energies up to about 6 eV. Calculated harmonic frequencies showed several states, including 1 (1)B(2), to be saddle points. Multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) bending potentials for first and second singlet and triplet states were used in verifying the CCSD(T) and DFT geometries and for locating additional minima. For first states, DFT bending potentials are compared with MRCI potentials. As a criterion for the quality of single-determinant geometries and energies of excited states, comparison of their vertical excitation energies with MRCI or time-dependent DFT values is recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Laser, Atomic and Molecular Sciences, University of New Brunswick, P.O.
