We investigated the pre-treatment of 2-BMW with HA, coupled with ozonation in this study. Our results indicated that the removal rate of these key TOMs and the detoxification rate reached almost 100% and 46.3%, respectively, by ozonation under only 0.099\u00a0mg\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>/mg chemical oxygen demand (COD). The organic load rate (OLR) reached 10.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0kg COD/m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7d, and the acidification degree (AD) and detoxification efficiency reached 56.0% and 98.3%, respectively, with enhancements of 35.1% and 55.2%, respectively, compared with HA alone. The removal rate of the three key TOMs was improved by >\u00a075%. The degradation pathways of these key TOMs were ring cleavage and ester formation by ozonation, followed by fermentation and acid production by HA. Ultimately, the synergistic role of ozonation and HA was revealed. The preferential cleavage of these key TOMs by ozonation was achieved because of their high electron cloud density and multiple reaction sites, which generated more fermentation-friendly products. The fermentation and acid production reactions may be directly involved in these products. Functional bacteria and key metabolic pathways were also enhanced by ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
