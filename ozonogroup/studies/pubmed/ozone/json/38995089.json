A multicity time series study was conducted to investigate the synergistic effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on mortality in China, using mortality data and high-resolution pollutant predictions from 272 cities in 2013-2015. Generalized additive models were applied to estimate associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> with mortality. Modification and interaction effects were explored by stratified analyses and synergistic indexes. Deaths attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were evaluated with or without modification of the other pollutant. The risk of total nonaccidental mortality increased by 0.70% for each 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> when O<sub>3</sub> levels were high, compared to 0.12% at low O<sub>3</sub> levels. The effect of O<sub>3</sub> on total nonaccidental mortality at high PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels (1.26%) was also significantly higher than that at low PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels (0.59%). Similar patterns were observed for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. The relative excess risk of interaction and synergy index of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on nonaccidental mortality were 0.69% and 1.31 with statistical significance, respectively. Nonaccidental deaths attributable to short-term exposure of PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> when considering modification of the other pollutant were 28% and 31% higher than those without considering modification, respectively. Our results found synergistic effects of short-term coexposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on mortality and suggested underestimations of attributable risks without considering their synergistic effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education
