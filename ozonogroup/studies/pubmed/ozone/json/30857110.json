The annual magnitude, monthly variations and diurnal patterns of isoprene emissions are estimated. The annual emissions of isoprene were estimated to be 23.2Gg with an uncertainty of 120%. This falls within the range of previous emission inventories (EI; 3.8Gg to 36.3Gg between 1990 and 2010). Strong isoprene emissions were observed between May and September. The biggest difference was the isoprene emissions in May, with contributions of 23.3% to total annual emissions using box model estimates compared with 3.7% in EI. The diurnal profiles of isoprene emissions estimated in this study were generally similar to those in the EI, with the highest emissions occurring during mid-day (11:00-13:00). However, obvious differences were found for the growth rates and decreasing rates of isoprene emissions in the morning and afternoon respectively. Compared to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the isoprene emissions contributed half (49.5%) of the total ozone formation potential (OFP) at 13:00 in August, which highlights the importance of isoprene in ozone formation. This study helps bound the isoprene emissions estimated by EI despite the inherent large uncertainty."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
