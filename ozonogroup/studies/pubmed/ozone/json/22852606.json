Jagau and J. Gauss, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 044115 (2012)] is employed to determine vertical excitation energies within the singles and doubles approximation (Mk-MRCCSD-LR) for ozone as well as for o-benzyne, m-benzyne, and p-benzyne, which display increasing multireference character in their ground states. In order to assess the impact of a multireference ground-state wavefunction on excitation energies, we compare all our results to those obtained at the single-reference coupled-cluster level of theory within the singles and doubles as well as within the singles, doubles, and triples approximation. Special attention is paid to the artificial splitting of certain excited states which arises from the redundancy intrinsic to Mk-MRCC theory and hinders the straightforward application of the Mk-MRCC-LR method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie, Universit\u00e4t Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany. jagau@uni-mainz.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jagau", "ForeName": "Thomas-C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gauss", "ForeName": "J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22852606", "10.1063/1.4734309"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
