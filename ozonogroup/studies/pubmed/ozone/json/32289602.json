Compared with the conventional coagulation process and pre-ozonation-coagulation process, much better organic matter removal performance can be achieved for both the Al-HOC and Fe-HOC processes. The Fe-HOC process showed an obviously higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiency than that of the Al-HOC process. Surface hydroxyl groups were determined to be the active sites in generating OH in the HOC process, and the hydrolysed Fe species possessed a higher content of surface hydroxyl groups than the hydrolysed Al species according to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analyses. In addition, the hydrolysed Fe species contained a higher portion of tetrahedral sites that were more likely to be stronger Lewis acid sites to react with ozone to generate OH. Furthermore, peroxone reactions in the HOC process were other possible way to enhance the OH generation, and higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation was observed in the Fe-HOC process due to higher O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation. Therefore, better removal performance of the Fe-HOC process can be obtained due to the increased OH generation in the Fe-HOC process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
