Removal ratios correlated with the numbers of halogen elements contained in PUHs (isoproturon <sub>(0)</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0chlorotoluron <sub>(1 Cl)</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0diuron <sub>(2 Cl)</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0fluometuron <sub>(3\u00a0F)</sub>), and the degradation efficiencies of oxidants from fastest to slowest were: O<sub>3</sub>, ClO<sub>2</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub>. NDMA can be generated directly from the ozonation of PUHs. Further, compared with chloramination alone, ozonation prominently promoted NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) during post-chloramination, and NDMA-FPs increased approximately 23-68 times than those during ozonation only at 2.5\u00a0mg/L O<sub>3</sub> over 10\u00a0min; molar yields of NDMA from highest to lowest were 11.1% (isoproturon), 1.17% (chlorotoluron), 1.0% (diuron), and 0.73% (fluometuron). The PUH degradation kinetics data during ozonation agreed with the pseudo-first-order model. The rate constant k<sub>obs</sub> were 0.31\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup>-19.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. The k<sub>obs</sub> and removal ratios of PUHs during ozonation partially scaled with the mass, LogK<sub>ow</sub>, and Henry's constants of PUHs. Comparisons of measured NDMA-FPs with calculated NDMA-FPs from residual PUH after oxidation showed that the intermediates produced during ozonation facilitated NDMA-FPs; this contribution was also observed for chlorotoluron and isoproturon during ClO<sub>2</sub> oxidation. Examination of reaction mechanisms revealed that tertiary amine ozonation, N-dealkylation, hydroxylation, the cleavage of N-C bonds, ammonification, and nitrification occurred during the ozonation of PUHs, and the dimethylamine (DMA) functional groups could be decomposed directly and transformed into NDMA via the formation of the intermediate unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine. NDMA is also formed from the reaction between DMA and phenylamino-compounds. Clarifying primary degradation products of PUHs and transformation pathways of NDMA during oxidation processes is useful to optimize treatment processes for water supplies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
