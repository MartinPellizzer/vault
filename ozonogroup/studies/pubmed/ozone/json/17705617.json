These patterns have a characteristic wavelength, lambda approximately 3H, where H is the film thickness. We show that these random structures can be ordered, modulated, and aligned by depositing the elastic film (cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane) on a patterned substrate and by bringing the free surface of the film in increasing adhesive contact with a flat stamp. Interestingly, the influence of the substrate \"bleeds\" through the film to its free surface. It becomes possible to generate complex two-dimensional ordered structures such as an array of femtoliter beakers even by using a simple one-dimensional stripe patterned substrate when the instability wavelength, lambda approximately 3H, nearly matches the substrate pattern periodicity. The free surface morphology is modulated in situ by merely varying the stamp-surface separation distance. The free surface structures originating from the elastic contact instability can also be made permanent by the UV-ozone induced oxidation and stiffening."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur 208 016, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukherjee", "ForeName": "Rabibrata", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pangule", "ForeName": "Ravindra C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ashutosh", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "Indrani", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17705617", "10.1063/1.2752499"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
