On 2018 emission condition, 30% precursor reduction simulations presented the positive contribution of VOCs and the negative contribution of NO<sub>x</sub> to daytime O<sub>3</sub>. The occurrence probabilities of VOCs-sensitive, NO<sub>x</sub>-titration, mixed sensitive, NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive, and non-sensitive regimes respectively reached 3-49%, 2-82%, 0-7%, 0-6% and 14-82% in the urban grids, and 2-32%,1-19%, 1-6%, 0-5% and 54-86% in the rural grids. For several widely used photochemical indicators, their values in VOCs-sensitive regime were well separated from those in NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive regime, but the NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive values were very similar to the non-sensitive values, which implied the inefficiency of these indicators in indicating NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive regime. Finally, VOCs-sensitive regime was discerned based on the indicator HCHO/NO<sub>2</sub>, occupying about a third of areas in morning and dusk but shrinking to about a tenth of areas in 11:00-16:00 in BTH. And these areas apparently decreased from 2014 emission to 2018 emission. However, the rest areas of this region were under non-sensitive regime but not NO<sub>x</sub>-sensitive regime, for the noticeable O<sub>3</sub> drop never happened in NO<sub>x</sub> reduction scenario. Meanwhile, the modeled O<sub>3</sub>/PAN in the areas under non-sensitive regime exceeded 60, which also implied the minor impact of local photochemistry on O<sub>3</sub> there. Additionally, the responses of daytime O<sub>3</sub> to precursor emissions in the urban grids were calculated, declining by 20.8% for NO<sub>x</sub> and 6.9% for VOCs from 2014 to 2018. Therefore, to solve the ozone pollution problem of BTH, the cross-region strategy coupled with the VOCs and NO<sub>x</sub> co-control will be essential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
