Intermittent fog in the same geographical area can be acidic with high concentrations of nitric acid. Results from recent field studies in the Los Angeles Basin have emphasized the relative toxicity of these components of photochemical air pollution. Studies have focused on gaseous+fog or gaseous+dry particulate effects on conifers, gaseous+fog effects on crops, and the effects of trace pollutants produced during generation of ozone on crops. Data from these studies indicate that direct alterations in growth and physiological responses were observed only with gaseous pollutants (primarily ozone), or repeated applications of highly acidic fogs (pH < 2.7). Direct particle dry deposition effects are unclear. Few interactions have been found between gaseous pollutants and acidic fog. Charcoal-filtered open-top chambers are highly effective in removing pollutants in the following order: fog (100%) > peroxyacetyl nitrate > ozone > nitrogen dioxide > sulfur dioxide > nitrate ion > ammonium ion > sulfate ion. However, nitric oxide concentrations are higher in charcoal-filtered chambers than in ambient air. The studies point out the importance of considering other components of photochemical pollution in addition to ozone, especially when investigating subtle, long-term effects on vegetation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olszyk", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bytnerowicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takemoto", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092372", "10.1016/0269-7491(89)90259-5", "0269-7491(89)90259-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
