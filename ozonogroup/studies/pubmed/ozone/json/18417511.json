IL-13(-/-), IL-4/13(-/-) and IL-13-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice were exposed to ozone (3 ppm; 3 h) or air. Wild-type (Wt) Balb/c mice and transgenic-negative littermates (IL-13Wt) were used as controls for gene-deficient and IL-13Tg mice, respectively. IL-4/13(-/-) and IL-13(-/-) mice developed a lesser degree of ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) while IL-13Tg mice developed a greater degree of AHR compared with ozone-exposed wild-type or IL-13Wt mice, respectively. Ozone caused a time-dependent increase of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophils and macrophages in wild-type mice, maximal at 20-24 h, which was attenuated in the IL-13(-/-) and IL-4/13(-/-) mice. In IL-13Tg mice, there was a greater increase in BAL neutrophils after ozone exposure compared with IL-13Wt mice. Using quantitative real-time PCR, ozone-induced mRNA expression for IL-6 and keratinocyte chemokine was further enhanced in IL-13(-/-) and IL-4/13(-/-) mice, and was inhibited in IL-13Tg mice. Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3alpha/CCL20 expression was enhanced after ozone exposure in wild-type mice, inhibited in IL-13(-/-) and IL-4/13(-/-) mice, while in IL-13Tg mice it was enhanced. A similar pattern of expression was observed with lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine (LIX/CXCL5/ENA-78) expression. In conclusion, interleukin-13 augments ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and neutrophilic inflammation, possibly through modulation of certain cytokines induced by ozone exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Experimental Studies, Airway Disease Section, National Heart & Lung Institute, Guy Scadding Building, Dovehouse St., London SW3 6LY, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nath", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leung", "ForeName": "S-Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khorasani", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKenzie", "ForeName": "A N J", "Initials": "AN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adcock", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "MC_U105178805", "Acronym": "MRC_", "Agency": "Medical Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"Acronym": "WT_", "Agency": "Wellcome Trust", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chemokine CCL20"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-13"}, {"RegistryNumber": "207137-56-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chemokine CCL20"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-13"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Transgenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18417511", "10.1183/09031936.00121607", "09031936.00121607"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
