Gas chromatographic measurement of head space gas from incubation tubes containing leaves or seedlings was a simple method of simultaneously measuring all four compounds. Increased ethylene production had two phases, a moderate increase from the beginning of the stress period and a large increase just prior to appearance of leaf lesions. Ethane production in SO(2)-stressed plants did not increase until lesions appeared. Acetaldehyde and ethanol production began within 6 hours at 0.3 microliter per liter SO(2) and 24 hours at 0.1 microliter per liter SO(2) and continued throughout a 6-day fumigation. Production of acetaldehyde and ethanol continued when plants were removed to clean air for up to 2 days. A higher concentration of SO(2) (0.5 microliter per liter) induced acetaldehyde and ethanol production within 2 hours of the start of fumigation of birch and pine seedlings. A number of other stresses, including water deficit, freezing, and ozone exposure induced production of acetaldehyde and ethanol. Production of these compounds was not due to hypoxia, as the O(2) partial pressure in the incubation vessels did not decline. Increasing the O(2) partial pressure to 300 millimeters Hg did not affect production of these compounds. Production of ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethanol declined when more than 80% of the leaf area became necrotic, while ethane production was linearly related to the percentage of necrosis. A number of woody and herbaceous plant species produced acetaldehyde and ethanol in response to freezing stress, while others did not. Measurement of these four compounds simultaneously in the gas phase may be a valuable method for monitoring plant stress, particularly air pollution stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kimmerer", "ForeName": "T W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kozlowski", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Jan;63(1):142-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16660667"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 May;67(5):990-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16661807"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1981 Mar;67(3):424-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16661687"]}, {"Citation": "Atmos Environ. 1976;10(11):969-74", "ArticleIdList": ["1008919"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 May;63(5):924-30", "ArticleIdList": ["16660838"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 Mar;59(3):521-2", "ArticleIdList": ["16659885"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Ind. 1967 Mar 25;12:486-97", "ArticleIdList": ["5342641"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1978 Feb 27;528(2):213-21", "ArticleIdList": ["623777"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16662306", "PMC426315", "10.1104/pp.69.4.840"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
