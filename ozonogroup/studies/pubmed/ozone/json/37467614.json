VUV-O<sub>3</sub> treatment was beneficial in terms of decolorization (100%), chemical oxygen demand removal (43.29%), and total organic carbon removal (54.81%). The VUV-O<sub>3</sub> process was applicable over a wide pH range, and the presence of various anions had no significant influence on the oxidation efficiency. After treatment, the genotoxicity, unsaturation degree, and polarity of the SE decreased. In addition, the oxidation sensitivities of the fluorescent organic compounds were ranked as follows: humic acid-like >\u00a0tyrosine-like >\u00a0fulvic acid-like >\u00a0tryptophan-like Moreover, the VUV-O<sub>3</sub> process effectively converted refractory organic matter (molecular weights, MW > 2000\u00a0Da) into short-chain molecules with low MWs. The removal efficiency of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was 63.27%, and 77.27% of the DOM was found to be reactive to VUV-O<sub>3</sub> oxidation. The unsaturation, polarity, and compositional complexity of the DOM decreased after VUV-O<sub>3</sub> treatment. Finally, it was deduced that the direct O<sub>3</sub> oxidation,\u00b7OH, O<sub>2</sub>\u00b7<sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> played a role in the VUV-O<sub>3</sub> oxidation process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
