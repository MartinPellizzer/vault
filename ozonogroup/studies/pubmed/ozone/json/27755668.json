An approach for regional-scale ecological risk assessment is described and demonstrated by modeling environmental risks associated with elevated ozone in a forested region. The demonstration illustrates (1) how a regional-scale risk assessment might be done, (2) the importance of spatial characteristics in considering regional-scale risk, and (3) the necessity of considering terrestrial and aquatic linkages. Generic problems often encountered when doing regional assessments, the foremost of which is the frequent lack of region-specific information and spatial data, are also highlighted. In the demonstration, two levels of elevated ozone and five different at-risk regional features are considered (forest cover, forest edge, forest interior, landscape pattern, and lake water quality). The mechanism for impacts on these features is ozone-induced stress in coniferous trees, patches of which can then be killed by bark beetle attacks. A stochastic spatial model of land-cover change is developed to evaluate the risks or probabilities of significant changes in the selected ecological features as a consequence of these ozone-triggered beetle attacks. Risk to regional water quality of lakes is evaluated by linking the land-cover output from the spatial stochastic model to an empirical water-quality model that is sensitive to land-cover changes within a lake's watershed. The risk analysis shows that those environmental features that are sensitive to the location of coniferous forest (such as forest edge) are at risk of a significant change due to ozone-induced conifer mortality even though overall coniferous forest cover is only slightly affected. The analysis also suggests a high probability of changes in regional water quality of lakes as a consequence of location-specific forest-cover change."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 1991 by the Ecological Society of America."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hunsaker", "ForeName": "C T", "Initials": "CT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Neill", "ForeName": "R V", "Initials": "RV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jackson", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ecol Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9889808", "ISSNLinking": "1051-0761"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27755668", "10.2307/1941812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
