This may also lead to developing antibiotic resistance, teratogenic, carcinogenic, and endocrine-disrupting effects. However, several PPCPs are also considered biologically active for non-target aquatic organisms, such as mosquito fish, goldfish, and the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Various physicochemical methods such as ozonation, photolysis, and membrane separation are recognized for the effective removal of PPCPs. However, the high operation and maintenance costs and associated ecological impacts have limited their further use. Constructed wetlands are considered eco-friendly and sustainable for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products together with antibiotic resistance genes. Several mechanisms such as sorption, biodegradation, oxidation, photodegradation, volatilization, and hydrolysis are occurring during the phytoremediation of PPCPs. During these processes, more than 50% of PPCPs can be eliminated through constructed wetlands. They also offer several additional benefits as obtained macrophytic biomass may be used as raw material in pulp and paper industries and a source for second-generation biofuel production. In this study, we have discussed the origin and impacts of PPCPs together with their treatment methods. We have also investigated the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with constructed wetlands during the treatment of wastewater laden with pharmaceutical and personal care products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
