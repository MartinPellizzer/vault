Total particle number concentration and size distribution were monitored by a condensation particle counter and a scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. UFPs were emitted from all three products under indoor relevant ozone concentrations (~ 17 ppb). LE showed a nucleation burst followed by a relatively stable and continuous emission while the other two products (NI and BS) showed episodic emissions. The estimated maximum particle emission rate varied from 5.4 \u00d7 10(9) to 1.2 \u00d7 10(12) particles/min and was directly related to the dose of mosquito repellent used. These rates are comparable to those due to other indoor activities such as cooking and printing. The emission duration for LE lasted for 8-78 min depending on the dose applied while the emission duration for NI and BS lasted for 2-3 h.", "Certain essential-oil-based mosquito repellents can produce high concentrations of UFPs when applied, even at low ozone levels. Household and personal care products that contain essential oil may need to be tested at indoor relevant ozone levels to determine their potential to increase personal UFP exposures."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
