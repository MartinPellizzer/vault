The conventional characterization test showed that the Mn-Fe binary oxides (Mn/FeO<sub>x</sub>) with the crystal structure of FeMnO<sub>3</sub> were successfully loaded on the membrane and the catalytic performance of Mn-Fe-CM for O<sub>3</sub> was apparently enhanced as compared to CM. Consequently, compared with O<sub>3</sub> oxidation alone, the degradation and mineralization efficiencies of TMP in the O<sub>3</sub>/Mn-Fe-CM system were both improved and 98.6% of TMP could be removed within 10\u00a0min. The degradation efficiency of TMP decreased with the increasing pH and the addition of Cl<sup>-</sup>\u3001HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\u3001PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, while humic acid (HA) exhibited negative effect on the TMP removal. Radical scavenger experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis confirmed that direct oxidation by O<sub>3</sub> played an important role in the degradation of TMP, while hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> also participated. Fe(II) could act as an intermediate to transfer electrons and accelerate the transformation of Mn(III) to Mn(II) and Mn(IV) to Mn(III) during the ozonation process, which definitely strengthened the synergic catalytic effect of Mn-Fe-CM. The proposed degradation mechanism of TMP mainly contained hydroxylation, carbonylation, demethoxylation and deamination. Due to the strong catalytic ozonation performance for organic pollutants degradation, the O<sub>3</sub>/Mn-Fe-CM system revealed better anti-membrane fouling ability, strong cyclic usage performance and high applicability for the actual surface water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
