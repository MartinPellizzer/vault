The authors review recent literature linking carbon allocation and host/fungal response under natural and anthropogenic stress, and present a conceptual model to discuss how carbon may be involved in singular and multiple stress interactions of mycorrhizal seedlings. Due to an integral integral role in metabollic processes, characterizing carbon allocation in controlled laboratory environments could be useful for understanding host/fungal responses to a variety of natural and anthropogenic stresses. Carbon allocation at the whole-plant level reflects an integrated response which links photosynthesis to growth and maintenance processes. A root-mycocosm system is described which permits spatial separation of a portion of extramatrical hyphae growing in association with seedling roots. Using this system, it is shown that root/hyphal respiratory release of pulse-labeled 14C follows a sigmoidal pattern, with typical lag, exponential and saturation phases. Total respiratory release of 14C per mg root and the fraction respired of total 14C allocated to the root is greater in ponderosa pine inoculated with Hebeloma crustuliniforme than in noninoculated controls. Results illustrate the nature of information than can be obtained using this system. Current projects using the mycocosms include characterizing the dynamics of carbon allocation under ozone stress, and following the fate of organic pollutants. The authors believe that the system could be used to differentiate fungal- and host-mediated responses to a large number of other stresses and to study a variety of physiological processes in mycorrhizal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US EPA Environmental Research Laboratory, 200 SW 35th Street, Corvallis, Oregon, 97333, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Andersen", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rygiewicz", "ForeName": "P T", "Initials": "PT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092079", "10.1016/0269-7491(91)90051-w", "026974919190051W"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
