There is an urgent need to find other suitable products to replace them and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are considered to be the most probable candidates as CFC alternatives. The HCFCs and HFCs are more susceptible to decomposition during use than CFCs because they contain hydrogen. Toxicological data on these alternative fluorocarbons are being developed. A systematic investigation of these compounds has been undertaken to establish the fragmentation patterns. Electron impact mass spectra are reported for HCFCs and HFCs. Fragmentation mechanisms are presented and discussed on the basis of variable energy (11 to 30 eV) spectra. At low ionization energy, it is possible to describe an order of fragmentation for each compound. This may lead to the possibility of classifying them according to characteristic behaviors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche sur le M\u00e9dicament de Normandie, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Caen France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reizian", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dat", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rault", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robba", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7529163", "10.1016/0147-6513(94)90029-9", "0147-6513(94)90029-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
