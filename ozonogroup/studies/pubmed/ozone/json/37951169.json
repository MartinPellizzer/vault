In this study, the synergistic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by VUV and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was explored via developing a novel integrated VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process, and the performance and mechanisms of VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS for levofloxacin (LEV) degradation were investigated systematically. Results indicated that VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS could effectively degrade LEV, and the degradation rate was 1.67-18.79 times of its sub-processes. Effects of PMS dosage, O<sub>3</sub> dosage, solution pH, anions, and natural organic matter on LEV removal by VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS were also studied. Besides, hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical were main ROS with contributions of 49.7% and 17.4%, respectively. Moreover, the degradation pathways of LEV in VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process were speculated based on density functional theory calculation and by-products detection. Furthermore, synergistic reaction mechanisms in VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process were proposed. The energy consumption of VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS decreased by 22.6%-\u00a088.1% compared to its sub-processes. Finally, the integrated VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS process showed satisfactory results in removing LEV in actual waters, manifesting VUV/O<sub>3</sub>/PMS had great application potential and feasibility in removing organics in wastewater reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
