However, the potential mechanisms remain uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate whether ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) regulates synaptic plasticity through PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway and induces neurobehavioral modifications among the young rats. In vivo, the newborn rats were used to construct the animal model of early postnatal O<sub>3</sub> treatment. In vitro, this study measured the effect of different concentrations of serum from O<sub>3</sub> treated rats on the viability of the PC12 cells, and investigated the modifications of synaptic plasticity and PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway in the hippocampus and PC12 cells after O<sub>3</sub> treated. The results revealed significant depression-like behavior and increased hippocampal histopathological damage in the young rats after O<sub>3</sub> treated. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of synaptic related proteins including Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin and PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3\u03b2 were decreased in the O<sub>3</sub> treated group. In vitro assays, a significant reduction in Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin, PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3\u03b2 was found in PC12 cells after O<sub>3</sub> serum treated. While 740Y-P (a specific PI3K activator) administered, the expression levels of Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin, PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3\u03b2 in the 740Y-P\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> group were significantly elevated in vivo and vitro compared with the O<sub>3</sub>-only group. In addition, miRNAs modulating PIK3R1 were screened on bioinformatics website, the study found aberrant expression of miR-221-3p in the hippocampus and serum of O<sub>3</sub> treated group. Inhibition of miR-221-3p expression effectively reversed the reduction of Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin, PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3\u03b2 in PC12 cells induced by O<sub>3</sub> treatment. Altogether, these studies indicate that O<sub>3</sub> restrained the expression of PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway and impaired synaptic plasticity that resulted in depressive-like behavior in young rats. Moreover, miR-221-3p plays an important role in this procedure by regulating PIK3R1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
