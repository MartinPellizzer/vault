Atmospheric emissions of both MDI and TDI are low, both in terms of concentration and mass, because of their low volatility and the need for careful control over all aspects of their lifecycle from manufacture through disposal. Typical emission losses for TDI are 25 g/t of TDI used in slabstock foam production. MDI emission losses are lower, often less than 1 g/t of MDI used. Dispersion modeling predicts that concentrations at the fenceline or beyond are very low for typical releases. Laboratory studies show that TDI (and by analogy MDI) does not react with water in the gas phase at a significant rate. The primary degradation reaction of these aromatic diisocyanates in the atmosphere is expected to be oxidation by OH radicals with an estimated half-life of one day. Laboratory studies also show that this reaction is not expected to result in increased ground-level ozone accumulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gilbert International Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom. bernard@gilbertinternational.co.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tury", "ForeName": "Bernard", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pemberton", "ForeName": "Denis", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bailey", "ForeName": "Robert E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isocyanates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17X7AFZ1GH", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene 2,4-Diisocyanate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B0LO6BBS8C", "NameOfSubstance": "4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Isocyanates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene 2,4-Diisocyanate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12568254", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466120"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
