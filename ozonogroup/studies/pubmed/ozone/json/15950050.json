Ozone concentrations and standard meteorological variables were measured in June and July 2002. A smoothed ozone hourly cycle was obtained with mean values of 120 and 110 microgm(-3) during day-time and night-time, respectively. The highest ozone concentrations were recorded in the SE-S-SW wind sectors, proving the influence of transport from the Madrid urban plume to the upper plateau. This assumption was also supported by the satisfactory correlation between ozone peaks obtained at the monitoring site and those recorded in a representative station on the foothill located on the lower plateau during episodic situations. To assess the contribution of long-range transport, backward air mass trajectories were computed each day of measurements at 820 hPa. The lowest ozone mean was linked to Atlantic Ocean air masses, and the highest to air masses from Central Europe."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Valladolid, Valladolid 47071, Spain. marisa@latuv.uva.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Torre", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15950050", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.12.079", "S0045-6535(05)00120-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
