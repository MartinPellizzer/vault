Karst. exposed to three different concentrations of ozone for four seasons (1985-8) in open-top chambers. The treatments were non-filtered air+ozone (NF+), non-filtered air (NF) and charcoal-filtered air (CF). The measurements were made on shoots of four different age classes. No significant effects were found on photosynthesis or on leaf conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> in current year shoots. In 1- to 3-yr-old shoots, leaf conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> and rates of net photosynthesis at both 330 \u03bcmol mol<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>n</sub> 330), and saturating concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> (P<sub>n</sub> max), decreased with increasing shoot age and ozone concentration, although this was only significant for P<sub>n</sub> 330 in 3-yr-old shoots. In current year shoots the intercellular concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was significantly higher in NF+-treated shoots compared with CF- and NF-treated shoots, while in the 2- and 3-yr-old shoots it was significantly higher in NF- and NF +-treated shoots compared with CF-treated shoots. The carboxylation efficiency significantly decreased in 2- and 3-yr-old shoots from the NF and NF+ treatments compared with shoots from the CF treatment. The gas phase limitation of photosynthesis decreased with increasing shoot age and ozone concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, University of G\u00f6teborg, Carl Skottsbergs gata 22, S-413 19 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wallin", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, University of G\u00f6teborg, Carl Skottsbergs gata 22, S-413 19 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ottosson", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, University of G\u00f6teborg, Carl Skottsbergs gata 22, S-413 19 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swedish Environmental Research Institute (IVL), Box 47086, S-402 58 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selld\u00e9n", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Arnon, D.
