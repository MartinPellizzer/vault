As the prevalence of kidney disease increases, understanding the role of environmental agents on the health of dialysis patients is critical to reducing global morbidity and mortality.", "We identified 16 publications that investigated associations between pollutants including particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and ozone (O 3 ) and health outcomes among dialysis patients. Eight studies examined the effects of particulate matter (PM) and four studies examined the effects CO exposure on dialysis patients. Exposure to PM was consistently associated with outcomes including all-cause mortality and a smaller body of literature suggested relationships with subclinical outcomes. Exposure to CO was associated with all-cause mortality, generalized inflammation, and uremic pruritus. An additional four studies examined multiple pollutant exposures including NO 2 , SO 2 , and O 3 and reported associations with all-cause mortality in dialysis patients.", "This review emphasized the nascent literature that demonstrates consistent relationships between air pollutant exposure and adverse outcomes among dialysis patients.
