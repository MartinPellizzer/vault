Estimated heavy metals during the experimental campaign were mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and arsenic (As). The average heavy metal concentrations for the first site (Spata) constituted 0.66-14.7ng/m(3) for the summer period and 0.14-19.5ng/m(3) for the winter period. At the second site (Koropi), the corresponding values varied between 0.89 and 13.3ng/m(3) and 0.16 and 24.7ng/m(3), respectively. PM(10) Hg, PM(10) Cd and PM(10) Ni contents showed regular daily variations, with higher mass percentages during the summer, indicating differences in local PM(10) sources for each season. On the contrary, PM(10) Pb presented higher mass percentages during the winter. Examination of the relationship between heavy metals and meteorological parameters indicated a higher correlation with temperature and relative humidity, especially for Pb. In addition, most of the heavy metals (apart from Hg) presented an expected correlation with nitrate oxides (NO(x)), PM(10) and ozone (O(3)). Higher correlations with both meteorological parameters and gaseous pollutants were observed during the winter experimental campaign. Maximum heavy metal concentrations at both sites were observed during days with NE or NNE prevailing winds during the summer campaign, while the winter period was characterized with maximums during days with W or WNW prevailing winds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Research Laboratory/INT-RP, National Centre for Scientific Research DEMOKRITOS, Aghia Paraskevi Attikis, P.O.B. 60228, 15310 Athens, Greece. chvasil@ipta.demokritos.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vassilakos", "ForeName": "Ch", "Initials": "Ch"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veros", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michopoulos", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maggos", "ForeName": "Th", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Connor", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17126484", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.11.002", "S0304-3894(06)01339-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
