Because some air pollutants would produce oxidative stress, increase serum IgE, and trigger T-helper type 2 (Th2)-type airway inflammation, the associations of FcepsilonRIbeta polymorphism with wheezing illness may vary by their exposures and variants of oxidant defence genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of FcepsilonRIbeta E237G polymorphism with wheezing illness and to determine whether these associations vary with air pollution and glutathione S-transferase (GST) P1-105 and M1 genotypes.", "In 2001, we conducted a case-control study comprised of 214 children with any history of wheezing and 185 non-wheezing controls, all of whom were selected from 2558 fourth- to ninth-grade schoolchildren in southern Taiwan. We examined differences in associations with ambient air pollution and by GST genotypes.", "Compared with the FcepsilonRIbeta EE genotype, children with the G allele had a significantly reduced risk of lifetime wheezing with low-ozone exposure [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.69]. The risk was not reduced in children living in high-ozone communities (aOR=0.98, 95% CI 0.57-1.67). This difference in genotypic effects between low- and high-pollution environments was statistically significant. The reduction of the protective effect from the G allele with higher air pollution was most marked in the GSTP1-105 Ile/Val or Val/Val and GSTM1 null groups.", "The FcepsilonRIbeta E237G allele may have a protective role in wheezing illness among Taiwanese schoolchildren, depending on airway oxidative stress levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y-L", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gilliland", "ForeName": "F D", "Initials": "FD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J-Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y-C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Y L", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "8906443", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MS4A2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, IgE"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, IgE"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Sounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schools"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18269668", "10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02916.x", "CEA2916"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
