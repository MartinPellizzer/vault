The ozone effects on pulmonary immune cells have been studied by various in vivo and in vitro systems. In this report, we characterized a model system of cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage (THP-1 cells) exposed to ozone in vitro by studying cell viability and cell surface marker expression. THP-1 cells exposed to ozone in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 ppm for 1 h were analyzed for cell viability and apoptosis (Annexin V/7-Amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) flow cytometric assay) either immediately after ozone exposure or at later time points. This analysis showed absence of apoptosis and a small decrease in cell viability (5-17%) in ozone-exposed THP-1 cells. Cell surface protein expression (CD14 and CD11b) did not change following ozone exposure, but the effect of lipopolysaccharride (LPS) on TNF-alpha production following ozone exposure changed compared to filtered air/LPS-exposed cells. These findings indicate that this in vitro ozone cell-exposure system may be used in studies where the effects of various agents (physiological and non-physiological) on phagocytic cells can be analyzed. This model system offers conditions where the experimental results are not due to cell death, but rather due to the effects of ozone and/or agents under investigation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Janic", "ForeName": "Branislava", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Umstead", "ForeName": "Todd M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phelps", "ForeName": "David S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Floros", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1R01 ES09882-01", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Immunol Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "1305440", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1759"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD11b Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "CD11b Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12505718", "10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00440-4", "S0022175902004404"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
