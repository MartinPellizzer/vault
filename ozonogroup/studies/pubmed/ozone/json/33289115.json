However, recent studies have shown that contaminated products may serve as vehicles for foodborne pathogens and harmful chemicals. Therefore, fresh vegetables must be decontaminated before consumption to ensure food safety.", "In this study, the combined decontamination treatment of lactic acid (2.5 mL\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> ) and ozone (9 mg\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> ) for 10 min showed better efficacy in the removal of contaminants from fresh vegetables as compared to individual treatments. The combined treatment resulted in a reduction of 1.5-3.5 log CFU of native mesophilic bacteria per gram and 1.6-2.9 log CFU of artificially inoculated Escherichia coli per gram from tomato, cucumber, carrot and lettuce. The combined treatment also removed spiked pesticides, which represent artificial chemical contamination (28-97% chlorpyrifos and 62-100% \u03bb-cyhalothrin residues), from fresh vegetables. No significant difference (P\u2009>\u20090.05) in various sensory attributes of vegetables was observed between untreated and treated (lactic acid and ozone) vegetables.", "The combination treatment provides a novel approach to target two groups of contaminants using a single procedure. The combination treatment can be used as an alternative to currently used decontamination techniques for the supply of safe vegetables to consumers. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fruit and Vegetable Technology, CSIR - Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Pounraj", "ForeName": "Saranya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fruit and Vegetable Technology, CSIR - Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Bhilwadikar", "ForeName": "Tanmayee", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Protectant and Infestation Control, CSIR - Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Manivannan", "ForeName": "Selladurai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0790-5841"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, CSIR - Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Rastogi", "ForeName": "Navin K", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0458-6294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fruit and Vegetable Technology, CSIR - Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, India."}], "LastName": "Negi", "ForeName": "Pradeep S", "Initials": "PS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "LSRB 305/FSH-ABB/2017", "Agency": "Defence Research and Development Organisation", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Rashmi HB and Negi PS, Health benefits of bioactive compounds from vegetables, in Plant Derived Bioactives: Production, Properties and Therapeutic Applications, ed. by Swamy MK.
