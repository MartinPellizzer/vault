Recognizing their equivalence to the corresponding [n]-formyl-[n]-cycloalkanes, we have conceived of a general synthetic strategy in which \"intramolecular cascade acetalizations\" constitute the pivotal step. As our first synthetic effort, we describe the synthesis of pentaoxa-[5]-peristylane 3b from the readily available Diels-Alder adduct 10 of 5,5-dimethoxy-tetrachlorocyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride. The norbornyl framework of 10 serves as the rigid structural matrix to build the stereochemical features and latent aldehyde functionalities as in 9 through a series of functional group adjustments. Ozonation of 9 furnished 3b in a one-step transformation in which five tetrahydrofuran rings were generated. While 3b exhibited C(5v) symmetry in solution, its symmetry in the solid state was observed to be C(s) by X-ray crystallography. In the solid state, 3b is endowed with a multicolumnar architecture, whose distinctive features include C-H...O interactions involving the less acidic cyclopentane hydrogens. Indeed, all the 10 CH moieties and 5 oxygen atoms (through both the lone pairs) of 3b (C(10)H(10)O(5)) are involved in short C-H...O contacts (strong and soft) and its crystal structure indicates marked proclivity toward maximal hydrogen bonding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore-560 012, India. gm@orgchem.iisc.ernet.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehta", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vidya", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11597208", "10.1021/jo010222v", "jo010222v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
