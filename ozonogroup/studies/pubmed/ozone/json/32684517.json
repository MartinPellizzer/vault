Among them, contaminants can be transformed by humus-reducing bacteria based on humus. In this study, O<sub>3</sub>- assisted UV-Fenton method was applied as pretreatment. Biological activated carbon (BAC) technology in which humus-reducing bacteria were the dominant bacteria, enhanced by electron donor and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, was used to dispose of RO concentrate (ROC). The results showed that water treatment process combining oxidation with biological filtration had a positive effect on the removal of stubborn contaminants in ROC. The system was strengthened by adding electron donor and Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was up to 80.1%. However, when the removal efficiency of UV<sub>254</sub> absorbing pollutants reached optimal value (87.3%), that means only Fe<sup>3+</sup> was added."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
