Current ozone medical preparation in dermatology mainly classified as ozone hydrotherapy, ozonated oil externally used and ozone autohemotherapy (OAHT). Admittedly, ozone is widely used in various fields against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, viruses, and fungi. More recently, great progress has been obtained in wound healing which is a multiphase process that consists of three overlapping but distinct stages: inflammation, tissue proliferation and remodeling. While the exact mechanisms of ozone-therapy still remain unclear. Therefore, more evidence is required before ozone can be presented as a promising method for the management and prevention of various skin diseases. In this review, we review the application status of ozone in dermatology and summarize possible mechanisms of ozone-therapy on skin diseases, aims to shed a light on providing a series of theoretical basis for its applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
