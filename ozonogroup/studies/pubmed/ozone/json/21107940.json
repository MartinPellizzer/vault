Targeted application of ozone (8 ml; 38 \u03b3/ml) and 50 mg ciprofloxacin close to the abnormal areas was also performed. Short and long term efficacy (1 week, 3 months, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months) was prospectively evaluated. VAS score <5 and ODI <40% were considered as a positive outcome.The treatment significantly reduced VAS score in all three groups of patients starting from the first week and throughout the entire follow-up period (P < 0.001). Disability Index (ODI) too showed encouraging results (P < 0.001) that was particularly evident at 3 months and maintained up to long-term follow-up intervals.Epiduroscopy by mechanical adhesiolysis and administration on targeted areas of ciprofloxacin and ozone seems to be, in this prospective study, an effective technique to provide a sensible and persisting pain relief and act of improving ODI in chronic low back pain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pain Management Center, Concordia Hospital for Special Surgery, Via Citt\u00e0 della Pieve N.19, 00191, Rome, Italy. attilio.didonato@fastwebnet.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donato", "ForeName": "A Di", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fontana", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beltrutti", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Acta Neurochir Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "100962752", "ISSNLinking": "0065-1419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5E8K9I0O4U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ciprofloxacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Endoscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Epidural Space"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21107940", "10.1007/978-3-211-99370-5_11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
