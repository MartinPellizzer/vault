The study aims to estimate the effect of ambient air pollution on pediatric asthma LOS in the Bronx, NY.", "A total of 1,920 children admitted to the hospital in Bronx, NY due to asthma during 2017-2019 period were included in the study. Demographic and clinical parameters were obtained from medical records. Daily ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) measurements were obtained from local air quality networks. Poisson regression adjusting for gender, age, weight status, respiratory infections including influenza, and ambient temperature was applied to determine whether there was an association of air pollution with length of hospital stay.", "The mean LOS varied by age, sex, weight status, influenza vaccination status, respiratory viral panel (RVP) results, asthma controller use, and asthma classification. After controlling for these factors in Poisson regression, the mean LOS increased up to 10.62% (95%CI: 0.78-21.41; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.03) for an increase of 10\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on admission day, and 3.90% (95%CI = 0.06-7.88; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.05) for an increase of 10\u2009ppbv of O<sub>3</sub> concentration during the previous day.", "Ambient particulate and ozone pollution is associated with lengthier hospital stays for pediatric asthma, potentially indicating more severe asthma exacerbations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Hardell", "ForeName": "Jennifer", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Silver", "ForeName": "Ellen J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental, Occupational and Geospatial Health Sciences, School of Public Health, City University of NY, New York City, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Kavouras", "ForeName": "Ilias", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kravis Children's Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Diana S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Gross", "ForeName": "Elissa", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Length of Stay"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Influenza, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37310769", "10.1080/02770903.2023.2225607"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
