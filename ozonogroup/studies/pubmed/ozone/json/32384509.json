However, there is no unified standard protocol for Chinese herbal bath. Many factors affect the curative effect of Chinese herbal bath, such as water temperature, bath concentration, and soaking time. Most studies involving Chinese herbal bath has described the bath generally, and few studies have investigated the factors that might contribute to the efficacy of Chinese herbal bath. Here we describe a protocol to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various bathwater temperatures and herbal concentrations on psoriasis vulgaris, and their effect on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 23 (IL-23), and interleukin 17 (IL-17). These data could be useful for optimizing Chinese herbal bath treatments.", "In this randomized controlled trial, we planned to recruit 288 hospitalized atients with psoriasis vulgaris aged 18 to 65 years. All participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the observation group, the control group, or the basic treatment group. The observation group will be divided into 6 sub-groups according to water temperatures and bath concentrations, designated as observation groups 1 to 6. Thirty-six participants will be assigned to each group. The basic treatment group will be given co-qingdai capsule, po 2\u200ag tid; compound glycyrrhizin tablet, po 75\u200amg tid; AA Skincare jojoba Oil, us.ext qd. The observation group will be given a Chinese herbal bath at the same time as the basic treatment. The control group will be given ozone hydrotherapy at the same time as the basic treatment. The entire treatment course will last for 2 weeks. The following parameters will be compared in each group, before and 2 weeks after treatment: the psoriasis area and severity index score (PASI), pruritus score, clinical efficacy, and dermatology life quality index score (DLQI); serum levels of serum VEGF, TNF-\u03b1, IL-23, and IL-17; and confocal laser scanning microscope images.", "This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of various Chinese herbal bath conditions (water temperatures and herbal concentrations) on the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, which will provide an important reference for the operation of Chinese herbal bath.", "ChiCTR1900027468."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wenxia", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Qianying", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Clinical Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yuesi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Yinkang Psoriasis Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, PR China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Yinkang Psoriasis Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, PR China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jianhua", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Shengzhen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jiahao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Mingling", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial Protocol", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Medicine (Baltimore)", "NlmUniqueID": "2985248R", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7974"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R1R8QUL21Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Qingdai compound"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Menter A, Gottlieb A, Feldman SR, et al.
