It was demonstrated that most of the reactant molecules are in direct (productive) contact with gaseous ozone, thus the technique produces snow with organic molecules largely ejected to the surface of snow grains. The kinetic data were used to evaluate the snow specific surface area (\u223c70 cm(2) g(-1)). This number is a measure of the availability of the molecules on the surface for chemical reaction with gaseous species. The experimental results were consistent with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type reaction mechanism. DPE represents environmentally relevant compounds such as alkenes which can react with atmospheric ozone, and are relatively abundant in natural snow. For typical atmospheric ozone concentrations in polar areas (20 ppbv), we estimated that half-life of DPE on the surface of snow grains is \u223c5 days at submonolayer coverages and -15 \u00b0C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kamenice 3, 62500 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ray", "ForeName": "Debajyoti", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurkov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Romana", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hovorkov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Ivana", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kl\u00e1n", "ForeName": "Petr", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Styrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BX0L5B6LLL", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenylethylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Snow"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Styrenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22070465", "10.1021/es202922k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
