The samples were allowed to diffuse into the culture medium for two hours, later the S. mutans were streaked on to the blood agar medium and the E. faecalis were streaked on to the Muller Hilton agar medium and incubated for 48 hours at 370C the zone of inhibition was measured after 48 hours.", "There was no growth of microorganisms seen with ozonated water. Chlorhexidine showed large zone of inhibition compared to the other groups.
