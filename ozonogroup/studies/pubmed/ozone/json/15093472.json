The plants were fumigated in natural climatic conditions using an open-air exposure system during two growing seasons. Control plants were grown under ambient air, and the elevated-ozone exposures were 1.6x the ambient in 1994 and 1.7x the ambient in 1995. The differences in ozone sensitivity among clones were large. Ozone tolerance was related to thicker leaves and higher stomatal density as compared to sensitive clones. Ultrastructural ozone-induced symptoms were found in chloroplasts of sensitive clones. Increased number of visibly injured leaves on fumigated plants was correlated with reduced leaf formation, foliage area, shoot dry wt and number of stomata, and increased yellowing of leaves. The results suggest that a considerable proportion of birch trees, showing high sensitivity to ozone, are at risk if ambient ozone exposures increase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, 70211, Kuopio, Finland.
