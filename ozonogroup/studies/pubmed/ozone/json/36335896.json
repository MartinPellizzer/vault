Existing O<sub>3</sub> datasets with coarse spatiotemporal resolution and limited coverage, and the uncertainties of O<sub>3</sub> influential factors seriously restrain related epidemiology and air pollution studies. To tackle above issues, we proposed a novel scheme to estimate daily O<sub>3</sub> concentrations on a fine grid scale (1\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km) from 2018 to 2020 across China based on machine learning methods using hourly observed ground-level pollutant concentrations data, meteorological data, satellite data, and auxiliary data including digital elevation model (DEM), land use data (LUD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population (POP), and nighttime light images (NTL), and to identify the difference of influential factors of O<sub>3</sub> on diverse urbanization and topography conditions. Some findings were achieved. The correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) between O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and surface net solar radiation (SNSR), boundary layer height (BLH), 2\u00a0m temperature (T2M), 10\u00a0m v-component (MVW), and NDVI were 0.80, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, and 0.20, respectively. The random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest validation R<sup>2</sup> (0.86) and lowest validation RMSE (13.74\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) in estimating O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, followed by support vector machine (SVM) (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.75, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a018.39\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), backpropagation neural network (BP) (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.74, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a019.26\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), and multiple linear regression (MLR) (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.52, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a025.99\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). Our China High-Resolution O<sub>3</sub> Dataset (CHROD) exhibited an acceptable accuracy at different spatial-temporal scales. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations showed decreasing trend and represented obviously spatiotemporal heterogeneity across China from 2018 to 2020. Overall, O<sub>3</sub> was mainly affected by human activities in higher urbanization regions, while O<sub>3</sub> was mainly controlled by meteorological factors, vegetation coverage, and elevation in lower urbanization regions. The scheme of this study is useful and valuable in understanding the mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> formation and improving the quality of the O<sub>3</sub> dataset."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
