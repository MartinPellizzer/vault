The spatial distribution characteristics of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere were obtained, and the chemical reactivity of the main components was studied. The results showed that the VOCs with carbon atoms greater than 5 (VOC<sub>C>5</sub>) were mainly toluene propylbenzene and n-octane, and the spatial distribution was significant; the average <i>\u03c1</i>(TVOC<sub>C>5</sub>) in the port area, downtown area, and industrial area were 80.5, 115.3, and 118.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Combined with road traffic impact and industrial production emissions, the maximum <i>\u03c1</i>(TVOC<sub>C>5</sub>) on the main roads in Rizhao City appeared near the Yingbin Road; the concentration value was 164.37 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>; the <i>\u03c1</i>(BTEX) in adhesive processing, painting, and glass factories reached 432.34, 1010.84, and 1989.85 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The chemical reactivity analysis of the main components of VOC<sub>C>5</sub> showed that BTEX and n-octane were the important active components of ozone formation in Rizhao City."]}, "AuthorList":
