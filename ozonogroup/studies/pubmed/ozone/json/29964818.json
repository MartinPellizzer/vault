The composition, chemical reactivity, and concentration level and its variation characteristics of VOCs were studied, and the health risk of aromatic compounds was assessed. Results showed that the mean mass concentrations of total VOCs (TVOCs) were (108.57\u00b152.43) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and (132.61\u00b149.31) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> for the urban and roadside atmospheric environments, respectively. The highest mass concentrations were observed for alkanes, followed by aromatics, alkenes, and alkynes. Aromatics and alkenes contributed more to ozone formation potential (OFP) of the urban and roadside atmospheric environments, and <i>m/p</i>-xylene, toluene, ethene, <i>o</i>-xylene, and propene were the key reactive species. The values of hazard quotient and hazard index were less than 1 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and <i>o</i>-xylene (BTEX), showing that they had no appreciable risk of non-cancer health effects on the exposed population. However, the value of cancer risk was above the safety threshold for benzene, showing that it was a potential cancer risk to the exposed population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, China West Normal University, Nanchong 637009, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "You-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, China West Normal University, Nanchong 637009, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, China West Normal University, Nanchong 637009, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Zhong-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, China West Normal University, Nanchong 637009, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, China West Normal University, Nanchong 637009, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-Lian", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, China West Normal University, Nanchong 637009, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zheng-Zheng", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Economics and Policy Research, Guangdong Academy of Social Science, Guangzhou 510610, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Da-Lei", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964818", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201701057"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
