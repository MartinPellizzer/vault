An anion-exchange column was used with 2.7 mM carbonate-0.3 mM hydrogencarbonate eluent. The eluent from the column was then allowed to react with a SO2-reduced fuchsin solution and then with a diluted HCl solution at 65 degrees C. The developed colour of the final product was measured spectrophotometrically at 530 nm. Linearity was checked up to 50 micrograms/l with a 200-microliter injection loop (r2 = 0.9997) and up to 100 micrograms/l of bromate with 100 microliters loop (r2 = 0.9939). Nitrate, sulfate, bromide, phosphate, fluoride did not interfere at 100 mg/l concentration level; only nitrite at concentration levels greater than 3 mg/l caused partial overlapping with bromate peak, but this value is not likely to occur in common drinking water. The detection limit (3 sigma) is 0.1 microgram/l (1 microgram/l propagation error approach)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ENEL SRI, Polo Ambiente, Segrate, MI, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Achilli", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romele", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Rosaniline Dyes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosaniline Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10431364", "10.1016/s0021-9673(99)00190-9", "S0021-9673(99)00190-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
