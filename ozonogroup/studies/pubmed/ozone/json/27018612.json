We exploited the ability of the sCI to oxidize SO2 to H2SO4, which we measured with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer. We produced the Criegee intermediates (CI) in a high-pressure flow reactor via ozonolysis of 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene (tetramethyl ethylene, TME) and measured the relative H2SO4 concentrations with and without an added OH scavenger. Because the TME reaction with ozone forms acetone oxide (a syn-CI) with unit efficiency, we directly calculated the sCI yields at different pressures from the precisely measured ratio of the uncalibrated H2SO4 signal with and without the scavenger. We observed a linear pressure dependence between 50 and 900 Torr with a minimum stabilization of 12.7 \u00b1 0.6% at 50 Torr and a maximum stabilization of 42 \u00b1 2% at 900 Torr. A linear fit to the measured data points shows a zero-pressure intercept of 15 \u00b1 2%, constraining the fraction of CI formed below the barrier for acetone oxide isomerization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, Carnegie Mellon University , 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Department of Physics, University of Helsinki , Gustaf H\u00e4llstr\u00f6minkatu 2 A, 00560 Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "Hakala", "ForeName": "Jani P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies, Carnegie Mellon University , 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, United States."}], "LastName": "Donahue", "ForeName": "Neil M", "Initials": "NM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27018612", "10.1021/acs.jpca.6b01538"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
