This study aims to understand the causes of O<sub>3</sub> pollution during the event using an emission-based model (i.e., the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model) and an observation-based model (OBM). The OBM was used to investigate O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity to its precursors during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution, concluding that O<sub>3</sub> formation was limited by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on August 19, but was co-limited by VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx) on other polluted days. Aromatics and alkenes were the two main VOC groups contributing to the O<sub>3</sub> formation, with trans-2-butene and m/p-xylene as the key species among the VOCs measured at the Nanjing urban site. The source apportionment results estimated using the source-oriented CMAQ model suggest that the transportation and industry sources dominated the non-background O<sub>3</sub> production in Nanjing, which were responsible for 52% and 24.7%, respectively. The O<sub>3</sub> concentration attributed to NOx (~70%) was significantly higher than that attributed to VOCs (approximately 30%). The process analysis revealed that vertical mixing increased the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the early morning, and photochemical reactions promoted O<sub>3</sub> formation and accumulation during the daytime within the planetary boundary layer. At night, outflow from horizontal transport and nocturnal chemistry jointly resulted the O<sub>3</sub> depletion. The contributions of inter-city transport during the O<sub>3</sub> pollution period in Nanjing were also estimated. The predicted O<sub>3</sub> concentration was largely recorded from long-distance regions, reaching 46%, followed by local sources (38%) and surrounding cities (16%). The results indicate that both NOx and VOCs contributed significantly to O<sub>3</sub> pollution during this event, and the emissions controls of NOx and the key VOC species of aromatics and alkenes from a cooperative regional perspective should be considered to mitigate O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
