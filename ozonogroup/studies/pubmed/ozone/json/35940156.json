The importance of the quantity of OM is known, because of this, total organic carbon (TOC) is generally used to determine the required ozone dose for any water sample. Still, the effect of OM type on MP ozonation is not well understood. In this study, effluents from five wastewater treatment plants were collected and the organic matter in these effluents was fractionated using membranes (F1-4) and resin (HI, HOA, HON and HOB). Fractions were diluted to the same TOC concentration, spiked with MPs and ozonated at three ozone doses. Our results show that all five effluents had comparable OM compositions and similar MP removal, confirming the suitability of OM quantity (TOC) to compare the ozone requirements for wastewater effluents. From the 19 analysed MPs, three groups were identified that showed similar removal behaviour. The strongest differences between the groups were observed around MP ozone reactivities of 10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. This indicates the presence of three OM groups in the samples that interfere with the removal of different MPs. MP removal in the resin fraction HON were higher for MPs with high and medium ozone reactivity, indicating a low interference of OM in this fraction with MP ozonation. OM in the resin fractions HOA and HI showed higher interference with MP ozonation. Therefore, removing the HOA and HI fractions prior to ozonation would result in a lower required ozone dose and a more efficient removal of the MPs. MP removal correlated with the OM characteristics A300, SR and fluorescence component comp 2. These characteristics can be used as inline tools to predict the required ozone dose in water treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
