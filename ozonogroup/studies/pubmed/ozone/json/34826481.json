The development of strategies to control O<sub>3</sub> precursor emissions, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>), depends to a large extent on the source region of the O<sub>3</sub> pollution. In this study, by combining the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem), the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA), and the Flexible Particle model (FLEXPART), more effective strategies of controlling O<sub>3</sub> precursor emissions were identified under two typical types of O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes: local formation (LF)-dominant (8-12 September 2019) and regional transport (RT)-dominant (23-27 October 2017) episodes, distinguished by the WRF-FLEXPART model. During the LF-dominant episode, the EKMA revealed that the O<sub>3</sub> formation in Dongguan was in a transitional regime, and the abatement of solvent use-VOCs emissions in the key area of Dongguan was more effective in reducing O<sub>3</sub> levels, with an emission reduction benefit 1.7 times that of total VOCs emission sources throughout Dongguan. With respect to the RT-dominant episode, the reduction in VOCs emissions in the local region did not effectively curb O<sub>3</sub> pollution, although the photochemical regime of the O<sub>3</sub> formation in Dongguan was VOCs-limited. A 50% reduction in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in the upwind regions (parts of Guangzhou and Huizhou) effectively decreased the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Dongguan by 17%. The results of this study emphasize the importance of the source region of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the implementation of effective O<sub>3</sub> control strategies and provide valuable insights for region-specific precursor emission policy formulation, not only in Dongguan, but also in other regions facing severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
