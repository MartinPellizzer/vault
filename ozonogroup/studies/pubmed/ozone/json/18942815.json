The heterogeneous reactions of ozone with hydrocarbons covalently linked to oxide surfaces serve as models for studying heterogeneous oxidation of biogenic terpenes adsorbed to mineral aerosol surfaces commonly found in the troposphere. Vibrational SFG is also used to track the C=C double bond oxidation reactions initiated by ozone in real time and to characterize the surface-bound product species. Combined with contact angle measurements carried out before and after ozonolysis, the kinetic and spectroscopic studies presented here suggest reaction pathways involving vibrationally hot Criegee intermediates that compete with pathways that involve thermalized surface species. Kinetic measurements suggest that the rate limiting step in the heterogeneous C=C double bond oxidation reactions is likely to be the formation of the primary ozonide. From the determination of the reactive uptake coefficients, we find that ozone molecules undergo between 100 and 10000 unsuccessful collisions with C=C double bonds before the reaction occurs. The magnitude of the reactive uptake coefficients for the cyclic and linear olefins studied here does not follow the corresponding gas-phase reactivities but rather correlates with the accessibility of the C=C double bonds at the surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stokes", "ForeName": "Grace Y", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buchbinder", "ForeName": "Avram M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gibbs-Davis", "ForeName": "Julianne M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scheidt", "ForeName": "Karl A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Geiger", "ForeName": "Franz M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18942815", "10.1021/jp803277s"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
