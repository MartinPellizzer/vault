Lakes are hotspots for N<sub>2</sub>O release due to the imbalance between N<sub>2</sub>O sources and sinks. N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacteria are the only biological means to mitigate N<sub>2</sub>O emission, yet their roles in lakes are not well studied. This study investigated the potential for N<sub>2</sub>O reduction, keystones of typical and atypical N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacterial communities, and their correlations with environmental factors in the sediments of Lake Taihu through microcosm experiments, high-throughput sequencing of the nosZ gene, and statistical modeling. The results showed that potential N<sub>2</sub>O reduction rates in sediments ranged from 13.71 to 76.95\u202f\u03bcg N<sub>2</sub>O g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, with lower rates in December compared to March and July. Correlation analysis indicated that the nosZ II/nosZ I ratio and the trophic lake index (TLI) were the primary factors influencing N<sub>2</sub>O reduction rates and N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacterial community structures. The genera Pseudogulbenkiania and Ardenticatena were identified as the most abundant typical and atypical N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacteria, respectively, and were also recognized as the keystone taxa. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) results revealed the nosZ II was more abundant than nosZ I in the sediments. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) further demonstrated that atypical N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacteria had significant positive effects on N<sub>2</sub>O reduction process in the sediments (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Overall, this study highlights the crucial ecological roles of atypical N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacteria in the sediments of the eutrophic lake of Taihu, underscoring their potential to mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
