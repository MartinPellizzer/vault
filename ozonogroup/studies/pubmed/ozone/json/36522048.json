In this study, three typical synoptic circulations types (CTs) that influenced more than 80% of O<sub>3</sub> polluted days in Fuzhou during 2014-2019 were identified using a subjective approach. The characteristics of meteorological conditions linked to photochemical formation and transport of O<sub>3</sub> under the three CTs were summarized. Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions was applied to simulate O<sub>3</sub> episodes and to quantify O<sub>3</sub> sources from different regions in Fuzhou. When Fuzhou was located to the west of a high-pressure system (classified as \"East-ridge\"), more warm southwesterly currents flowed to Fuzhou, and the effects of cross-regional transport from Guangdong province and high local production promoted the occurrence of O<sub>3</sub> episodes. Under a uniform pressure field with a low-pressure system occurring to the east of Fuzhou (defined as \"East-low\"), stagnant weather conditions caused the strongest local production of O<sub>3</sub> in the atmospheric boundary layer. Controlled by high-pressure systems over the mainland (categorized as \"Inland-high\"), northerly airflows enhanced the contribution of cross-regional transport to O<sub>3</sub> in Fuzhou. The abnormal increases of the \"East-ridge\" and \"Inland-high\" were closely related to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Fuzhou in April and May 2018, resulting in the annual maximum number of O<sub>3</sub> polluted days during recent years. Furthermore, the rising number of autumn O<sub>3</sub> episodes in 2017-2019 was mainly related to the \"Inland-high\", indicating the aggravation of cross-regional transport and highlighting the necessity of enhanced regional collaboration and efforts in combating O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
