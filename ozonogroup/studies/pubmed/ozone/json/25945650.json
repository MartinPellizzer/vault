Our calculated yield of 42 \u00b1 6% for the stabilized CH2OO agrees well, within experimental error, with available (indirect) experimental results. Inclusion of angular momentum in the master equation is found to play an essential role in bringing the theoretical results into agreement with the experiment. Additionally, yields of HO and HO2 radical products are predicted to be 13 \u00b1 6% and 17 \u00b1 6%, respectively. In the kinetic simulation, the HO radical product is produced mostly from the stepwise decomposition mechanism of primary ozonide rather than from dissociation of hot CH2OO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, Mail Stop A5300, Austin, Texas 78712-0165, United States."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Thanh Lam", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, Mail Stop A5300, Austin, Texas 78712-0165, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyunwoo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, Mail Stop A5300, Austin, Texas 78712-0165, United States."}], "LastName": "Matthews", "ForeName": "Devin A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "McCarthy", "ForeName": "Michael C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin, Mail Stop A5300, Austin, Texas 78712-0165, United States."}], "LastName": "Stanton", "ForeName": "John F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25945650", "10.1021/acs.jpca.5b02088"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
