A midline laparotomy was performed and a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in the SG and OG was occluded with a 0/0 catgut suture, but in the CG, the incision was closed without any intervention. Tissue oxygenation was monitored with a tissue oxygenation monitor to achieve the same grade during intestinal ischemia. The incision was closed and, in the OG, ozone/oxygen mixture (0.7 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally, 20 minutes before reperfusion. Surgical incision was reopened and reperfusion was achieved after 60 minutes of ischemia in the SG and OG. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, 2 cm small intestine segment was sampled for histopathological assessment of the intestinal mucosal damage (Chiu score) and biochemical assessment of oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide: NO, malondialdehyde: MDA, superoxide dismutase: SOD) in all groups.", "The Chiu scores of the SG and OG were statistically increased than that of the CG (p=0.002; and p=0.002, respectively). Chiu score in the OG was higher compared to that in the SG, but not statistically significant (p=0.175). MDA levels were statistically higher in the SG and OG than that of the CG (p=0.004; and p=0.010, respectively). However, the difference between the SG and OG was not statistically significant (p=0.522). SOD and NO levels were not significantly different between groups (p=0.451 and p=0.056, respectively).", "Contrary to the literature, single-dose ozone therapy did not reduce the oxidative stress or improve the ischemic damage in intestinal I/R injury in rats. Further evaluation with different doses in different time periods is needed for potential clinical use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, K\u0131r\u0131kkale University Faculty of Medicine, K\u0131r\u0131kkale-Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dere G\u00fcnal", "ForeName": "Yasemin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara-Turkey."}], "LastName": "Boybeyi T\u00fcrer", "ForeName": "\u00d6zlem", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, K\u0131r\u0131kkale University Faculty of Medicine, K\u0131r\u0131kkale-Turkey."}], "LastName": "Atasoy", "ForeName": "P\u0131nar", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, K\u0131r\u0131kkale University Faculty of Medicine, K\u0131r\u0131kkale-Turkey."}], "LastName": "K\u0131sa", "ForeName": "\u00dc\u00e7ler", "Initials": "\u00dc"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, K\u0131r\u0131kkale University Faculty of Medicine, K\u0131r\u0131kkale-Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aslan", "ForeName": "Mustafa Kemal", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "S\u0131\u00e7anlarda ozonun ba\u011f\u0131rsak iskemi-reperf\u00fczyon hasar\u0131n\u0131n akut evresi \u00fczerine etkisi."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg", "NlmUniqueID": "101274231", "ISSNLinking": "1306-696X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32946094", "10.14744/tjtes.2020.48672"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
