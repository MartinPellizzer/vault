The development of novel and effective techniques for microbial decontamination is therefore vital to the food industry. Water presents a unique advantage for large-scale applications, which can be functionalized to inactivate microbial growth, ensuring the safety and quality of meat and seafood products. By taking into account the increased popularity of functionalized water utilization through electrolysis, ozonation and cold plasma technology, relevant literature regarding their applications in meat and seafood safety and quality are reviewed. In addition, the principles of generating functionalized water are presented, and the safety issues associated with their uses are also discussed.Functionalization of water is a promising approach for the microbiological safety and quality of meat and seafood products and possesses synergistic effects when combined with other decontamination approaches. However, functionalized water is often misused since the active antimicrobial component is applied at a much higher concentration, despite the availability of applicable regulations. Functionalized water also shows reduced antimicrobial efficiency and may produce disinfection by-products (DBPs) in the presence of organic matter, especially at a higher concentration of active microbial component. Utilization should be encouraged within regulated guidelines, especially as hurdle technology, while plasma functionalized water which emerges with great potentials should be exploited for future applications. It is hoped that this review should encourage the industry to adopt the functionalized water as an effective alternative technique for the food industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510641, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, & Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Esua", "ForeName": "Okon Johnson", "Initials": "OJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510641, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, & Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Jun-Hu", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510641, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, & Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Refrigeration and Computerized Food Technology (FRCFT), Agriculture and Food Science Centre, University College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Da-Wen", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food-Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foodborne Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seafood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32216453", "10.1080/10408398.2020.1735297"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
