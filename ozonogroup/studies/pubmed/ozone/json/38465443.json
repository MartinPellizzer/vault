First, the median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) and, if data were available, the median effective concentration, teratogenic index and minimum growth inhibitory concentration were determined for each drug substance without ozonation. Then, the active substance amounts of three selected nominal concentrations (LC<sub>50</sub>/2, LC<sub>50</sub>, and LC<sub>50</sub>\u00d72) of each test substance before ozonation were measured by HPLC analysis and the toxicity of these substances was evaluated after 2, 3, 4, and 5\u2009h of ozonation. In addition, degradation products that may occur during ozonation were evaluated by LC-MS analysis. The 96-h LC<sub>50</sub>s of Dolphin-diflunisal, Dichloron-diclofenac sodium, and Apranax-naproxen drug-active substance pairs were determined to be 22.3 and 11.1, 25.7 and 18.7, and 47.8\u2009mg active substance/L and 45.3\u2009mg/L, respectively. According to the FETAX test results, the Dolphin-diflunisal drug-active ingredient pair did not cause growth retardation in exposed embryos. Dichloron-diclofenac sodium and Apranax-naproxen drug-active ingredient pairs were both teratogenic and growth inhibitory. In the second stage of the study, in which the effectiveness of ozonation in eliminating the toxic effects of drugs is evaluated, it is seen that ozonation is partially successful in eliminating the toxic effects of Dolphin-diflunisal and Dichloron-diclofenac sodium pairs, but insufficient for eliminating the effects of the Apranax-naproxen pair."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Faculty of Education, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Emre", "ForeName": "Fatma Bilge", "Initials": "FB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Science, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Turhan", "ForeName": "Duygu \u00d6zhan", "Initials": "D\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7770-0660"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Science, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcng\u00f6rd\u00fc", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38465443", "10.1080/01480545.2024.2324325"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
