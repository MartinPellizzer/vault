In our hospital, patients with Gustilo type IIIB open fractures are treated with definitive internal fixation of the fracture followed by staged flap coverage (\"fix followed by flap\" protocol) when the \"fix and flap\" approach was not feasible due to the patient's condition or difficulty in coordinating surgery schedules. The \"fix followed by flap\" protocol provides benefits in terms of flexibility in adjusting the surgical timetable, simplifying the planning of flap coverage following fracture fixation, and minimizing individual surgical invasion.", "We reviewed 10 cases of severe open fractures treated with the \"fix followed by flap\" protocol and evaluated their outcomes. All surgical procedures, including wound debridement, fracture fixation, and flap coverage, were performed by orthoplastic surgeons specializing in both fracture surgery and microsurgery including soft tissue reconstruction.", "All free flaps survived, and no partial necrosis was observed. None of the patients developed postoperative deep infection up to the last follow-up. Fracture union was achieved in all patients with or without autologous bone grafts. The median time for union was 9.4 months (range, 4-12 months).", "This study presents favorable outcomes of treatment for Gustilo type IIIB open fractures with fracture fixation followed by staged flap coverage (\"fix followed by flap\" protocol). Despite a delay in flap coverage, the consistency of treatment provided by orthoplastic surgeons may have contributed to the favorable outcomes in this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
