Despite the addition of advanced treatment units in PCWW treatment plants to meet discharge standards, the mechanisms of molecular-level sights into DOM reactivity of the upgraded full-scale processes including multiple biological treatments and advanced treatment remain unclear. Herein, we employ water quality indexes, spectra, molecular weight (MW) distribution, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to systematically characterize DOM in a typical PCWW treatment plant including influent, micro-oxygen hydrolysis acidification (MOHA), anaerobic/oxic (AO), and micro-flocculation sand filtration-catalytic ozonation (MFSF-CO). Influent DOM is dominated by tryptophan-like and soluble microbial products with MW fractions \u3008 1 kDa and \u3009 100 kDa, and CHO with lignin and aliphatic/protein structures. MOHA effectively degrades macromolecular CHO (10.86 %) and CHON (5.24 %) compounds via deamination and nitrogen reduction, while AO removes CHOS compounds with MW < 10 kDa by desulfurization, revealing distinct DOM conversion mechanisms. MFSF-CO transforms unsaturated components to less aromatic and more saturated DOM through oxygen addition reactions and shows high CHOS and CHONS reactivity via desulfurization and deamination reactions, respectively. Moreover, the correlation among multiple parameters suggests UV<sub>254</sub> combined with AI<sub>mod</sub> as a simple monitoring indicator of DOM to access the chemical composition. The study provides molecular-level insights into DOM for the contribution to the improvement and optimization of the upgraded processes in PCWW."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
