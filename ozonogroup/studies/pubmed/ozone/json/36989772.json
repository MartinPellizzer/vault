Dodecylamine was used in this study to create active sites on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for photo-ozone catalytic mineralization of dichloromethane (DCM). Amine-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-450 is a dodecylamine-modified sample with high density of Co<sup>3+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and hydroxyl due to its nanosheet structure and exposed (112) facets. The optimized surface significantly enhanced the cleavage of the C-Cl bond at low temperatures. Photocatalysis primarily participated in the oxidation of intermediates following DCM dichlorination and significantly improved CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity. The respective DCM removal rate and mineralization efficiency of Amine-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-450 with an O<sub>3</sub>/DCM molar ratio of 1.27 and one-sun irradiation were 14.9 and 15.0 times higher than the sum of those in the presence of light irradiation or O<sub>3</sub> alone. This finding indicated that a strong synergistic effect exists between O<sub>3</sub> and light."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
