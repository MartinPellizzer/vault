However, they have not been tried in antibiotics or other organic pollutants removal from water by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Here we synthesized Mn anchored zeolite molecular nest (Mn@ZN) for the catalytic ozonation of cephalexin (CLX), which is the widely used antibiotic and also a refractory pollutant in water. The ozonation catalyzed by Mn@ZN achieves 97% of CLX degradation in only 2\u00a0min and a reaction rate constant of 0.2454\u00a0L\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>, which is 79.2 times higher than that of the non-catalytic ozonation. Even after ten cycles, the 0.46Mn@ZN/O<sub>3</sub> still achieves a CLX degradation efficiency higher than 88% in 2\u00a0min, presenting an excellent stability. Mn ions stabilized by the molecular nests facilitate Lewis acid sites and oxygen vacancies, providing active sites for O<sub>3</sub> sorption and decomposition into \u00b7O<sup>2-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> through electrons transfer for the radical reaction with CLX. DFT calculation indicates that both the oxygen vacancy formation energy and the O<sub>3</sub> adsorption energy of Mn@ZN are reduced by the Mn species introduction. This study finds a fascinating catalyst of Mn@ZN for the catalytic ozonation of antibiotics, and also a smart design strategy for zeolite confined metals catalysts for water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
