It was found that the separation capability of the DAF system could be even more enhanced by ozone. Ozone was applied as a substitute for air in the DAF system, so that the system was named as the DOF (Dissolved Ozone Flotation) system. Ozone not only enhances coagulation as is well known, but also provides larger micro-bubble volume because the solubility of ozone in water is much higher than that of air. Ozone enhanced the separation rate of SS by 13.6%, and turbidity by 21% in the DOF system compared to the DAF system. T-P was also removed 7.7% more in the DOF system. 41.5% of color and 7.4% of COD(Cr) were enhanced in their removal rate. Coliform and heterotrophic bacteria were removed 54% and 57.3% more in the DOF system. Separation capability of the DOF system was greatly enhanced for most of the water quality parameters because ozone provides strong oxidation power with large volume of micro-bubbles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Ulsan, Korea. bhlee@mail.ulsan.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Byoung-Ho", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Won-Chul", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hye-Young", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeong-Hyeon", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alum Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "34S289N54E", "NameOfSubstance": "aluminum sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alum Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flocculation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18048988", "10.2166/wst.2007.771"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
