This solution was compared with the UASB reactor coupled with other consolidated technologies in rural areas of Brazil, such as trickling filters, polishing ponds and constructed wetlands. To this end, full-scale systems were designed based on experimental data obtained from pilot/demonstrative scale systems. The functional unit was 1 m<sup>3</sup> of water. System boundaries comprised input and output flows of material and energy resources for system construction and operation. The LCA was performed with the software SimaPro\u00ae, using the ReCiPe midpoint method. The results showed that the HRAPs scenario was the most environmentally friendly alternative in 4 out of 8 impact categories (i.e. Global warming, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, Terrestrial Ecotoxicity and Fossil resource scarcity). This was associated with the increase in biogas production by the co-digestion of microalgae and raw wastewater, leading to higher electricity and heat recovery. From an economic point of view, despite the HRAPs showed a higher capital cost, the operation and maintenance costs were completely offset by the revenue obtained from the electricity generated. Overall, the UASB reactor coupled with HRAPS showed to be a feasible nature-based solution to be used in small communities in Brazil, especially when microalgae biomass is valorised and used to increase biogas productivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
