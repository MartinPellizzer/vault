Results showed that estrogen disruption effects (EDEs) were particularly significant for the raw secondary effluent among the studied dioxin-like toxicity effect, androgenic/anti-androgenic response effect, EDEs, and genotoxicity effect. And E1, E2, and EE2 were the main endocrine disruption chemicals (EDCs) contributing to EDEs. Except coagulation sedimentation, all the other four ATPs were efficient in removing the steroid estrogens (i.e. E1, E2, and EE2), but were inefficient in the artificial EDC (i.e. DBP, OP and BPA) removal. In the ATPs treated samples, vitellogenin (VTG) in zebrafish were largely removed. However, they were still significant in comparison with the control, probably due to artificial EDCs. Therefore, finding ways to thoroughly remove EDEs and EDCs from the secondary effluent will be a new research direction in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
