While several studies have focused on the fate and toxicity of organic micropollutants in wastewater, the environmental impacts of life cycle assessment induced by these organic micropollutants in advanced wastewater treatment processes are still unknown. To address this need, an environmental evaluation of three representative advanced wastewater treatment processes (ozonation, granular activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis) involving PPCPs removal was conducted using life cycle assessment and USEtox model in this study. Although a large amount of PPCPs can be eliminated during conventional waste highest characterization factors for freshwater toxicity, while 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, sertraline, and 17\u03b2-estradiol had the highest human toxicity characterization factors. From the perspective of LCA, reverse osmosis appeared to have the greatest environmental burden due to the high energy and material consumption during the treatment process. After involving 126 PPCPs in life cycle inventory, the ecotoxicity impact results were increased significantly in three advanced wastewater treatment processes. The contribution of effluent was improved in toxicity impact category, accounting more than 25% for the three processes. The effluent (including PPCPs) as the key factor was next only to electricity and chemicals in eutrophication, ecotoxicity and human toxicity impacts category particularly. Therefore, PPCPs should not be ignored in life cycle assessment of advanced wastewater treatment processes, although they are not typically monitored in wastewater. These results are valuable for conducting a comprehensive environmental evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment processes considering micro-pollutants removal. The identified PPCPs with high freshwater and human toxicity can be considered as the priority control index of organic micropollutants for wastewater treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
