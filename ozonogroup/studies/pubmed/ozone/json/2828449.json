Extensive studies of the mechanisms of action of two of these chemicals, ozone and toluene diisocyanate, have been conducted during the past decade. The results of these studies suggest that acute airway inflammation plays an important role in the effect of inhaled chemicals but that the specific aspects of the inflammatory response that lead to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness are different for different stimuli and among different mammalian species. These observations suggest that in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness can arise via several different mechanisms and is thus not likely to reflect a single underlying defect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California 94110."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheppard", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17X7AFZ1GH", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene 2,4-Diisocyanate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Ventilation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene 2,4-Diisocyanate"}], "NumberOfReferences": "24"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2828449", "10.1016/0091-6749(88)90231-x", "0091-6749(88)90231-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
