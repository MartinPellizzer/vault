Based on the five-year data of ozone, VOCs, and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> from three typical stations in Shanghai, namely Dianshan Lake Station \uff08suburban area\uff09, Pudong Station \uff08urban area\uff09, and Xinlian Station \uff08industrial area\uff09 from 2016 to 2020, the nonlinear relationship between ozone and precursors \uff08VOCs and NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>\uff09 during the high-ozone season in the five years was quantitatively analyzed using an observation model. The results showed that the peak months of near-surface ozone in Shanghai were from April to September during 2016 to 2020, with the highest values appearing from June to August. The volume fraction of VOCs and NO<sub>2</sub> concentration had a strong indicative significance for the O<sub>3</sub> concentration at Pudong Station. The O<sub>3</sub> concentration at Dianshan Lake Station was mainly influenced by regional environment, meteorological factors, and cross-regional transmission. The ozone concentration at Xinlian Station was a combination of environmental background concentration and industrial area photochemical pollution. Pudong Station and Dianshan Lake Station were in the VOCs control zone. Xinlian Station was gradually closer to the NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> control zone from 2016 to 2019, transitioning to the VOCs control zone since 2020.
