Many environmental pollutants cause lung injury which is concentrated in specific regions of the lung, such as, in small airways and in the proximal portions of alveolar ducts. Morphometric techniques to obtain unbiased estimates of tissue changes occurring in these specific regions are reviewed and contrasted to well-established techniques for morphometric analysis of the distal alveolar regions of the lung. Specific applications of morphometric studies in different toxicologic problems are illustrated and include quantification of the changes in lung tissue and in lung cellular population pattern in response to exposure of small animals to hyperoxic atmospheres and to ozone. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is an example of a diffuse lesion throughout the distal portion of the acinus whereas ozone exposure is an example of an environmental pollutant causing a greater degree of lung injury in the proximal alveolar region and in the small airways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barry", "ForeName": "B E", "Initials": "BE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crapo", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914275", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8444"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Volume Measurements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staining and Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}], "NumberOfReferences": "86"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2578919", "10.3109/10408448509023763"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
