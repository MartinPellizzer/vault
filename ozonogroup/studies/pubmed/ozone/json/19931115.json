Among them, dispersed and dissolved oils in produced water need to be removed adequately in order to reuse or avoid surface sheen from coastal discharge. We have recently developed a new ozonation technique coupled with sand filtration to quickly remove oil from process water and prevent oil sheen. The technique incorporates rapid, successive cycles of compression and decompression during ozonation. Gas bubbles expanding from small to large sizes occur that provide ample reactive zones at the gas-liquid interface, resulting in heightened chemical conversions-notably the conversion of hydrophobic hydrocarbon molecules into hydrophilic ones. This study examined the removal of hydrocarbons and sheen according to treatment parameters and configurations, as assessed by changes in turbidity, COD, BOD, and sheen presence following treatment. When a synthetic produced water containing 120ppm of oil (about 100ppm of dispersed and 20ppm of soluble oil at a total COD of 320mgL(-1)) was subjected to 10 pressure cycles (reaching 1.0MPa; 20s each) of ozonation and sand filtration at 6cmmin(-1) and then repeated by 20 cycles of ozonation and sand filtration, it resulted in removal of oil to 20ppm as water-soluble organic acids, decrease of turbidity from 200 to 2NTU, and complete sequestration of surface sheen. The new technique offers a treatment alternative for produced water and likely other tailings waters, promoting safe discharge to the environment and beneficial uses of the water."], "CopyrightInformation": "2009 Elsevier Ltd.
