Recent studies have suggested an association between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality and morbidity. In this context, a close association between increased levels of air pollutants such as particulate matter \u22642.5 to 10 \u00b5M, ozone and nitrogen dioxide and SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admissions and mortality due to COVID 19 has been reported. Air pollutants can make individuals more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection by inducing the expression of proteins such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that are required for viral entry into the host cell, while causing impairment in the host defence system by damaging the epithelial barrier, muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting the antiviral response and causing immune dysregulation. The aim of this review is to report the epidemiological evidence on impact of air pollutants on COVID 19 in an up-to-date manner, as well as to provide insights on in vivo and in vitro mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.
