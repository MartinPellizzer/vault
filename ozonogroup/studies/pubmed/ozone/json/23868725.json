This paper deals with assessing the intraspecific variability of two wheat cultivars (PBW 343 and M 533) at different growth stages using open top chambers. Mean O3 concentrations were 50.2 and 53.2 ppb, and AOT40 values were 9 and 12.1 ppm h, respectively, in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010. Reproductive stage showed higher AOT40 values (6.9 and 9.2 ppm h) compared to vegetative (2.23 and 2.9 ppm h). Critical levels of a 3-month AOT 40 of 3 ppm h led to 6% yield reduction in two wheat cultivars for two consecutive years. Variations in photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance (gs), Fv/Fm ratio, photosynthetic pigments, primary and secondary metabolites, morphological parameters, and yield attributes were measured at vegetative and reproductive stages. Reductions in number of leaves, leaf area, total biomass, root/shoot ratio, RGR, photosynthetic pigments, protein content, and Fv/Fm ratio in PBW 343 were more than M 533 at reproductive stage. Photosynthetic rate did not vary between the cultivars, but gs was higher in PBW 343 compared to M 533 under ambient O3. Higher total phenolics and peroxidase activity were recorded in M 533 at reproductive stage conferring higher resistance at latter age. Results of O3 resistance showed that M 533 was sensitive compared to PBW 343 during vegetative stage but developed more resistance at reproductive stage. PBW 343 with larger leaf area and high gs is more sensitive than M 533 with smaller leaf area and low gs. The study suggests that the sensitivity varied with plant growth stage, and the plant showing higher sensitivity during vegetative period developed more resistance during reproductive period due to higher defense mechanism. Though the yield reductions were same in both cultivars under ambient O3, the mechanism of acquiring the resistance is different between the cultivars."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India."}], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Richa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Madhoolika", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2005 Oct;61(2):218-28", "ArticleIdList": ["16168745"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Biochem Anal. 1954;1:27-52", "ArticleIdList": ["13193524"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2005 Nov;138(1):153-60", "ArticleIdList": ["15922496"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1968 Apr;125(1):189-98", "ArticleIdList": ["5655425"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol Biochem. 2004 Jun;42(6):549-55", "ArticleIdList": ["15246069"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2008 Dec 15;407(1):679-91", "ArticleIdList": ["18962826"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2006 Aug;119(1-3):15-30", "ArticleIdList": ["16736274"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci (China). 2003 May;15(3):360-2", "ArticleIdList": ["12945536"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Monit Assess. 2009 Dec;159(1-4):125-41", "ArticleIdList": ["18998224"]}, {"Citation": "J Proteome Res. 2010 Sep 3;9(9):4565-84", "ArticleIdList": ["20701290"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Int. 2003 Jun;29(2-3):141-54", "ArticleIdList": ["12676202"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1987;47(2):95-113", "ArticleIdList": ["15092712"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2010 Dec;158(12):3539-45", "ArticleIdList": ["20855141"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2010 Sep;158(9):2970-6", "ArticleIdList": ["20598788"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Dec;88(4):1115-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16666430"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2005 Apr;134(3):385-95", "ArticleIdList": ["15620584"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23868725", "10.1007/s11356-013-1981-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
