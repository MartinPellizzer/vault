Hospital admissions for CP and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period 2009-2013. The relative risk of hospital admissions was estimated using a case-crossover approach, after controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For single-pollutant models (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased frequency of CP admissions was significantly associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels on warm days (>23\u00b0C), with an interquartile range rise correlated with a 15% (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a011-31%) elevation in number of CP admissions. In two-pollutant models, PM<sub>2.5</sub> remained significant after inclusion of each of the other four pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) on warm days. Generally, no marked associations were observed between PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels and risk of CP admissions on cool days in both single- and two-pollutant models. This study provides evidence that higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations enhance the risk of hospital admissions for CP on warm days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Chang-Gung , Memorial Hospital and Chang-Gung University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chih-Cheng", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , National Health Research Institute , Miaoli , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chest Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28956714", "10.1080/15287394.2017.1376407"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
