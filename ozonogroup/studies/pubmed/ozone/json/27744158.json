Huang (1840m above mean sea level). The average particle number concentration was 2.35\u00d710<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>, and the ultrafine particles (<0.1\u03bcm) represented 70.5% of the total particle number concentration. Excluding the accumulation mode particles, the average daytime particle number concentrations were prominently higher than those measured at nighttime, suggesting there was a diurnal pattern of changes between planetary boundary layer and free troposphere air. The aerosol spectra were classified into two categories: the first category (FCS) exhibited a clear diurnal cycle, with relatively higher number concentration (3.19\u00d710<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>), smaller sizes and air masses from the inland; the second category (SCS) presented less obvious diurnal cycle, with lower number concentration (1.88\u00d710<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>), larger sizes and air masses from coastal regions. Air mass sources, weather conditions, and new particle formation (NPF) events were responsible for the differences of these two particle spectra. Six NPF events were identified, which usually began at 10:00-11:00 LT, with the estimated formation rate J<sub>10</sub> in the range of 0.09-0.30cm<sup>-3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and the growth rate at 1.42-4.53nmh<sup>-1</sup>. Wind speed, sulfur dioxide and ozone concentrations were higher on NPF days than those on non-NPF days, whereas temperature, relative humidity, concentrations of nitrogen oxide and carbonic oxide were lower on NPF days. Sulfur dioxide and ozone might be main potentially precursor gases for those NPF events. The NPF events at Mt. Huang corresponded closely to a southwest winds. These results are useful for improving our understanding of the main factors controlling the variation of aerosol size distribution and NPF events in this region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
