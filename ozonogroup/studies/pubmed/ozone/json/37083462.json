Owing to the quality loss and short shelf-life in harvested mushrooms, it is necessary for the implementation of effective preservation and intelligent evaluation technologies to alleviate this issue. The aim of this review was to analyze the development and innovation thematic lines, topics, and trends by bibliometric analysis and review of the literature methods. The challenges faced in researching these topics were proposed and the mechanisms of quality loss in mushrooms during storage were updated. This review summarized the effects of chemical processing (antioxidants, ozone, and coatings), physical treatments (non-thermal plasma, packaging and latent thermal storage) and other emerging application on the quality of fresh mushrooms while discussing the efficiency in extending the shelf-life. It also discussed the emerging evaluation techniques based on the various chemometric methods and computer vision system in monitoring the freshness and predicting the shelf-life of mushrooms which have been developed. Preservation technology optimization and dynamic quality evaluation are vital for achieving mushroom quality control. This review can provide a comprehensive research reference for reducing mushroom quality loss and extending shelf-life, along with optimizing efficiency of storage and transportation operations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Rongrong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Zhenshan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Heran", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yunting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Academy of Food Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yafei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jiayi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zijian", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37083462", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2200482"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
