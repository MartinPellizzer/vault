In the control group, patients took oral valacyclovir tablets or granules (0.3 g per day, three times a day) and they were subjected to local weak laser irradiation treatment plus topical 2% mupirocin ointment twice a day. In the ozone group, the treatment is same as the control group except mupirocin ointment was replaced with topical ozone treatment (hydrotherapy every day plus ozonated oil twice a day). The clinical symptoms, discoid cell and adverse reactions were observed and taken records at day 0, 3, 7 and 14. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the clinical efficacy between the 2 groups. \u2029 Results: On the seventh day of treatment, the discoid cells of the ozone group disappeared, and the difference between the control group and the ozone group was statistically significant (P<0.05). The difference of decreased percentage of pain scores at each time point between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). The clinical efficacy was 100% in the ozone group and 86.7% in the control group, with significant difference between the 2 groups (P<0.05).\u2029 Conclusion: Topical ozone therapy in patients with herpes zoster is helpful in relieving pain, shortening the course as well as improving the clinical efficacy without obvious adverse reactions.
