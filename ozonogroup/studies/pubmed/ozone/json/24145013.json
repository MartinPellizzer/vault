When 200,000\u00a0m(3) of raw water at 10\u00a0NTU (Nepthelometric Turbidity Unit) was treated by a conventional WTP to 0.1\u00a0NTU using aluminum sulfate as a coagulant, the total CO2 emissions were estimated to be 790\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0228 (on-site) and 69,596\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03950 (off-site) kg\u00a0CO2e/d. The emissions from an advanced WTP containing micro-filtration (MF) membrane and ozone disinfection processes; treating the same raw water to 0.005\u00a0NTU, were estimated to be 395\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0115 (on-site) and 38,197\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02922 (off-site) kg\u00a0CO2e/d. The on-site CO2 emissions from the advanced WTP were half that from the conventional WTP due to much lower use of coagulant. On the other hand, off-site CO2 emissions due to consumption of electricity were 2.14 times higher for the advanced WTP, due to the demands for operation of the MF membrane and ozone disinfection processes. However, the lower use of chemicals in the advanced WTP decreased off-site CO2 emissions related to chemical production and transportation. Overall, total CO2 emissions from the conventional WTP were 1.82 times higher than that from the advanced WTP. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the advanced WTP to suggest tactics for simultaneously reducing CO2 emissions further and enhancing water quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
