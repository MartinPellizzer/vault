Improper disposal of medicated milk harms dairy production, animal welfare, and the environment. This work studies the use of ozonation in a vortex reactor for removing ceftiofur hydrochloride (CEF), sulfamonomethoxine sodium (SMM), marbofloxacin (MAR) and oxytetracycline (OTC) from milk. In terms of residual concentration, O<sub>3</sub> efficiency and the degradation kinetics of the various O<sub>3</sub>-involving processes in the vortex reactor, ABX removal via ozonation is better using stronger vortexing, which induces hydrodynamic cavitation. CEF undergoes the fastest degradation, followed by SMM, MAR, and OTC. High ABX hydrophobicity favors ABX degradation via ozonation, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. ABX oxidation by <sup>\u2022</sup>OH at the O<sub>3</sub> gas-bubble/milk interface is the principle degradation pathway, except for MAR. ABX degradation follows pseudo-first-order kinetics and is affected by initial ABX concentration, O<sub>3</sub> concentration/flow rate, reaction temperature, and milk components to varying degrees. Under optimal ozonation conditions, ABX residues meet the maximum limits as set by the European Commission and no antimicrobial activity was observed. The decontaminated milk was therefore suggested to be reused as calf food, animal feed, organic fertilizer, etc."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
