Although the benefits, there is a concern in terms of food quality and health due to the increasing consumption of phytosterols and the possible adverse side effects of their oxidation products, oxyphytosterols. \u03b2Sito has a similar structure to cholesterol, with an unsaturated double bond at C5-C6, which is susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species like ozone, generating oxyphytosterols. In this work we propose a mechanism of formation of three oxyphytosterols 2-[(7aR)-5-[(1R,4S)-4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxocyclohexyl]-1,7a-dimethyl-1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,7- octahydroinden-4-yl] acetaldehyde (\u03b2Sec), (2-[(7aR)-5-[(2R,5S)-5-hydroxy-2-methyl-7-oxo-oxepan- 2-yl]-1,7a-dimethyl-1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,7-octahydroinden-4- yl] acetaldehyde (\u03b2Lac) and 2-((7aR)-5-((1R,4S)-4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2- oxocyclohexyl)-1,7a-dimethyloctahydro-1Hinden-4-yl) acetic acid (\u03b2COOH) generated by ozonization of \u03b2Sito, through their synthesis and molecular characterization. The cytotoxic effect of \u03b2Sito and its main oxyphytosterol \u03b2Sec was evaluated and both reduced the HepG2 cell viability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
