Heading 1--Article 4 of the law states in particular that the right to information on air quality and its impact on the environment is recognised as the right of every person on French territory. The decree of 10 january, 2000, about the air-quality index is derived from this determination to information for all, stated as an important element in the policy for air-quality management. This decree provides definitions of the ATMO index with \"standards 2000\" and the recommendations required for its calculation. Previously (1992 and before), certain local agencies had developed their own index. Naturally these indices showed sizeable differences. The effort provided by the Ministry of the Environment, ADEME and the monitoring agencies, enabled the definition of a single index for the whole of the large urban areas (> 100,000 inhabitants). The index gives a common language to the non-specialist public, which can now understand the overall air quality in different urban areas. As all aggregate indicators of the same kind, the ATMO index is designed as a tool that makes it possible to translate in a quantitative and simple way the synthesis of numerous measurement data recorded daily by official air-quality monitoring agencies (AASQA)."]}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "L'indice ATMO: indicateur de la qualit\u00e9 de l'air dans les agglom\u00e9rations fran\u00e7aises."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Ann Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "101466614", "ISSNLinking": "1764-1489"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maximum Allowable Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12838780"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
