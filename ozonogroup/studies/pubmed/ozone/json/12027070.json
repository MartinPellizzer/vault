Sixty-three adolescent and adult asthmatic patients were randomized to receive at separate treatment visits single doses via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler of either placebo/hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134a; 100 microg, 200 microg, or 400 microg albuterol/HFA 134a; 100 microg or 200 microg albuterol/chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Triplicate measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were made immediately before dosing and 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours postdose. The primary efficacy variables were area under the entire 6-hour FEV1 curve, relative to baseline subtracted from the area above baseline (AUC(0-6)) and peak effect (derived from serial FEV1 measurements).", "Analysis of AUC(0-6) and peak effect showed that all doses of albuterol had a significantly greater effect than placebo (HFA 134a propellant). Comparisons of the two formulations at 100 microg and 200 microg showed no difference in AUC(0-6) (100 microg, -0.23 Lhr, P = 0.114 and 200 microg -0.08 Lhr, P = 0.590) or in peak effect, percentage of baseline (100 microg, -1.3%, P = 0.354 and 200 microg, 0.17%, P = 0.902). There were no differences seen among formulations in the incidence of adverse events or with any of the other safety parameters, including electrocardiograms, vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and asthma exacerbations.", "The study demonstrated comparability in terms of efficacy and safety between albuterol/HFA 134a and albuterol/CFC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicines Evaluation Unit, North West Lung Research Center, Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom. slangley@meu.org.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Langley", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sykes", "ForeName": "Andrew P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Batty", "ForeName": "Elizabeth P", "Initials": "EP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masterson", "ForeName": "Catherine M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodcock", "ForeName": "Ashley", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosol Propellants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QF8SVZ843E", "NameOfSubstance": "Albuterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R40P36GDK6", "NameOfSubstance": "apaflurane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosol Propellants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Albuterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchodilator Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorofluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Headache"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Tremor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12027070", "10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62387-3", "S1081-1206(10)62387-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
