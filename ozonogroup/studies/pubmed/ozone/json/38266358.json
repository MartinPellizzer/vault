A satellite-based spatiotemporal model was applied to assess three-year annual averages of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2264\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), \u2264\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at residential address. Poor cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess associations.", "Compared with participants with the lowest quartiles of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> levels, those with the second, third, and highest quartiles of air pollutants consistently showed increased odds of poor cognitive function and decreased MMSE scores. The odds ratios of poor cognitive function associated with a 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> were 1.26 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.17, 1.36), 1.06 (95 %CI: 1.04, 1.08), and 2.76 (95 %CI: 2.11, 3.62), respectively. Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations between air pollution exposures and poor cognitive function among participants who were younger, were non-Uyghur and were physically active.", "Long-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were associated with poor cognitive function in elders.
