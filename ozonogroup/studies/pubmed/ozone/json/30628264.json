Gas samples in the tunnel were collected with 3.2 L stainless steel canisters and 99 VOCs species were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentration levels, variation characteristics, and EFs of the VOCs were analyzed. The ozone formation potentials (OFPs) and secondary organic aerosol formation potentials (SOAFPs) of the VOCs in the tunnel were calculated. Moreover, a comparison of the study results with current literature was conducted. The total concentrations of VOCs at the inlet and midpoint are (190.85\u00b151.15) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and (257.44\u00b162.02) \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The total EFs are (45.12\u00b110.97) mg\u00b7(km\u00b7veh)<sup>-1</sup> and the EFs for alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, halocarbons, and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) are (22.79\u00b17.15), (5.04\u00b11.20), (0.78\u00b10.34), (9.86\u00b12.81), (0.26\u00b10.17), and (6.25\u00b12.27) mg\u00b7(km\u00b7veh)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. They are notably smaller than the values obtained in a previous test in 2009. Isopentane, toluene, ethylene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and ethane were the top five species among the VOC EFs. The ratios of methyl tert-butyl ether/benzene (MTBE/B) and methyl tert-butyl ether/toluene (MTBE/T) are 1.07 and 0.77, respectively. This implies that the contribution of evaporative emissions from vehicles to VOCs emissions cannot be ignored. The OFPs and SOAFPs in the tunnel are (145.50\u00b137.85) and (43.87\u00b112.75) mg\u00b7(km\u00b7veh)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Compared with the test in 2009, the OFPs and SOAFPs are 94.23% and 90.88% smaller, respectively. The sharp decrease of the OFPs and SOAFPs is closely related to stricter emission standards and the upgrade of oil products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Lu-Na", "Initials": "LN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jing-Bo", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Shi-da", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Cong-Bo", "Initials": "CB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ning", "Initials": "YN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ying-Chao", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urban Transport Emission Control Research Centre, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Hong-Jun", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30628264", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201804187"]}}]}
