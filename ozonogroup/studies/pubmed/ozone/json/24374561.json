The catalyst was directly prepared by the reuse of fly ash and sawdust after saturated adsorption of nickel ions from wastewater, which was proposed as an efficient and economic approach. The obtained catalyst was characterized by TGA, BET, FTIR, XRD, and SEM, the results showed that fly ash as the basic framework has high specific surface area and the addition of sawdust as the porogen agent could improve the pore structure of the catalyst. The adsorption of nickel ions by fly ash and sawdust from aqueous solution was also investigated in this study. The results obtained from the experiments indicated that adsorption of nickel ions by fly ash and biomass sawdust could be well described by Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetic model. The catalytic performance of catalyst was studied in terms of the effect of time, liquid-solid ratio and pH on 2-chlorophenol ozonation degradation. It was found that the catalyst could effectively improve the ozonation reaction rate at pH=7 with a 2:1 liquid-solid ratio. The kinetic study demonstrated that the reaction followed the first order model, and the rate constant increased 267% (0.03-0.1 min(-1)) of 2-chlorophenol ozonation degradation with 5 mmol/L concentration at pH=7.0 compared with ozonation alone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.
