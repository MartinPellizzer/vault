Self-assembled monolayers consisting of silane-coupling agent with hydrophobic groups were fabricated on plastic sheets. UV-ozone treatments were performed through a metal mask to selectively remove the self-assembled monolayers in a patterned manner, resulting in the formation of wettability-patterned surfaces on plastic sheets. Using a water dispersion of Er(3+) and Yb(3+)-codoped Y2O3 nanoparticles at a diameter of 100 nm, RE-nanoparticle films were fabricated on the wettability-patterned surfaces by a dip-coating technique. By adjusting the concentration of RE-nanoparticle dispersion, withdrawal speed, and withdrawal angle, amount of RE-nanoparticles, we were able to control the structures of the RE-nanoparticle films. Fluorescence microscope observations demonstrate that visible upconversion luminescence and near-infrared fluorescence were emitted from the RE-nanoparticle films on the wettability-patterned surfaces. This technique allows for the fabrication of flexible emitting devices with long-operating life time with minimized material consumption and few fabrication steps, and for the application to sensors, emitting devices, and displays in electronics, photonics, and bionics in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.
