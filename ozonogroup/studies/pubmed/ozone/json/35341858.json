In this study, linear regression analyses of long-term O<sub>3</sub> data in suburban Hong Kong revealed that the variation of autumn O<sub>3</sub> obviously leveled off during 2005-2017, mainly due to the significant decrease of autumn O<sub>3</sub> in 2013-2017 (period II), despite the increase in 2005-2012 (period I). In addition, the rise of O<sub>3</sub> in summer and winter also ceased since 2013. In contrary, O<sub>3</sub> continuously increased throughout the spring of 2005-2017, especially in period II. Consequently, an incessant increase of overall O<sub>3</sub> was observed during 2005-2017. A statistical model combining Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter with multiple linear regressions, and a photochemical box model incorporating CB05 mechanism were applied to probe the causes of the above trends. In general, O<sub>3</sub> production was controlled by VOC-limited regime throughout 13 years. The meteorological variability and regional transport facilitated the O<sub>3</sub> growth in period \u0399. In contrast, the unchanged O<sub>3</sub> level in period II was attributable to the negative impact of meteorological variability and reduction of regional transport effect on O<sub>3</sub> formation and accumulation, as well as the negligible change in locally-produced O<sub>3</sub>. In autumn of period II, the inhibitory meteorological variability, reduced regional transport, and alleviated local production were the driving force for the hard-earned decrease of O<sub>3</sub>. However, the remarkable rise of spring O<sub>3</sub> was caused by the reduction of NO<sub>x</sub>, especially in the spring of period II. The findings of the long-term and seasonal variations of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Hong Kong are helpful for future O<sub>3</sub> mitigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
