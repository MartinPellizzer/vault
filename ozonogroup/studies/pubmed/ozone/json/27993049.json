Previous research using Formation Potential (FP) chloramination protocols (high dose and prolonged contact times) raised concerns about precursor loadings from various source water categories, but differences in the protocols employed rendered comparisons difficult. In this study, we applied Uniform Formation Condition (UFC) chloramination and ozonation protocols mimicking typical disinfection practice to compare loadings of ambient specific and total N-nitrosamines as well as chloramine-reactive and ozone-reactive precursors in 47 samples, including 6 pristine headwaters, 16 eutrophic waters, 4 agricultural runoff samples, 9 stormwater runoff samples, and 12 municipal wastewater effluents. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation from UFC and FP chloramination protocols did not correlate, with NDMA FP often being significant in samples where no NDMA formed under UFC conditions. N-Nitrosamines and their precursors were negligible in pristine headwaters. Conventional, and to a lesser degree, nutrient removal wastewater effluents were the dominant source of NDMA and its chloramine- and ozone-reactive precursors. While wastewater effluents were dominant sources of TONO and their precursors, algal blooms, and to a lesser degree agricultural or stormwater runoff, could be important where they affect a major fraction of the water supply."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt), 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Syracuse University , 151 Link Hall, Syracuse, New York 13244, United States."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Teng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Quality Research and Development Division, Southern Nevada Water Authority , Henderson, Nevada 89015, United States."}], "LastName": "Glover", "ForeName": "Caitlin M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Quality Research and Development Division, Southern Nevada Water Authority , Henderson, Nevada 89015, United States."}], "LastName": "Marti", "ForeName": "Erica J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Quality Research and Development Division, Southern Nevada Water Authority , Henderson, Nevada 89015, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HDR, Inc., 431 W Baseline Road, Claremont, California 91711, United States."}], "LastName": "Woods-Chabane", "ForeName": "Gwen C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, Clemson University , 342 Computer Court, Anderson, South Carolina 29625, United States."}], "LastName": "Karanfil", "ForeName": "Tanju", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4917-0938"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University , 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt), 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, California 94305, United States."}], "LastName": "Mitch", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Water Quality Research and Development Division, Southern Nevada Water Authority , Henderson, Nevada 89015, United States."}], "LastName": "Dickenson", "ForeName": "Eric R V", "Initials": "ER"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27993049", "10.1021/acs.est.6b04650"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
