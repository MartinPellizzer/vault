If objectivity is relevant, then rates are for cross-country comparisons and numbers are for impact. 2) Twice as many people has resulted in taking better care of trees and soils. The context is important where less populated countries may be more environmentally concerned, and one can ignore that twice as many people may mean twice as much food and fuel use. There is no convincing empirical evidence even with intermediate variables. 3) Land and materials no longer set limits; the more people, the more brains, the more ideas, and the more technology to circumvent environmental limits. Land has been superseded by productivity advances due to technology. Capital accounts for maybe 10% of economic progress. Technology has transformed but also produced the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, and the extinction of species. Those in less developed countries want few people and more land and capital. 4) Ignoring nonlinearities and discontinuities, countries with controlled population and rapid population growth have experienced similar patterns of slow income growth. 16% of economic growth is accounted for by lower population growth. However, economic growth may be due to other factors, such as economic riches in oil. A critical point is reached where renewable resources eventually decline. 5) The market will produce an optimum of people, if parents get all the benefits and pay all the costs of having children. Fertility reduction leads to loss of utility. The impact of this decision to bear children without social limits on others must be considered. Net externalities may occur within the nuclear family where the husband plans family size and the wife raises the child; within the community where couples plan the child and the community educates the child; and between the present and future generations where present childbearing affects future welfare. 6) Eliminate the environment from a production model. 7) Fault bad economic policies when rapid population growth occurs. This diversion may focus on bad technology such as replacing fossil fuels with solar energy, wrong economic policies such as in the need to trust the market more. The social and political issues are difficult to resolve. People want to live in the wrong places. Dualism in formal and informal economies occurs. The population problem must not be sidestepped."]}], "OtherID": ["8021650", "074103", "00213106"], "PMID": "12158966", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "02"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0168-6577", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992"}}, "Title": "European journal of population = Revue europeenne de demographie", "ISOAbbreviation": "Eur J Popul"}, "ArticleTitle": "Seven ways of causing the less developed countries' population problem to disappear -- in theory.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "149", "EndPage": "167", "MedlinePgn": "149-67"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keyfitz", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Popul", "NlmUniqueID": "8511777", "ISSNLinking": "0168-6577"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Efficiency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organization and Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poverty"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Planning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Popul Index. 1991 Spring;57(1):5-22", "ArticleIdList": ["12285099"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12158966", "10.1007/BF01797550"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
