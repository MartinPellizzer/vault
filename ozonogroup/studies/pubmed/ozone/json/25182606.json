To reduce the risk of bio-invasion, ballast water should be treated before discharge. In this study, the efficiencies of several conventional and advanced oxidation processes were investigated for potential ballast water treatment, using a marine dinoflagellate species, Scripsiella trochoidea, as the indicator organism. A stable and consistent culture was obtained and treated by ultraviolet (UV) light, ozone (O3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and their various combinations. UV apparently inactivated the cells after only 10\u2005s of irradiation, but subsequently photo-reactivation of the cells was observed for all methods involving UV. O3 exhibited 100% inactivation efficiency after 5\u2005min treatment, while H2O2 only achieved maximum 80% inactivation in the same duration. Combined methods, e.g. UV/O3 and UV/H2O2, were found to inhibit photo-reactivation and improve treatment efficiency to some degree, indicating the effectiveness of using combined treatment processes. The total residual oxidant (TRO) levels of the methods were determined, and the results indicated that UV and O3 generated the lowest and highest TRO, respectively. The synergic effect of combined processes on TRO generation was found to be insignificant, and thus UV/O3 was recommended as a potentially suitable treatment process for ballast water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Architecture and Environment, Sichuan University , Chengdu 610065 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhishan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wenju", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dinoflagellida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ships"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25182606", "10.1080/09593330.2014.960478"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
