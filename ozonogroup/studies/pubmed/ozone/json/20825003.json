Air quality was measured by automatic on-line continuous monitoring equipments in summer and autumn of 2007 and 2008. The objectives of this study were to identify the effect of pollutants decrease on atmospheric environment, and develop the potential influence to Beijing and surrounding areas. The results show that the pollutants concentration often exceeds state criterion except nitrogen oxides, O3 concentration in summer and autumn is higher, averaged hourly maximum concentration (O3-Max) is (177.2 +/- 63.0) and (105.8 +/- 61.7) microg x m(-3), the concentrations of NO and NO2 are (4.5 +/- 4.0), (32.7 +/- 12.4) microg x m(-3) and (21.5 +/- 16.9), (60.5 +/- 16.9) microg x m(-3) respectively, SO2 concentration is (72.0 +/- 27.5) and (92.0 +/- 44.4) microg x m(-3), PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations reach to (102.3 +/- 47.6), (153.3 +/- 58.3) microg x m(-3) and (95.8 +/- 50.0), (147.4 +/- 67.0) microg x m(-3). Generally, pollutants declined obviously in Olympics period, the concentrations of NOx, O3-Max, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 are (43.8 +/- 15.0), (142.0 +/- 54.9), (52.4 +/- 18.8), (76.7 +/- 35.1) and (116.5 +/- 38.8) microg x m(-3), and the reduction ratio of SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 are 34.6%, 22.8% and 21.0% compared with the whole monitoring period in 2008. The actuality of atmospheric pollution in summer and autumn was analyzed systemically, and which provided scientific evidences for evaluating the control measures of pollutants emission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China. duwupeng@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Wu-peng", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-si", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Jin-yuan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yi-song", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Dong-sheng", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20825003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
