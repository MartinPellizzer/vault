This study reports a novel UVA/chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) AOP based on the photolysis of ClO<sub>2</sub> using energy-efficient UV radiation sources in the UVA range (e.g., UVA-LEDs). At a ClO<sub>2</sub> dosage of 74 \u03bcM (5.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup> as ClO<sub>2</sub>) and a UV fluence at 47.5 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>, the UVA<sub>365</sub>/ClO<sub>2</sub> AOP generated a spectrum of reactive species, including chlorine oxide radicals (ClO<sup>\u2022</sup>), chlorine atoms (Cl<sup>\u2022</sup>), hydroxyl radicals (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>), and ozone at a concentration of \u223c10<sup>-13</sup>, \u223c10<sup>-15</sup>, \u223c10<sup>-14</sup>, and \u223c10<sup>-7</sup> M, respectively. A kinetic model to simulate the reactive species generation in the UVA<sub>365</sub>/ClO<sub>2</sub> AOP was established, validated against the experimental results, and used to predict the pseudo-first-order rate constants and relative contributions of different reactive species to the degradation of 19 micropollutants in the UVA<sub>365</sub>/ClO<sub>2</sub> AOP. Compared to the well-documented UVC<sub>254</sub>/chlorine AOP, the UVA<sub>365</sub>/ClO<sub>2</sub> AOP produced similar levels of reactive species at similar oxidant dosages but was much less pH-dependent and required much lower energy input, with much lower formation of chloro-organic byproducts and marginal formation of chlorite and chlorate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jiadong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0056-8347"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Ran", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9860-423X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3360-7891"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hong Kong Branch of Chinese National Engineering Research Center for Control & Treatment of Heavy Metal Pollution, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Chii", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "7"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34978792", "10.1021/acs.est.1c05133"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
