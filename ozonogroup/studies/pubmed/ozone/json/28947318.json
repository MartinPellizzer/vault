The data were linked to data on the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and fine particulate matter with a median aerometric diameter of less than 10 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, respectively), which were obtained from the Environmental Protection Department of Zhejiang Province. A time-stratified case-crossover study design and conditional logistic regression were applied to analyze the association between air pollutants and outpatient visits for conjunctivitis.", "A 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO concentrations on the same day as the hospital visit or on lag days before the hospital visit date was associated with outpatient visits for conjunctivitis. The strongest association was observed between SO<sub>2</sub> and conjunctivitis patients aged 2-5 years.
