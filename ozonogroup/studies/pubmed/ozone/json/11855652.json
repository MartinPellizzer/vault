Up to 5% of the O3 taken up diffused through the leaf and emerged from the stomata on the upper surface, suggesting above-zero O3 concentrations in the leaf intercellular air space, [O3]i. Moreover, measurements revealed that [O3]i increased during exposure to the pollutant. Time patterns of O3 fluxes through the gas phase and into the aqueous apoplast indicated that the increase in [O3]i was the result of a decrease in the diffusion-reaction conductance of the aqueous apoplast, gaq. Under an intense O3 pulse, gaq approached the value of the pure diffusional conductance within 2.5 min of exposure, suggesting the exhaustion of protective resources in the leaf apoplast. Toward the end of the exposure gaq tended to increase, suggesting either a recovery in the protective resources in the leaf apoplast and/or the induction of new defences. The possibility of estimating the degree of protection afforded by apoplast constituents and the rate of recovery of these protective systems in intact leaves using brief O3 pulses is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Estonia. hei@ut.ee"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moldau", "ForeName": "Heino", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bichele", "ForeName": "Irina", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phaseolus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Transpiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11855652", "10.1007/s00425-001-0678-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
