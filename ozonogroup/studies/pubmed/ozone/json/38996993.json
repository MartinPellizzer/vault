The relationship between maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations and the extremely strong and westward-extended WPSH occurred in 2022 is investigated using observations, reanalysis data and atmospheric chemistry model simulations. During July-August 2022, a significant positive relationship existed between the intensity of the WPSH and MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> over southern China, with a correlation coefficient of +0.44, but the correlation is negative (-0.40) in northern China. During the strong WPSH days, MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> increased by 16.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (16.4% relative to July-August average) over southern China and decreased by 19.0 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> (14.5%) in northern China compared to the weak WPSH days. The unique dipole pattern in the relationship between ozone levels and the WPSH in 2022 exhibited a contrast to that during 2015-2021. The difference is primarily due to the extremely strong WPSH intensity and its unusual westward expansion in 2022. In this case, an anomalous anticyclone at 500 hPa dominates over southern China, which creates conditions conducive for ozone formation and accumulation. The anticyclone weakened horizontal winds and reduced the dispersion of ozone, alongside a high temperature and low relative humidity, which favored the chemical production of ozone. In contrast, abnormal northerly winds enhanced ozone diffusion in northern China and the low temperature reduced ozone chemical production. This study reveals the mechanism for the significant impact of strong and westward-extended WPSH on ozone concentrations over China, emphasizing the role of the WPSH location in modulating meteorology and ozone levels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
