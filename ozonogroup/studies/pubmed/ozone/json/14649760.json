Continuous emissions monitoring data were analyzed for 1995 and 1998 for 32 units from nine baseload power plants in the Charlotte, NC, airshed. Unit emissions have a strong 24-hr cycle attributable primarily to the capacity factor. Typical ranges of the coefficient of variation for emissions at a given hour of the day were from 0.2 to 0.45. Little difference was found when comparing weekend emissions with the entire week or when comparing the O3 season with the entire year. There were substantial differences in the mean and standard deviation of emissions when comparing 1995 and 1998 data, indicative of the effect of retrofits of control technology during the intervening time. The wide range of variability and its autocorrelation should be accounted for when developing probabilistic utility emission inventories for analysis of near-term future episodes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Aziz", "ForeName": "Amr", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frey", "ForeName": "H Christopher", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decision Making"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14649760", "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466298"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
