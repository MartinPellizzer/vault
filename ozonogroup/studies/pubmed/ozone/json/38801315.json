However, MTX induces male reproductive toxicity. In the current study, the effect of ozone therapy (OT) on reducing the toxic effects of MTX in the mouse testicles has been investigated.", "Twenty-four mice were divided into four groups: control, OT (4 mg/kg ozone), MTX (20 mg/kg), and MTX + OT. Testosterone levels, histological changes, and oxidative stress biomarkers were assessed to evaluate the protective effects of OT.", "The results demonstrated that MTX disrupted germinal epithelium, reduced serum testosterone levels, and enhanced oxidative stress in testicular tissue. However, treatment with OT attenuated these adverse effects. OT effectively restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). OT reduced lipid peroxidation, as indicated by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. OT preserved normal spermatogenesis, improved morphometric parameters, and reduced histological changes by MTX. Moreover, OT effectively restored testosterone levels.", "OT protects against MTX-induced testicular damage by suppressing oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences Medical Basic Sciences Research Institute Cellular and Molecular Research Center Ahvaz Iran Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Medical Basic Sciences Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences Department of Anatomical Sciences Faculty of Medicine Ahvaz Iran Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorsandi", "ForeName": "Layasadat", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fasa University of Medical Sciences Department of Anatomical Sciences Faculty of Medicine Fasa Iran Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran."}], "LastName": "Varaa", "ForeName": "Negar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AJA University of Medical Sciences Department of Anatomical Sciences Faculty of Medicine Tehran Iran Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dadfar", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ahvaz jundishapur university of Medical Sciences physiology research center Department of physiology Ahvaz Iran Department of physiology, faculty of medicine, physiology research center, Ahvaz jundishapur university of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vastegani", "ForeName": "Sadegh Moradi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Arak University of Medical Sciences Department of Anatomical Sciences Faculty of Medicine Arak Iran Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Asadi-Fard", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ahvaz jundishapur university of Medical Sciences physiology research center Department of physiology Ahvaz Iran Department of physiology, faculty of medicine, physiology research center, Ahvaz jundishapur university of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahangarpour", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences Department of Anatomical Sciences Faculty of Medicine Ahvaz Iran Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences Student Research Committee Ahvaz Iran Student Research Committee, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarz-Zarjani", "ForeName": "Amirhesam", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "JBRA Assist Reprod", "NlmUniqueID": "101684552", "ISSNLinking": "1517-5693"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38801315", "10.5935/1518-0557.20240041"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
