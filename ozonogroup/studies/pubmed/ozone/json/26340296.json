Stomatal conductance (gs) of five poplar clones was measured to parameterize a Jarvis-type multiplicative gs model. The maximum gs and other model parameters varied between clones. The strongest relationship between stomatal O3 flux and total biomass was obtained when phytotoxic ozone dose (POD) was integrated using an uptake rate threshold of 7\u00a0nmol\u00a0m(-2)\u00a0s(-1). The R(2) value was similar between flux-based and concentration-based dose-response relationships. Ozone concentrations above 28-36\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol(-1) contributed to reducing the biomass production of poplar. Critical levels of AOT40 (accumulated O3 exposure over 40\u00a0nmol\u00a0mol(-1)) and POD7 in relation to 5% reduction in total biomass for poplar were 12\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol(-1)\u00a0h and 3.8\u00a0mmol\u00a0m(-2), respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
