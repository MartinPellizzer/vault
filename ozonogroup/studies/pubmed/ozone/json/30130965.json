Here we report on the emissions of ODSs and their substitute from China, which is currently the largest consumer (and emitter) of these substances. We provide, for the first time, comprehensive information on ODSs and replacement hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions in China starting from 1980 based on reported production and usage. We also assess the impacts (and costs) of controls on ODS consumption and emissions on the ozone layer (in terms of CFC-11-equivalent) and climate (in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent). In addition, we show that while China's future ODS emissions are likely to be defined as long as there is full compliance with the Montreal Protocol; its HFC emissions through 2050 are very uncertain. Our findings imply that HFC controls over the next decades that are more stringent than those under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol would be beneficial in mitigating global climate change."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Global Change Science , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory for Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering , Peking University , Beijing 100871 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7055-0644"], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Xuekun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Department of Atmospheric Science , Colorado State University , Fort Collins , Colorado 80523 , United States."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9059-8437"], "LastName": "Ravishankara", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) , P.O.
