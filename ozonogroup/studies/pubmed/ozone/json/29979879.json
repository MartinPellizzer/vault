This study reports the application of a combination technique of laser flash photolysis generation and laser-induced fluorescence detection for the direct kinetic measurement of OH uptake onto deliquesced NaCl particles. The uptake coefficient was not constant and inversely depended on the initial OH concentration, indicating that the first uptake step is Langmuir-type adsorption. The resistance model, including surface processes, well reproduced the observed uptake coefficient. The model predicted an uptake coefficient for the atmospheric relevant OH concentration within the range from 0.77 to 0.95. Such values may lead to emissions of Cl<sub>2</sub> higher than those predicted in previous studies based on other values. Hence, the proposed value may provide more reliable estimations of ozone formation, oxidation of volatile organic compounds, secondary organic aerosol formation, and lifetime of methane and elemental mercury in the marine boundary layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Regional Environmental Research , National Institute for Environmental Studies , Ibaraki 305-8506 , Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-9863-4241"], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Yosuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohno", "ForeName": "Nanase", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakagawa", "ForeName": "Maho", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental Earth Science , Hokkaido University , Sapporo 060-0810 , Japan."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-1647-4799"], "LastName": "Hirokawa", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Regional Environmental Research , National Institute for Environmental Studies , Ibaraki 305-8506 , Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kajii", "ForeName": "Yoshizumi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101526034", "ISSNLinking": "1948-7185"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29979879", "10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01725"]}}]}
