Here, Na, K, Rb, and Cs-OMS-2-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared, characterized and evaluated for catalytic ozonation of toluene. Both characterizations and DFT calculations showed that the appropriate alkali metal introduction made the catalyst possess with appropriate crystalline, reducibility, and acidity, which was favorable for catalytic ozonation of toluene. Characterizations also showed that alkali metal introduction resulted in water molecule adsorption on Br\u00f6nsted acid sites of the catalysts, which made water molecule activation by ozone to form \u00b7OH more easily. The introduction of K<sup>+</sup> content of \u223c\u00a05.9\u00a0wt% yielded K-OMS-2-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/ZSM-5 catalyst with the highest Br\u00f6nsted acid sites and thus formed the most \u00b7OH among the five prepared catalysts. As a result, the catalyst exhibited excellent toluene conversion and CO<sub>x</sub> selectivity for catalytic ozonation of toluene at room temperature and ambient humidity. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of deactivated K-OMS-2-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/ZSM-5 catalyst was recovered after regeneration by a combination of water washing and heat treatment. Finally, a complete mechanism for toluene catalytic ozonation, catalyst deactivation, and regeneration was proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
