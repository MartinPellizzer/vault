In this study, which has had the aim of extending the shelf life of beefsteaks, pilot-scale treatments were carried out with aqueous ozone (AO) and electrolyzed water (EW) before vacuum packaging (VP). The development of the potentially active microbiota and the associated volatilome were followed over 15days of storage under refrigerated conditions (4\u00b0C), in order to define the potential long-term effects of the treatments and storage condition on microbiota. The targeted RNA-based amplicon sequencing identified Pseudomonas fragi as the most frequent species before and after the treatments with AO and EW, as well as in the untreated control. The tested treatments did not reduce the overall presence of this species, but they affected the intra-species distribution of its oligotypes, albeit slightly. With the progression of the refrigerated storage and the reduction of the oxygen availability, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc gasicomitatum and Lactococcus piscium became the dominant, potentially active, beef microbiota, as confirmed by microbiological data. When the OTU abundances and volatilome were coupled, a significant association was observed between the organic acids, esters and aldehydes and these lactic acid bacteria species. In spite of the limited effectiveness of the treatments over the short and long term, this study has provided a detailed view of beef spoilage using RNA as the sequencing target, strengthening and confirming the current knowledge based on DNA-amplicon sequencing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
