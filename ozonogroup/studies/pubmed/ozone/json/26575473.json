Under different ozone dosages (0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09, 0.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11 and 2.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0mgO3/mg\u00a0DOC), the EfOM before and after ozonation could be classified into four fractions according to their hydrophobicities. By ozonation, the hydrophobic fractions, especially hydrophobic acid (HOA) and hydrophobic neutral (HON), were found to undergo a process of transformation into hydrophilic fractions (HI), of which the HOA were first transformed into HON, and then the majority of the HON fraction was later converted to HI by further ozonation. It was noticeable that after ozonation, the fluorescence intensity in the humic-like and protein-like regions decreased as indicated by the excitation and emission matrix (EEM) spectra for the hydrophobic fractions. By coupling the EEM spectra with the molecular size analysis using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), the difference between the characteristic distributions of the humic-like and protein-like fluorophores were further revealed. It could thus be extrapolated that ozone might have preferentially reacted with the protein-like hydrophobic fraction with molecular weight (MW) less than 100\u00a0kDa. Moreover, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, it was identified that with increasing ozone dosage (from 0 to 2.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0mgO3/mg\u00a0DOC), the aromaticity of HON decreased dramatically, while aliphatics and ketones increased especially at the low ozone dose (0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0mgO3/mg\u00a0DOC). Of the EfOM fractions, the HON fraction would have a higher content of electron enriched aromatics which could preferentially react with ozone rather than the HOA fraction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
