Analyses of the XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) data, acquired throughout the in situ experiments, show a dioxo coordination environment for Pu(VI), PuO(2)(2+), typical for it and the hexavalent actinyl species of U and Np, and its evolution into a tetraoxo-coordination environment for Pu(VII), PuO(4)(-), like that known for Np(VII). The EXAFS data provide average Pu-O distances of 1.79(1) and 1.88(1) \u00c5, respectively. The second coordination shells, also fit as O atoms, provide Pu-O distances of 2.29-2.32 \u00c5 that are independent of the Pu oxidation state. The coordination numbers for the distant O atoms in sums with those for the nearest O atoms are consistent with 6-O environments for both Pu(VI) and Pu(VII) ions in accordance with their previously proposed speciation as [Pu(VI)O(2)(OH)(4)](2-) and [Pu(VII)O(4)(OH)(2)](3-), respectively. This solution speciation accounts precisely for the Pu(VI) and Pu(VII) coordination environments reported in various solid state structures. The Pu(VII) tetraoxo-dihydroxo anion was found to have a half-life of 3.7 h. Its instability is attributed to spontaneous reduction to Pu(VI) and not to a measurable extent of disproportionation. We found no direct evidence for Pu(VIII) in the X-ray data and, furthermore, the stoichiometry of the oxidation of Cr(III) by Pu is consistent with that expected for a valence-pure Pu(VII) preparation by ozonation and, in turn, stoichiometrically equivalent to the established Np(VII)/Cr(III) redox reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA. mantonio@anl.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antonio", "ForeName": "Mark R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sullivan", "ForeName": "James A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skanthakumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yung-Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soderholm", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Inorg Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0366543", "ISSNLinking": "0020-1669"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22524489", "10.1021/ic300205h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
