In the aforementioned review, relevant impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as on biochemical cycles and man, have been discussed. Special attention has been paid to the analysis of observed and potential impacts of enhanced UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. In this context, possibilities remote sensing techniques applications aimed at obtaining more complete information on atmospheric concentrations of various trace gases determining the ozone content have been considered in the present paper.An overview of the ozone issues is given including the following aspects: 1. The impact of tropospheric ozone on climate as a greenhouse gas (GHG), 2. Solar activity effects on TO and ozone concentration vertical profiles in both the troposphere and stratosphere (in cases of solar radiation absorption by the stratosphere, an unexpected problem arises via a coupling between processes of increased absorption due to \"bursts\" of solar activity and an enhanced destruction of ozone molecules due to the same increase resulting in weakening UV radiation absorption) and 3. Surface ozone concentration variations under conditions of polluted urban atmospheres which lead to episodes of photochemical smog formation (dangerous for human health)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Ecological Safety, Russian Academy of Sciences, 18 Korpusnaya Str., 197042, St. Petersburg, Russia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kondratyev", "ForeName": "K Y", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varotsos", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 1996 Sep;3(3):153-7", "ArticleIdList": ["24235054"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24233417", "10.1007/BF02986960"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
