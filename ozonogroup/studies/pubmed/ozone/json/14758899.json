The experimental results showed that the ozone concentration reduced with applied voltage decrease. With heating power increase, the ozone concentration of unit current decreased at exponential rate and it almost change no longer over 0.40 W. Under given temperature, the lower the applied voltage was, the smaller the ozone concentration was; while under given applied voltages, only over 11 kV could decrease with the surface temperature increase. The ozone concentration decreased with the lengthening of corona wire, and could reduced to 10 ppb under experimental condition of 14.2 kV; it also decreased with the shortening of wire diameter, and could decrease 67% at best in the given condition. Moreover, it decreased with the increasing size of netting electrode mesh. At the anion current of 1.65 microA, the ozone concentration of 5.0 x 5.0 cm2 is only 41% of that of 3.3 x 3.3 cm2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China. hjwangnenu@163.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hai-jun", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Lian-xi", "Initials": "LX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "De-xuan", "Initials": "DX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heating"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14758899"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
