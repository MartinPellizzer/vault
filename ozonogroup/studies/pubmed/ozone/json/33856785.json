Herein, the annual variations in the isotopic compositions of total gaseous Hg (TGM), with 5-22 days of sampling duration for each sample, were presented for the first time to provide isotopic evidence of the sources and environmental processes of gaseous Hg around the Chinese Great Wall Station (GWS) in the western Antarctic. Different from the Arctic tundra and lower latitude areas in the northern hemisphere, positive \u03b4<sup>202</sup>Hg (0.58 \u00b1 0.21\u2030, mean \u00b1 1SD) and negative \u0394<sup>199</sup>Hg (-0.30 \u00b1 0.10\u2030, mean \u00b1 1SD) in TGM at the GWS indicated little impact from the vegetation-air exchange in the Antarctic. Correlations among TGM \u0394<sup>199</sup>Hg, air temperature, and ozone concentrations suggested that enhanced katabatic wind that transported inland air masses to the continental margin elevated TGM \u0394<sup>199</sup>Hg in the austral winter, while the surrounding marine surface emissions controlled by sea-ice dynamics lowered TGM \u0394<sup>199</sup>Hg in the austral summer. The oxidation of Hg(0) might elevate \u0394<sup>199</sup>Hg in TGM during atmospheric Hg depletion events but have little impact on the seasonal variations of atmospheric Hg isotopes. The presented atmospheric Hg isotopes were essential to identify the transport and transformation of atmospheric Hg and further understand Hg cycling in the Antarctic."]}, "AuthorList":
