In this study, we conducted a one-month observation (from June 15 to July 14, 2016) of the boundary layer meteorological factors as well as O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors in Luancheng County, Shijiazhuang (37\u00b053'N, 114\u00b038'E). Our research showed that photochemical pollution in Shijiazhuang is serious, and the mean hourly maximum and mean 8-hr maximum O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are 97.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f26.1 and 84.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f22.4\u202fppbV, respectively. Meteorological factors play a significant role in the formation of O<sub>3</sub>. High temperatures and southeasterly winds lead to elevated O<sub>3</sub> values, and at moderate relative humidity (40%-50%) and medium boundary layer heights (1200-1500\u202fm), O<sub>3</sub> production sensitivity occurred in the transitional region between volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) limitations, and the O<sub>3</sub> concentration was the highest. The vertical profiles of O<sub>3</sub> were also measured by a tethered balloon. The results showed that a large amount of O<sub>3</sub> was stored in the residual layer, and the concentration was positively correlated with the O<sub>3</sub> concentration measured the previous day. During the daytime of the following day, the contribution of O<sub>3</sub> stored in the residual layer to the boundary layer reached 27%\u202f\u00b1\u202f7% on average."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
