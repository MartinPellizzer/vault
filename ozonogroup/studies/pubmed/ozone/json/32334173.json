This, however, is well justified only in temperate regions. In this study, we aim to investigate the temporal association between ambient temperature, seasonal influenza and risk of cardiovascular events in a subtropical city.", "Generalized additive model was used in conjunction with distributed-lag non-linear model of quasi-Poisson family to estimate the association of interest with daily CVD admissions as outcome and daily influenza admissions as predictor, while controlling for meteorological factors (i.e. temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and total rainfall) and respiratory pollutants (i.e. nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and PM<sub>10</sub>). Results were expressed in the form of relative risk (RR).", "Using median as the reference value, a U-shaped association was observed between CVD admissions and temperature. A slight decrease in RR was detected mainly towards the lower end of the temperature scale after adjusting for influenza admissions. Risk of CVD admission was found to be positively associated with the number of influenza hospitalization cases; this association remained consistent and statistically significant across subgroups of age except for those aged 5-49 years.", "The slight reduction in CVD admission risk towards the lower end of the temperature scale after controlling for influenza activity might be attributed to the winter peaks of influenza, meaning that the effect of low temperature on CVD admissions might be partly mediated by influenza infection. In summary, this study reassures us that ambient temperature is independently associated with CVD hospital admissions and offers support for a positive association between seasonal influenza activity and cardiovascular events in Hong Kong."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
