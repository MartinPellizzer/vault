Many of the key features of human asthma such as reversible airflow obstruction, pulmonary inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and cough are demonstrated in dogs after provocation with antigen, following a period of hyperventilation with dry air or after inhalation of ozone. Furthermore, standard anti-asthma drugs such as beta-adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids and leukotriene inhibitors are effective in these models. The pathology and pathophysiology of chronic bronchitis and emphysema can also be demonstrated in dogs after exposure to cigarette smoke, following inhalation of sulfur dioxide and by intra-tracheal or aerosol administration of proteolytic enzymes such as papain. These canine models of COPD have been used to evaluate a variety of new methodologies and treatments before they are tested in humans. This review highlights some of the important features of these canine models and how they have increased our understanding of the pathology, pathophysiology and control of human asthma and COPD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Schering-Plough Research Institute, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, NJ 07033-0539, USA. richard.chapman@spcorp.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chapman", "ForeName": "Richard W", "Initials": "RW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pulm Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9715279", "ISSNLinking": "1094-5539"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dog Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}], "NumberOfReferences": "154"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18329932", "10.1016/j.pupt.2008.01.003", "S1094-5539(08)00008-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
