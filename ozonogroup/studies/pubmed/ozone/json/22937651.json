Two treatments were installed, i. e., ambient O3 and 150% of ambient O3, and four winter varieties, i. e., Yannong 19, Yangmai 16, Jiaxin 002, and Yangfumai 2, were taken as the test materials. At anthesis, elevated O3 concentration had a slight damage to the flag leaf microscopic structure. The mesophyll cell and chloroplast structure began destroying, and the grana lamellae started breaking and loosing. Twenty-one days after anthesis, the differences in the leaf microscopic structure between the two treatments became significant. Under elevated O3, the flag leaf senescence was accelerated, with the endomembrane system disintegrated, grana lamella disappeared, and corpus adiposum inside chloroplast broken down, resulting in a significant decrease of the chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate, and grain weight at maturing stage. Significant difference was observed among the test varieties in their responses to elevated O3. Jiaxin 002 was tolerant, while Yangfumai 2 was sensitive to the ozone stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, China. xkzhu@yzu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xin-Kai", "Initials": "XK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Chun-Yan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ru-Biao", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun-Yan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Wen-Shan", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jian-Guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Kazuhiko", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment, Controlled"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22937651"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
