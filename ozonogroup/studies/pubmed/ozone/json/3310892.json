In this study, we investigated the effects of O3 on the biosynthesis of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli to determine their role in the defense against ozone toxicity. Inhibition of growth and loss of viability were observed in cultures exposed to ozone. Results also showed an increase in the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase in cultures exposed to ozone, which was shown to be due to true induction rather than activation of preexisting apoproteins. Cessation of O3 exposure resulted in 30 min of continual high rate of catalase biosynthesis followed by a gradual decrease in the level of the enzyme approaching that of control cultures. This decrease was attributed to a concomitant cessation of de novo enzyme synthesis and dilution of preexisting enzyme by cellular growth. Ozonation of cell-free extracts showed that superoxide dismutase and catalase are subject to oxidative inactivation by ozone. In vivo induction of these enzymes may represent an adaptive response evolved to protect cells against ozone toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27695-7624."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whiteside", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-07046", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3310892", "10.1016/0003-9861(87)90591-1", "0003-9861(87)90591-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
