We evaluated hourly relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of ambulance dispatches in Taiwan to treat respiratory distress, coma and unconsciousness, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), from 2006 to 2015. We considered island-wide ambient temperatures, fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at lag 0-180\u00a0h while using a distributed lag nonlinear model and meta-analysis. Results showed the pooled risks peaked at lag 16-18\u00a0h for all ambulance dispatches at 99th percentile of hourly temperature (32\u00a0\u00b0C, versus reference temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C), with significant excess risk of 0.11% (95% CI; 0.06, 0.17) for coma and unconsciousness, and 0.06% (95% CI; 0.01, 0.11) for OHCA. The risks of exposure to 90th percentile of hourly O<sub>3</sub> of 52.3\u00a0ppb relative to the Q1 level of 17.3\u00a0ppb peaked at lag 14\u00a0h, with excess risk of 0.17% (95% CI; 0.11, 0.23) for respiratory distress, 0.11% (95% CI; 0.06, 0.16) for coma and unconsciousness, and 0.07% (95% CI; 0.01, 0.14) for OHCA. The population exposed to reference temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0\u00b0C, and 26\u00a0\u00b0C were exposed to the lowest levels of ambulance dispatches risk for respiratory distress, coma and unconsciousness, and OHCA, respectively; the highest cumulative 0-96 h RRs of ambulance dispatches were 1.27 (95% CI; 1.19, 1.35) for OHCA at 5th percentile temperatures and 1.25 (95% CI; 1.11, 1.41) for OHCA at 99th percentile temperatures. Following an accumulating lag of 0-96\u00a0h, no significant risk was identified for hourly levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. In conclusion, the analytical results of hourly data speak to immediate and real-time responses to environmental changes, rather than to short-term relationships. In our analyses, we emphasized health events in extreme heat; thus, we recommend a comparative study of daily versus hourly associations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
