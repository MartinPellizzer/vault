The emission amount of air pollutants is considerable here, and O<sub>3</sub> pollution has become serious in recent years. Clarifying the air pollutant emission characteristics and exploring the formation mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> are the basis for objectively understanding the O<sub>3</sub> pollution and formulating scientific prevention and control measures. This study established the high-resolution emission inventory of Wuhai in 2018 (HEI-WH18) based on the \"coefficient method,\" evaluated the applicability and accuracy of HEI-WH18 using the WRF-Chem model, and explored the causes of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in summer using WRF-Chem diagnosis module output. The HEI-WH18 showed that the total emissions amount of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, VOCs, NH<sub>3</sub>, BC, and OC were 65943, 40934, 172867, 159771, 47469, 69191, 1407, 1491, and 1648 t\u00b7a<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. HEI-WH18 could capture the variation and magnitude of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors better than the MEIC, which was suitable for the O<sub>3</sub> simulation and source analysis in summer. From the perspective of spatial distribution, Haibowan was a high-value area of O<sub>3</sub> during the daytime, and the three industrial parks were low-value areas of O<sub>3</sub> and high-value areas of NO<sub>2</sub> during the daytime and nighttime. The spatial distribution characteristics of CO were consistent with the spontaneous combustion of coal and coal gangue sources. According to the diagnostic analysis of two O<sub>3</sub> pollution processes, the O<sub>3</sub> increase in the upper boundary layer was mainly related to the advection transport and chemical process, and it was caused by vertical mixing and the advection transport process in the lower boundary layer. The contribution of the chemical process in the lower boundary layer was complicated, and its positive contribution played a role in maintaining a high O<sub>3</sub> concentration, whereas its negative contribution combined with advection transport resulted in the final dissipation of O<sub>3</sub> pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Xin", "Initials": "RX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhai Ecology and Environment Bureau, Wuhai 016000, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhai Branch of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environmental Monitoring Center Station, Wuhai 016000, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Chun-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhai Branch of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environmental Monitoring Center Station, Wuhai 016000, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Xi-Ping", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guang-Yao", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yu-Fan", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Jia-Qi", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36224119", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202201072"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
