Average individual-level concentrations of air pollution for 5 different exposure windows, vary from 90\u202fdays to 720\u202fdays to diagnosis were estimated using measurements from monitor closest to the patient home addresses. Logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders was employed to evaluate correlation between air pollution and DR-TB risk at different five exposure windows individually.", "There were substantially increased mono-drug resistance and poly-drug resistance risks for ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO exposures. High exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and CO was also significantly associated with increased incidence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) both in the single- and multi-pollutants regression models. The dominant positive associations for PM<sub>2.5</sub>was observed at 540\u202fdays exposure, for O<sub>3</sub> was observed at 180\u202fdays exposure, and for PM<sub>10</sub> and CO was observed from 90\u202fdays to 540\u202fdays exposures.", "Our finding suggest that exposure to ambient air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and CO) are associated with increased risk of DR-TB.
