Due to surface geometry, especially near the corners, this silica-like surface layer has non-uniform thickness, which can impact many mechanical properties, including adhesion and fracture strength. Here we use a simple analytic model based on diffusion of reactive species to predict the thickness of the oxidized surface layer near the corners. We demonstrate that these corner solutions can be patched together to determine the thickness of the oxidized layer in complex geometries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7270-6000"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Field of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. zl544@cornell.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Global Station for Soft Matter, GI-CoRE, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Chung-Yuen", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0779-0880"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Lehigh University, 272 HST Building, Morton Street, Bethlehem, PA 18015, USA."}], "LastName": "Jagota", "ForeName": "Anand", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3187-9025"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Field of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. zl544@cornell.edu."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zezhou", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Soft Matter", "NlmUniqueID": "101295070", "ISSNLinking": "1744-683X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38014719", "10.1039/d3sm01308a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
