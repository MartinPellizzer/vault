The aim of this work was to explore the health effects of occupational exposure to printer emissions on workers, especially cardiovascular and lung function. We sampled particles in the print shop for characterization, including particle size distribution and elemental composition, and measured PM<sub>1</sub> number concentrations in print shops and other workplaces. We assessed blood pressure, heart rate and pulmonary function in 53 printing room workers and 54 controls in Beijing, China. Multiple linear regression analysis were used to examine health effects of exposure to printer emissions. The PM<sub>1</sub> number concentration in the print shop was more than 2 times that of the control group. Compared with controls, the exposed workers with lower education and income had heavier workload with a median of 7\u00a0days per week and 12\u00a0h per day on working days, and presented cardiopulmonary function injury with increased the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The most significant changes of cardiopulmonary function were found in exposed workers with more than 10\u00a0years of working age. Multiple linear regression also showed printer emissions exposure was associated with increased SBP and MAP, while decreased lung function indices. This study found changes in the cardiopulmonary function of staff members exposed to printer emissions, which prompted the necessity and urgency of improving the environment of printing rooms and protecting the health of exposed workers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
