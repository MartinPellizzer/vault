Sterile paper points used to sample bacteria from the canals to tubes containing 5 mL of brain heart infusion broth. Then, 10 mL suspension was incubated in culture media for 24 h. Data were analyzed statistically using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test.", "There were statistically significant differences between all groups (P<0.05).
