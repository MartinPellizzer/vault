In this study, we evaluated the influence of the site of injury on the healing process after complete transverse tear of ACL using a rat model.", "A total of 58 skeletally mature Wistar rats were randomly assigned to various ACL injury groups: controlled abnormal movement-mid-portion (CAM-MP), controlled abnormal movement-femoral side (CAM-FS), ACL transection-mid-portion (ACLT-MP), or ACL transection-femoral side (ACLT-FS) injury groups. The ACL was completely transected in the mid-portion in the ACLT-MP and CAM-MP groups, and on the femoral side in the ACLT-FS and CAM-FS groups. Both CAM groups underwent extra-articular braking to control for abnormal tibial translation. The animals were allowed full cage activity until sacrifice postoperatively for histological and biomechanical assessment.", "Significant differences were found in the ratios of residual ligament lengths between the CAM-MP and CAM-FS groups, demonstrating the validity of each model. Spontaneous healing of the injured ACL was observed in the CAM-MP and CAM-FS groups but not in the ACLT-MP and ACLT-FS groups. The mechanical strength of the healing ACL did not differ between the CAM-MP and CAM-FS groups 8\u00a0weeks after injury; however, the former had better mechanical strength than the latter 12\u00a0weeks after the injury.", "ACL injuries in the mid-portion and on the femoral side may be treated with conservative therapy for spontaneous healing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation, Soka Orthopedics Internal Medicine, Soka, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation, Yatsuka Orthopedics Internal Medicine, Soka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kano", "ForeName": "Takuma", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kokubun", "ForeName": "Takanori", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Murata", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Oka", "ForeName": "Yuichiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Kaichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Arakawa", "ForeName": "Kohei", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Course of Health and Social Services, Graduate School of Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Morishita", "ForeName": "Yuri", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takayanagi", "ForeName": "Kiyomi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health and Social Services, Saitama Prefectural University, Koshigaya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kanemura", "ForeName": "Naohiko", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Connect Tissue Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0365263", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8207"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Anterior Cruciate Ligament"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dyskinesias"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Knee Joint"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Rupture"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "41"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33588658", "10.1080/03008207.2021.1889529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
