Chamber O(3) treatments included charcoal filtered (CF) air, non-filtered (NF) air, NF + 0.03, NF + 0.06 and NF + 0.09 microl litre(-1) O(3). Soil water potentials measured at 25 and 45 cm averaged -0.40 MPa and -0.05 MPa, respectively, for the plots in the water-stressed and well-watered series. Total root length/core, root length densities, and biomasses (dry weights) were determined. With Williams, a very popular cultivar in recent years, total root length for all O(3) treatments averaged 58% more under water-stress conditions than in well-watered plots, but the range was from 136% to 11% more for NF air and NF + 0.09 microl litre(-1) O(3), respectively. Increasing the O(3) exposure dose did not affect root lengths or weights in the well-watered series. With Corsoy, water stress did not significantly increase root development. In both soil moisture regimes, with both cultivars, there was a linear decrease in seed yield and top dry weight as the O(3) exposure dose increased."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Stress Laboratory, Agricultural Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heggestad", "ForeName": "H E", "Initials": "HE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gish", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092641", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90191-1", "0269749188901911"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
