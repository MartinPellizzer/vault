Ozone concentrations in the nearby Central Wasatch Mountains were monitored to determine the potential for vegetation injury. The SUM60 value of 19,000 ppbv-hr in these mountains and peak hourly concentrations >100 ppbv suggests that ozone-sensitive species may be injured. Ozone concentrations in the mountains were greatest during periods of strong upslope winds from the Salt Lake Valley. Both SUM60 values and hourly average concentrations in the Central Wasatch Mountains were strongly correlated with those in the Salt Lake Valley, suggesting that data from valley stations could be used to estimate ozone in the mountains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Wildland Resources and Ecology Center, Utah State University, Logan 84322-5215, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wager", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "Fred A", "Initials": "FA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17063861", "10.1080/10473289.2006.10465921"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
