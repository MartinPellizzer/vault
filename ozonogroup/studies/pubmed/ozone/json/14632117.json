These can be routinely used for ambient monitoring in a fully automated manner. We consider both stopped and continuous flow operations and show the superiority of the stopped flow mode theoretically and experimentally. Light throughput through various membrane tubes is presented, and superior performance of such tubes over Teflon AF is shown. Sensors for NO2 and for O3 were based on Griess-Saltzman and indigotrisulfonate chemistries, respectively. A computer-controlled two-LED absorbance measurement system (one wavelength monitors the signal, the other references the system) that also governs automated reagent refilling was implemented. Sub-parts-per-billion-volume detection limits are attainable within a few minutes for both gases. Comparative data with a commercial UV-photometry-based ozone monitor showed excellent agreement with the response pattern of the present instrument. Low cost, ready applicability to the measurement of different gases by merely changing the light source and chemistry, and high sensitivity makes this instrument attractive for both pedagogic and practical purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Faculty of Science, Kumamoto University, 2-39-1, Kurokami, Kumamoto 860-8555, Japan. todakei@sci.kumamoto-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toda", "ForeName": "Kei", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshioka", "ForeName": "Ken-Ichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohira", "ForeName": "Shin-Ichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jianzhong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dasgupta", "ForeName": "Purnendu K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14632117", "10.1021/ac0341719"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
