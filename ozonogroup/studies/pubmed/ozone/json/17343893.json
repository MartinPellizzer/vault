In addition, the active microbial biomass established on GAC is responsible for the removal of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon compounds present in water or formed during oxidation (e.g., ozonation and chlorination) processes. In order to conduct correct kinetic evaluations of DOC removal during drinking water treatment, and to assess the state and performance of full-scale GAC filter installations, an accurate and sensitive method for active biomass determination on GAC is required. We have developed a straight-forward method based on direct measurement of the total adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) content of a GAC sample and other support media. In this method, we have combined flow-cytometric absolute cell counting and ATP analysis to derive case-specific ATP/cell conversion values. In this study, we present the detailed standardisation of the ATP method. An uncertainty assessment has shown that heterogeneous colonisation of the GAC particles makes the largest contribution to the combined standard uncertainty of the method. The method was applied for the investigation of biofilm formation during the start-up period of a GAC pilot-scale plant treating Lake Zurich water. A rapid increase in the biomass of up to 1.1 x 10(10)cells/g GAC dry weight (DW) within the first 33 days was observed, followed by a slight decrease to an average steady-state concentration of 7.9 x 10(9)cells/g GAC DW. It was shown that the method can be used to determine the biomass attached to the GAC for both stable and developing biofilms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), P.O.
