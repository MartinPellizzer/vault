Local symptoms of Candida infections in the knee are atypical, rarely associated with systemic symptoms, and difficult to distinguish from other types of knee arthritis. We here report a special case of C. parapsilosis infections in the knee joint. A patient had previously undergone knee puncture in a private clinic for the treatment of osteoarthritis and developed a left knee joint infection with C. parapsilosis. However, the patient only showed more severe local knee symptoms, and there was no systemic manifestation associated with any Candida infection. Surprisingly, after receiving ozone lavage, the patient showed symptoms of a systemic infection such as fever and chills. There was no positive finding in the blood cultures. Finally, the synovial fluid cultures showed a C. parapsilosis infections. After antifungal treatment and another knee ozone therapy, the patient did not experience recurrence of the infections. It is suggested that in this special case, the strong sterilization with ozone caused the destruction of C. parapsilosis, leading to a transient systemic toxin reaction. In addition, we reviewed the 17 cases of C. parapsilosis infections that have been reported thus far."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pain Department, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, No. 25 Pacific Street, Luzhou, 646000, China."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Guo", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pain Department, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, No. 25 Pacific Street, Luzhou, 646000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hongmei", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pain Department, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, No. 25 Pacific Street, Luzhou, 646000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Milian", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pain Department, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, No. 25 Pacific Street, Luzhou, 646000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiangbo", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0249-7375"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pain Department, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, No. 25 Pacific Street, Luzhou, 646000, China. oucehua@swmu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Cehua", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mycopathologia", "NlmUniqueID": "7505689", "ISSNLinking": "0301-486X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Candida parapsilosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Candidiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drainage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Knee Joint"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutic Irrigation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32318935", "10.1007/s11046-020-00447-8", "10.1007/s11046-020-00447-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
