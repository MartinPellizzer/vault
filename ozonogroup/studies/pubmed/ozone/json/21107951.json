Nowadays, hardly anyone questions its effectiveness.We treated 270 patients with discal hernia of one or multiple levels in a minimally invasive way and under fluoroscopic control in real time, between 1 and 7 ml intradiscal and 3 ml periganglionic, in a concentration of 30 mg/ml of a mixture of oxygen and ozone as the one and only drug.A second group was created, out of which 120 patients were treated with physiatric and kinetic treatment (magnetotherapy) prior to any other type of treatment, whether surgical or minimally invasive.The time period was 3 months. All the patients were followed up from April 2004 to July 2008 with the MacNab, VAS and Owestry scales. We obtained 86% of excellent results, 12% satisfactory results, and 2% poor results.To sum up, we can say that ozone therapy has opened up a new future in the medical field.Discussions go on. New effects, new concentrations and the combination with bioenergetic therapies are the future in the treatment for backaches."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Central de Medicina, 43 n 581 (1900), La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. oapepa@yahoo.com.ar"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alberto", "ForeName": "Pepa Osvaldo", "Initials": "PO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Acta Neurochir Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "100962752", "ISSNLinking": "0065-1419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Spinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21107951", "10.1007/978-3-211-99370-5_22"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
