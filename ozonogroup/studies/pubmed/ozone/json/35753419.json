Herein, the effects of vacuum ultraviolet/ozone (VUV/O<sub>3</sub>) pretreatment on alleviating ultrafiltration membrane fouling caused by AOM, including extracellular organic matter (EOM) and intracellular organic matter (IOM), were investigated systematically. Compared to its sub-processes (UV/O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, VUV, and UV), VUV/O<sub>3</sub> pretreatment showed the best performance on AOM removal and membrane fouling mitigation. After VUV/O<sub>3</sub> pretreatment, the DOC of EOM and IOM in feed decreased by 51.1% and 26.7%, respectively, and fluorescence components and UV<sub>254</sub> of EOM and IOM in feed decreased obviously. Hence, the final specific fluxes of the membranes increased significantly under the impacts of VUV/O<sub>3</sub>, and VUV/O<sub>3</sub> achieved 89.5% and 97.2% mitigation of reversible fouling caused by EOM and IOM, respectively. VUV/O<sub>3</sub> pretreatment also reduced the foulants on membrane surface and surface roughness. Moreover, under the effects of reactive oxygen species oxidation, VUV photolysis, and direct O<sub>3</sub> oxidation, VUV/O<sub>3</sub> decreased organic load and changed the molecular weight distribution, hydrophilicity, and interaction-free energy of AOM, thus mitigating membrane fouling. Furthermore, the effects of O<sub>3</sub> dosage and molecular weight cut-off of ultrafiltration membrane on membrane fouling mitigation by VUV/O<sub>3</sub> were also investigated. All results highlighted that VUV/O<sub>3</sub> pretreatment had huge potential in mitigating AOM-induced membrane fouling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
