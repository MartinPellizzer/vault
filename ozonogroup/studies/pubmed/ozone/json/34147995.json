PTFE-C/PTFE electrode was used to enhance H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in-situ electro-generation and the electro-peroxone process (EPP) treatment of leachate. Various analytical methods results were applied to prove that the PTFE-C/PTFE electrode greatly improved the performance of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation and electrode stability. The effects of initial pH, current intensity, ozone flow and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration on the removal of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from landfill leachate were studied in the EPP with PTFE-C/PTFE as cathode (MEPP) by one factor at a time (OFAT) method. The initial pH value 7.5, current intensity 300\u00a0mA, ozone flow 875\u00a0mg/h and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration value 4198\u00a0mg/L were selected as the best operating parameters. A response surface methodology based on box-behnken design (BBD) was employed to optimize running conditions of the MEPP of leachate. After optimization, Mineralization efficiency of the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and COD was obtained to be 79.83% and 52.14%, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>)/COD ratio increased to 0.38 after 4\u00a0h. The removal curves of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and COD in the MEPP conforms to the zero-order and first-order reaction kinetics, respectively. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) analysis shows that MEPP has a good removal effect on organics in leachate. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were carried out for the cathode sediment, which was mainly magnesium ion silicate precipitation and NaCl."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
