(2) Main effects were observed in the mesophyll; the vascular strand showed minor cellular changes. (3) Needle shape and ratio of intercellular area to cross section was clone- age-dependent, with a clear increase in intercellular space associated with the treatment (clone 14 and 11 only). (4) Accumulation of tannins in vacuoles was clone-specific. (5) Strong starch formation was found in all samples; in clones 14 and 133 this formation was enhanced by the treatment in older needles, if number of starch grains per cell was calculated. (6) The accumulation of plastoglobules in plastids depended on clone and age, with the older needles containing more globules. In clones 11 and 133, the treatment led to an increase in the number of plastoglobules. (7) Grana stacking in all clones and both needle ages subjected to ozone and acid mist was significantly reduced. The observed changes in the ultrastructure of needle tissue are comparable to those found in field investigations with similar conditions, or phytotron studies evaluating pollution effects on spruce trees."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Zellmorphologie, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t, 4630 Bochum, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ebel", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenkranz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schiffgens", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fctz", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092288", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90054-g", "0269-7491(90)90054-G"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
