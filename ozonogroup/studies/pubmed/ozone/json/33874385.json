Norland) following exposure to charcoal-filtered air or 0.30\u03bcl l<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> for 6 h. Rubisco small subunit (rbcS) mRNA levels declined dramatically in control foliage within 10.16 h of dark incubation; thus declines in Rubisco protein following a 48-h dark period were ascribed to proteolytic degradation. Foliage sampled from the 4th and 6th leaves from the apex, designated immature and mature, respectively, showed no effect of O<sub>3</sub> on Rubisco protein content immediately following the exposure. However, the decline in Rubisco quantity during the dark incubation was significantly enhanced by prior treatment with O<sub>3</sub> in the mature leaves. The immature leaves sustained a similar decline in Rubisco quantity in both O<sub>2</sub> and control treatments. O<sub>3</sub> had a significant effect on the relative quantity of rbcS mRNA in the immature leaves (sampled immediately following the O<sub>3</sub> exposure). Levels of rbcS mRNA in mature leaves and Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) mRNA in both leaf ages were not significantly affected by O<sub>3</sub> , There was no effect of O<sub>3</sub> , on Rubisco quantity in immature or mature leave's of plants maintained in the greenhouse under a 16 h photoperiod far 48 h following the exposure. Thus the effect of short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure on processes affecting Rubisco synthesis and degradation may have been transient, and a more prolonged exposure would he necessary to effect a decline in Rubisco protein quantity in plants grown under a 16 h photoperiod. We concluded that O<sub>3</sub> caused enhanced degradation of Rubisco in mature leaves of plants induced to senesce by dark incubation following O<sub>3</sub> exposures. The potential for O<sub>3</sub> -induced reduction in synthesis of Rubisco also exists."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Plant Physiology, and Department of Plant Pathology and The Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, 211 Buckhout Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eckardt", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Plant Physiology, and Department of Plant Pathology and The Environmental Resources Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, 211 Buckhout Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abott MS, Bogorad, L. 1986.
