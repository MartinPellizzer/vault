Ultrashort lifetimes are a general property of absorbing sunscreen molecules, suggesting that the nucleobases are molecular survivors of a harsh UV environment. Encoding the genome using photostable building blocks is an elegant solution to the threat of photochemical damage. Ultrafast excited-state deactivation strongly supports the hypothesis that UV radiation played a major role in shaping molecular inventories on the early Earth before the emergence of life and the subsequent development of a protective ozone shield. Here, we review the general physical and chemical principles that underlie the photostability, or \"UV hardiness\", of modern nucleic acids and discuss the possible implications of these findings for prebiotic chemical evolution. In RNA and DNA strands, much longer-lived excited states are observed, which at first glance appear to increase the risk of photochemistry. It is proposed that the dramatically different photoproperties that emerge from assemblies of photostable building blocks may explain the transition from a world of molecular survival to a world in which energy-rich excited electronic states were eventually tamed for biological purposes such as energy transduction, signaling, and repair of the genetic machinery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana 59717-3400, USA. bkohler@montana.edu."}], "LastName": "Beckstead", "ForeName": "Ashley A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Vries", "ForeName": "Mattanjah S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kohler", "ForeName": "Bern", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleotides"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27539809", "10.1039/c6cp04230a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
