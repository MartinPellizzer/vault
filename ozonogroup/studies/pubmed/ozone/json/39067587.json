A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method for the retrieval of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> vertical distribution from ground-based Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements to tackle the issue of stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> absorption interference faced by MAX-DOAS in obtaining tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> profiles. Firstly, a hybrid model, named PCA-F_Regression-SVR, is developed to screen features sensitive to O<sub>3</sub> inversion based on the MAX-DOAS spectra and EAC4 reanalysis O<sub>3</sub> profiles, which incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), F_Regression function, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. Thus, these screened features for ancillary inversion include the profiles of temperature, specific humidity, fraction of cloud coverage, eastward and northward wind, the profiles of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and HCHO, as well as season and time features to serve as sensitive factors. Secondly, the preprocessed MAX-DOAS spectra dataset and the sensitive factor dataset are utilized as input, while the O<sub>3</sub> profiles of the EAC4 reanalysis dataset incorporating the surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are employed as output for constructing the CNN model. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) decreases from 26\u202f% to approximately 19\u202f%. Finally, the CNN model is applied for inversion and comparison of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> profiles using independent input data. The CNN model effectively reproduces the O<sub>3</sub> profiles of the EAC4 dataset, showing a Gaussian-like spatial distribution with peaks primarily around 950\u202fhPa (550\u202fm). Since the reanalysis data used for model training has been smoothed, the CNN model is insensitive to extreme values. This behavior can be attributed to the MAPE loss function, which evaluates Absolute Percentage Errors (APEs) of O\u2083 concentration at all altitudes, resulting in varying retrieval accuracy across different altitudes while maintaining overall MAPE control. Temporally, the CNN model tends to overestimate surface O<sub>3</sub> in summer by around 20\u202f\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, primarily due to the influence of the temperature feature in the sensitivity factor dataset. In conclusion, leveraging MAX-DOAS spectra enables the retrieval of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> vertical distribution through the established CNN model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
