The smallest areas (<1% area of the SO) are affected by glacier retreat and warming in the deeper euphotic layer. In the future, decrease in the sea-ice is expected to be widespread. Changes in iceberg impact resulting from further collapse of ice-shelves can potentially affect large parts of shelf and ephemerally in the off-shore regions. However, aragonite undersaturation (acidification) might become one of the biggest problems for the Antarctic marine ecosystem by affecting almost the entire SO. Direct and indirect impacts of various environmental changes to the three major habitats, sea-ice, pelagic and benthos and their biota are complex. The areas affected by environmental stressors range from 33% of the SO for a single stressor, 11% for two and 2% for three, to <1% for four and five overlapping factors. In the future, areas expected to be affected by 2 and 3 overlapping factors are equally large, including potential iceberg changes, and together cover almost 86% of the SO ecosystem."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Am Alten Hafen 26, Bremerhaven, D - 27568, Germany."}], "LastName": "Gutt", "ForeName": "Julian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertler", "ForeName": "Nancy", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bracegirdle", "ForeName": "Thomas J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buschmann", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Comiso", "ForeName": "Josefino", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hosie", "ForeName": "Graham", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Isla", "ForeName": "Enrique", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schloss", "ForeName": "Irene R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Craig R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tournadre", "ForeName": "Jean", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xavier", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Glob Chang Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9888746", "ISSNLinking": "1354-1013"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antarctic Regions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ice Cover"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oceans and Seas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25369312", "10.1111/gcb.12794"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
