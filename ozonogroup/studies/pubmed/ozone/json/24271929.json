A further objective was to establish whether the response of increased levels of glucose, sucrose, starch and G6P in leaves could be correlated with a greater degree of plant tolerance to O3. Four commercially available Spinacia oleracea varieties were screened for tolerance or susceptibility to detrimental effects of O3 employing one 6.5 hour acute exposure to 25O nL O3 L(-1) air during the light. One day after the termination of ozonation (29 d post emergence), leaves of the plants were monitored both for damage and for gas exchange characteristics. Cultivar Winter Bloomsdale (cv Winter) leaves were least damaged on a quantitative grading scale. The leaves of cv Nordic, the most susceptible, were approximately 2.5 times more damaged. Photosynthesis (Pn) rates in the ozonated mature leaves of cv Winter were 48.9% less, and in cv Nordic, 66.2% less than in comparable leaves of their non-ozonated controls. Stomatal conductance of leaves of ozonated plants was found not to be a factor in the lower Pn rates in the ozonated plants. At some time points in the light, leaves of ozonated cv Winter plants had significantly higher levels of glucose, sucrose, starch, G6P, G1P, pyruvate and malate than did leaves of ozonated cv Nordic plants. It was concluded that leaves of cv Winter displayed a higher tolerance to ozone mediated stress than those of cv Nordic, in part because they had higher levels of glucose and G6P that could be mobilized during diminished photosynthesis to generate antioxidants (e.g., ascorbate) and reductants (e.g., NADPH). Elevated levels of both pyruvate and malate in the leaves of ozonated cv Winter suggested an increased availability of respiratory substrates to support higher respiratory capacity needed for repair, growth, and maintenance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Research Service, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center-West, Climate Stress Laboratory, Natural Resources Institute, USDA, Building 046A, 20705-2350, Beltsville, MD, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rowland", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Photosynth Res", "NlmUniqueID": "100954728", "ISSNLinking": "0166-8595"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1976 Aug;58(2):135-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16659633"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1985 Dec 17;133(2):773-9", "ArticleIdList": ["4084297"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Jan;92(1):29-36", "ArticleIdList": ["16667261"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1993 Mar;101(3):969-976", "ArticleIdList": ["12231749"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1994 Mar;39(3):439-51", "ArticleIdList": ["24311135"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Sep;94(1):259-67", "ArticleIdList": ["16667695"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1990;64(3-4):323-35", "ArticleIdList": ["15092288"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Aug;72(4):1016-20", "ArticleIdList": ["16663113"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1976 Sep;75(1):201-10", "ArticleIdList": ["962128"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1985 Nov;79(3):684-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16664473"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1980 Nov;66(5):815-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16661532"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Jan;89(1):225-30", "ArticleIdList": ["16666518"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Jul;99(3):1105-17", "ArticleIdList": ["16668977"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1984 Jun;75(2):397-409", "ArticleIdList": ["16663634"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Chim Acta. 1966 Sep;14(3):361-6", "ArticleIdList": ["5970965"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1995 Apr;107(4):1049-1054", "ArticleIdList": ["12228418"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1974 Jun;53(6):835-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16658800"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1995 Sep;109(1):203-12", "ArticleIdList": ["7480322"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1979 Jan;145(4):377-82", "ArticleIdList": ["24317766"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Jun;96(2):650-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16668235"]}, {"Citation": "Photosynth Res. 1994 Mar;39(3):453-62", "ArticleIdList": ["24311136"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 Oct;91(2):679-84", "ArticleIdList": ["16667087"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1995 Oct;109(2):421-432", "ArticleIdList": ["12228603"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24271929", "10.1007/BF00014882"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
