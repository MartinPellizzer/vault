The removal efficiencies of oxalic acid by Pt/graphite, graphite catalyzed ozonation and ozonation alone were compared. It was found that the removal efficiency of oxalic acid in ozonation alone, graphite and Pt/graphite catalyzed ozonation was 3.0%, 47.6% and 99.3% respectively under the present experimental conditions. Results showed that loading of Pt could significantly increase the catalytic activity of graphite. Taking oxalic acid degradation efficiency as indication, the preparation conditions of Pt/graphite were optimized. The pretreatment of graphite had no favor to improve the activity of Pt/graphite catalyst. The optimal preparation conditions of Pt/graphite catalyst are as follow: impregnant, distilled water; impregnation time, 24 h; the loading amount of Pt, 1.0%; reduction temperature, 35 degrees C. The Pt/graphite catalyst was used for five times with no significant decrease of its activity and more than 90% oxalic acid removal was obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zhqliu1226@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng-Qian", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49DFR088MY", "NameOfSubstance": "Platinum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7782-42-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Graphite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9E7R5L6H31", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxalic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Graphite"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxalic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Platinum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17674732"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
