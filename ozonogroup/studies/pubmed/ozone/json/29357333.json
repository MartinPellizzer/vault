An abundance of medical and surgical interventions have evolved to resolve this problem, but one of the newly introduced techniques, which is the minimally invasive, low cost ozone-oxygen mixture (O\u2083-O\u2082) intradiscal injection, offers a rapid onset amelioration of symptoms with a sustained duration of pain relief.", "We aim to evaluate the quality of pain alleviation using 2 different doses of intradiscal injections of O\u2083-O\u2082 mixture.", "A prospectively randomized, single-blind study.", "Pain clinic, anesthesia, intensive care, and pain department in Assiut University Hospitals.", "Sixty patients with symptomatizing single lumbar DH were subjected to O\u2083-O\u2082 intradiscal injection and randomly allocated into one of 2 groups; group A: received 10 mL, 40 \u00b5g/mL of O\u2083-O\u2082 and group B: received 10 mL, 30 \u00b5g/mL of O\u2083-O\u2082. Pain score and functional ability of the patients using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were evaluated after 1, 6, and 12 months and compared to the basal values. Patient satisfaction and reduction of DH were evaluated after the sixth month.", "There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding the clinical outcome; however both the ODI and VAS evaluations showed highly significant improvement (decreased) (P < 0.01) after injection and during the entire follow-up period. There were highly significant negative correlations between the DH reduction percentage and both the VAS and ODI scores after 6 months in both of the groups.", "This study was limited by a small sample size; it was also an active control trial, which may explain the insignificant difference in between the groups, in addition to being a single-blind trial.", "Intradiscal injection of O\u2083-O\u2082 mixture is a very valuable maneuver in the reduction of DH size and improvement of pain quality, with either ozone concentrations of 40 \u00b5g/mL or 30 \u00b5g/mL.", "Low back pain, ozone, disc herniation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elawamy", "ForeName": "Abdelraheem", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamel", "ForeName": "Emad Zarief", "Initials": "EZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassanien", "ForeName": "Manal", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wahba", "ForeName": "Ola M", "Initials": "OM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amin", "ForeName": "Shereen Ezzat", "Initials": "SE"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "AccessionNumberList": ["NCT03023969"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pain Physician", "NlmUniqueID": "100954394", "ISSNLinking": "1533-3159"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Intervertebral disc disease"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Spinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Management"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Visual Analog Scale"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29357333"]}}]}
