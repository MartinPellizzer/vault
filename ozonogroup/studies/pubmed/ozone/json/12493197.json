The purpose of the short-term CLs is to ensure protection of all crops to acute ozone injury. The currently used CLs are based on the ozone exposure of the plants during daylight hours expressed as AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over the Threshold 40 nmol mol(-1) ozone). The aims of this study were: to test the performance of the current short-term CLs, to test alternative ozone exposure indices and to test if changes in the ozone cut-off concentration, the inclusion of a lag-period (LP) between exposure and identification of visible ozone injury or the duration of the ozone integration period improved the performance of the exposure index. The analysis was based on 38 different datasets from experiments with subterranean clover, Trifolium subterraneum in southern Sweden. AOT indices generally performed better than averaged ozone concentrations or SUM (Sum of ozone concentrations when a threshold is exceeded) indices. Regression analysis showed that the current short-term CL, AOT40 with a VPD (water vapour pressure deficit) threshold of 1.5 kPa, explained 56% of the variation in visible injury. A longer exposure period and the introduction of a LP, admitting visible ozone injury time to develop after exposure, improved the performance of the exposure index. AOT30 accumulated over 10 days before harvest, excluding a LP of 3 days before injury observation, performed best and explained 88% of the variation in visible injury. AOT40 indices left a rather large amount of visible injury unexplained indicating that a lower cut-off concentration for ozone is preferable. The results of the investigation indicated that a visible injury threshold of 10% improved the distinction between harmful and less harmful exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Science and Conservation, G\u00f6teborg University, PO Box 464, S-405 30 Goteborg, Sweden. gunilla.pihl.karlsson@miljo.gu.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karlsson", "ForeName": "Gunilla Pihl", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karlsson", "ForeName": "Per Erik", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Danielsson", "ForeName": "Helena", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pleijel", "ForeName": "H\u00e5kan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sweden"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Trifolium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12493197", "10.1016/s0048-9697(02)00391-1", "S0048-9697(02)00391-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
