Moreover, the catalytic ozonation can be enhanced by radiation. The main disadvantage of this technology is the use of a suspended catalyst entailing a separation step. Thus, catalytic ozonation was analysed using supported TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes prepared by anodization at different voltages. The effect of different radiation sources on the catalytic ozonation of parabens was tested. The increase on voltage preparation led to plates with higher surface areas from 60 to 280\u00a0cm<sup>2</sup>. However, this did not improve the parabens mixture degradation during UVA photocatalytic ozonation. The use of sunlight radiation allows a significant reduction in terms of time necessary for total parabens degradation from 15 to 10\u00a0min. However, the amount of ozone required doubles. Catalytic ozonation presents worst results than single ozonation. This means that molecular ozone is the main responsible for degradation. No dissolved ozone was detected at the experiments with supported nanotubes which could mean that it was adsorbed on the catalysts surface decreasing the degradation rates. The presence of municipal wastewaters as matrix inhibited parabens degradation for both single and catalytic ozonation, mainly due to the trapping ozone effect. In fact, for the TOD of 4.5\u00a0mg/L it was just possible to remove about 80% of parabens when MWW compared to 100% when UP was used. Even so, the presence of supported nanotubes during ozonation seems to be required to reduce the toxicity of the resultant treated effluent. In fact, the wastewater luminescence inhibition decreased (from 100 to 43%) and germination index increased (from 7 to 97%) with catalytic ozonation which may enable treated water reuse."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
