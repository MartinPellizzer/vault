One of them is two-phase ozonation, sometimes called as ozone-loaded system. In this study, the solubility and stability of ozone in Fluorinet FC40 as well as the influence of pH and contact time on diffusion rate of oxidant from saturated FC40 phase to water was examined. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the removal efficiency of organic compounds with different distribution coefficient (K(D)) in conventional and ozone-loaded systems as well as to reveal the mechanism of the process. It is shown that organic micropollutants with high K(D) diffuse into FC40 where degradation reaction takes place. In a case of compounds with high polarity the perfluorinated phase works as ozone reservoir. The results indicated that oxidant is gradually released from FC40 into the water. In consequence, the oxidation reaction occurs in water, not in perfluorinated phase as it has been so far presumed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Treatment Technology, Adam Mickiewicz University, Drzyma\u0142y 24, 60-613 Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gromadzka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Swietlik", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbon Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "fluorocarbon 77"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2286E5R2KE", "NameOfSubstance": "Dibutyl Phthalate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IC7888DF4L", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorobenzoic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JE42381TNV", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfamethoxazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dibutyl Phthalate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbon Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfamethoxazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17459452", "10.1016/j.watres.2007.02.008", "S0043-1354(07)00106-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
