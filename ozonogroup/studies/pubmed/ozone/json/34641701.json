The daily values of air pollutants (PM10, SO2, NO2, NOx, CO, and O3) from 2013 until 2018, were obtained. Adjusted Quasi-Poisson regression models including distributed lags, controlled for climate variables were used for data analysis. Increases in SO2, ozone, PMs, and nitrogen oxides were associated with pneumonia hospitalizations, increases in SO2 NOx and PMs were associated with asthma hospitalizations, and increases in SO2 and ozone were associated with bronchitis hospitalizations. Male hospitalization was related with SO2, ozone, and NOx; while female hospitalization was only related with SO2. This study showed that short-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, asthma, and bronchitis hospitalization among children in Bursa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9247-9594"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing, Bursa Uludag University Institute of Health Sciences, Bursa, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00dcnal", "ForeName": "Eda", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0815-9505"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Nursing, Bursa Uludag University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Bursa, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zdemir", "ForeName": "Aysel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7235-9253"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Engineering Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khanjani", "ForeName": "Narges", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5268-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Air Pollution and Respiratory Diseases Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastoorpoor", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0297-846X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Bursa Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zkaya", "ForeName": "G\u00fcven", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pneumonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34641701", "10.1080/09603123.2021.1991282"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
