The UV part of solar radiation, in particular, is linked to disorders ranging from mild inflammatory effects of the skin to as serious as causing several different types of cancers. Changes in lifestyle together with depletion in the atmospheric ozone layer during the last few decades have led to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Skin cancers consisting of basal and squamous cell carcinomas are especially linked to the UVB part of solar radiation. Reducing excessive exposure to solar radiation is desirable; however, as this approach is unavoidable, it is suggested that other novel strategies be developed to reduce the effects of solar radiation to skin. One approach to reduce the harmful effects of solar radiation is through the use of phytochemicals, an approach that is popularly known as \"Photochemoprotection.\" In recent years many phytochemicals with potential antioxidant properties have been identified and found to be photoprotective in nature. We describe here some of the most popular phytochemicals being studied that have the potential to reduce the harmful effects associated with solar UV radiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adhami", "ForeName": "Vaqar M", "Initials": "VM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Syed", "ForeName": "Deeba N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Naghma", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Afaq", "ForeName": "Farrukh", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R21 AT002429-01", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}], "NumberOfReferences": "107"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18266816", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.2007.00293.x", "PHP293"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
