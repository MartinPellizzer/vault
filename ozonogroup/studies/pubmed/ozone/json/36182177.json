Continuous measurements of atmospheric VOCs were conducted from January to February in Hangzhou in 2021. The average measured concentration of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 38.2 \u00b1 20.9 ppb, > 42% lower than that reported by previous studies at the urban center in Hangzhou. The VOC concentrations and proportions were similar between weekdays and weekends. During the long holidays of the Spring Festival in China, the concentrations of TVOCs were \u223c50% lower than those during the regular days, but their profiles showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Further, we deduced that aromatics and alkenes were the most crucial chemicals promoting the formation of O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in Hangzhou. According to interspecies correlations, combustion processes and solvent use were inferred as major VOC emission sources. This study provides implications for air quality improvements before and during the upcoming Asian Games that will be hosted in Hangzhou in 2022."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
