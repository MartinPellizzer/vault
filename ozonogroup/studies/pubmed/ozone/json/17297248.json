Using a passive ozone sampler, we investigated the effects of on-site ozone concentrations on the pulmonary function and symptoms of asthmatics. Twenty moderate to severe asthmatics who had been managed for at least 2 months without changes of their medication were enrolled from 3 June to 18 July 2005. Respiratory, nasal and ocular symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF), which was measured twice a day, and medication use were recorded on a daily basis during the study period. Data for 17 subjects were analyzed. The average ozone exposure level was 28.2+/-23.6 ppb (3.4-315.3 ppb). There was no significant correlation between PEF and ozone concentration (p>0.05) on the same day or 1-, 2-, or 3-day lags. Interestingly, the degree of asthma symptoms was influenced by the ozone concentration (rho=0.303, p<0.001), even at concentrations less than 80 ppb (p=0.298, p<0.001), but the correlation between ozone exposure and the frequency of reliever medication use was not statistically significant (p=0.99). Our results suggest that exposure to relatively low concentrations of ozone influences the symptoms of moderate to severe asthmatics regardless of changes in pulmonary function or medication use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Doh Hyung", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Youn Seup", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jae Seuk", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Ho Jang", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kye Young", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang-Rok", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jee", "ForeName": "Young Koo", "Initials": "YK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Korean Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8703518", "ISSNLinking": "1011-8934"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Burney P.
