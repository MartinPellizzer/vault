However, the effects of ozone and heterogeneous Fenton oxidation on microbial community composition, in particular opportunistic pathogens (OPs), and their metabolic potential in biofilms and effluents from GAC filtration are not fully understood. The results of our pilot-scale test indicated that Fenton-GAC filtration removed more dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 1.25\u00a0mg/L) than ozone-GAC filtration (0.98\u00a0mg/L). Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) results showed that Fenton-GAC removed more tyrosine-like proteins and fulvic acid-like materials, while ozone-GAC removed more humic acid-like compounds and tryptophan-like proteins. Illumina HiSeq analysis indicated that Curvibacter and Hydrogenophaga dominated in the Fenton-GAC biofilm, while Bradyrhizobium, Aquabacterium and Limnobacter were predominant in the ozone-GAC biofilm. Functional prediction suggested that the microbial functional gene related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (the pathway for carbohydrate metabolism) was higher in the Fenton-GAC biofilm, resulting in higher contents of protein in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the Fenton-GAC biofilm. Therefore, there were fewer bacteria that detached from the biofilm into the water during the Fenton-GAC filtration process. The lower EPS content in the effluents from Fenton-GAC resulted in bacteria, including OPs, being easier to remove by chlorine. However, ozone oxidation removed more bacteria, including different OPs, than Fenton oxidation, which contributed to fewer bacteria and OPs in the effluents from ozone-GAC. Overall, our results provide a Fenton-GAC treatment process to remove DOC and control OPs in drinking water systems, the cost of which was comparable to that of ozone-GAC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
