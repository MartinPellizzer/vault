Previous studies have recognized interactions between and among system components while assessing the vulnerability to climate change, but have left open the question of indicator directional interactions. The question is important, not least because indicator directional association analysis provides guidance to address climate risks by revealing the key nodes and pathways. The purpose of this work was to assess health vulnerability to short-term summer heat exposure based on a directional interaction network. Bayesian network model and network analysis were used to conduct a directional interaction network. Using indicator directional associations as weights, a weighted technique for the order of preference by similarity to ideal solution method was then proposed to assess heat-related health vulnerability. Finally, hotspots and coping strategies were explored based on the directional interaction network and health vulnerability assessments. The results showed that (1) indicator directional interactions were revealed in the health vulnerability framework, and the interactions differed between northern and southern China; (2) there was a dramatic spatial imbalance of health vulnerability in China, with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and the Yangtze River Basin identified as hotspots; (3) particulate matter and ozone were recognized as priority indicators in the most vulnerable cities of northern China, while summer heat exposure level and variation were priority indicators in southern China; and (4) adaptive capacity could alter the extent of risk; thus, mitigation and adaptation should be implemented in an integrated way. Our study has important implications for strengthening the theoretical basis for the vulnerability assessment framework by providing indicator directional associations and for guiding policy design in dealing with heat-related health vulnerability in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
