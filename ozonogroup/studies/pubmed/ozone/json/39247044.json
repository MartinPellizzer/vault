Understanding the anatomy, the impact of restorative materials, and their interaction with the periodontium is essential for successful treatment outcomes. Crown lengthening is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of gingiva and bone tissue to expose more of the tooth structure, thereby increasing the visible portion of the tooth (clinical crown height). To protect the wound from mechanical trauma and stability of the surgical site during the healing process, periodontal dressing can be applied after surgery. Ozone therapy has demonstrated its effectiveness in promoting the healing of various types of wounds, including chronic and difficult-to-heal wounds, as an antibacterial agent and in modulating the immune system. Thus, this study aimed to compare, evaluate, and assess the use of periodontal dressing with that of ozonated olive oil after the crown lengthening procedure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Kotecha et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Sharad Pawar Dental College, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Kotecha", "ForeName": "Sakshi V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Sharad Pawar Dental College, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Jaiswal", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dentistry, Sharad Pawar Dental College, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Bhagat", "ForeName": "Shweta", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
