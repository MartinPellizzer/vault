The activity was detected in the Ames test after concentrating the organic mutagens with a XAD-4/8 procedure. Dose-related responses were observed with concentrates corresponding to 0.5 to 3.0 liters of drinking water. A study of the changes in mutagenic activity during the preparation of drinking water in a few waterworks showed that breakpoint chlorination, transport chlorination and post chlorination increased the mutagenic activity, while ozonation only reduced the activity with metabolic activation. When adsorption on activated carbon powder was used, a certain reduction of mutagenic activity was observed. The use of activated carbon filters, however, removed the activity completely. The majority of organic mutagens present in drinking water concentrates were shown to be nonvolatile and relatively stable and probably consist of compounds with a molecular weight in the order of 200. These mutagens are not identical to the organics identified up till now in drinking water by standard gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Finally, a group of organic mutagens, which adsorbs only at pH 2-3 on XAD-4/8 (acid fraction), could be demonstrated in Ames-positive drinking waters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kool", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Kreijl", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Greef", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Kranen", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mutat Res. 1975 Dec;31(6):347-64", "ArticleIdList": ["768755"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1980 Jan 4;207(4426):90-2", "ArticleIdList": ["6985746"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1982 Dec;46:215-27", "ArticleIdList": ["7151763"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6759109", "PMC1569046", "10.1289/ehp.8246207"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
