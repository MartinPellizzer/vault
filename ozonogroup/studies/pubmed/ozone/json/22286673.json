AMO3 was prepared through a new original process that modifies the oil before ozonation by alcoholic catalytic esterification. Susceptibility was studied in 41 dermatophytes by agar diffusion and broth microdilution tests. The experimental model to assess the topical safety of the oil included 60 CF1 mice divided in three groups that were treated with vaseline (control), 1% AMO3 and 50% AMO3 (overdose), respectively. Then, experimental dermatophytosis was induced in CF1 mice. Seventy-five individuals were selected and divided in 5 groups that were treated once a day with placebo, cream with 1%, 2% and 3% AMO3 plus an untreated control group. This new natural product showed antifungal activity against all strains studied. The MIC ranged between was 0,125 and 1%, while minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was 2%. The application of vaseline and AMO3 1% and 50% did not produce clinical or histopathological lesions. The mice with dermatophytosis that were treated with 1%, 2% and 3% AMO3 showed 100% clinical cure and 94% average mycological cure, exceeding placebo and control groups (p < 0,05). This product exhibits high antifungal activity and could be a safe alternative for ringworm topical treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Mayor Santiago, Chile."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thomson M", "ForeName": "Pamela", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anticevic C", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez B", "ForeName": "H\u00e9ctor", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva V", "ForeName": "V\u00edctor", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Actividad antif\u00fangica y perfil de seguridad del producto natural derivado del aceite de maravilla ozonizado (AMO3) en dermatofitos."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Chile", "MedlineTA": "Rev Chilena Infectol", "NlmUniqueID": "9305754", "ISSNLinking": "0716-1018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sunflower Oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arthrodermataceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tinea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22286673", "S0716-10182011000700002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
