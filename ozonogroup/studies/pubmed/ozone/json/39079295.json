This study employs a specialized apparatus to analyze RMA's emission behavior, focusing on crumb rubber size variations under thermal conditions. Ozone Formation Potential (OFP) and Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation Potential (SOAFP) were quantified to evaluate the environmental burden. Results indicate distinct periods of emission behavior for different pollutants, with H<sub>2</sub>S emissions primarily occurring within the initial 150\u00a0min while volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dominate within the first 270\u00a0min. The size of rubber particles and thermal exposure duration influence the VOCs microscopic emission characteristics and environmental burdens. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emerge as the primary contributors to OFP and SOAFP, accounting for nearly 65\u00a0% and 25\u00a0%-60\u00a0%, respectively. High molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbons (ALHs) also significantly contribute to SOAFP, with PAHs dominating throughout, while ALHs peak during the middle stage. H<sub>2</sub>S emissions likely stem from rubber, while early VOC emissions originate from rubber, transitioning to petroleum asphalt during the middle and late stages. Asphalt fractions influence emission behavior and property evolution. These findings inform emission suppression strategies and highlight the need for tailored approaches to mitigate emissions effectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
