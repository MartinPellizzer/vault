Their superior performance can be attributed to their substantial specific surface area, high porosity, ease of modification, rapid recovery, and unparalleled chemical stability. This paper aims to comprehensively explore the progressive applications and underlying mechanisms of electrospun nanofibers in AOPs, which include Fenton-like processes, photocatalysis, catalytic ozonation, and persulfate oxidation. A detailed discussion on the mechanism and efficiency of the catalytic process, which is influenced by the primary components of the electrospun catalyst, is presented. Additionally, the paper examines how concentration, viscosity, and molecular weight affect the characteristics of the spinning materials and seeks to provide a thorough understanding of electrospinning technology to enhance water treatment methods. The review proposes that electrospun nanofiber membranes hold significant potential for enhancing water treatment processes using advanced oxidation methods. This is attributed to their advantageous properties and the tunable nature of the electrospinning process, paving the way for advancements in water treatment through AOPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
