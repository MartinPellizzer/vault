Two high yielding tropical rice cultivars (Malviya dhan 36 and Shivani) were evaluated against different concentrations of O3 under field conditions. Experimental design included filtered chambers, non-filtered chambers having ambient O3 and 10 and 20ppb elevated O3 above the ambient. Study was conducted to assess differential response if any in induction of antioxidative defense system, genome stability, leaf proteome, yield and quality of the product in both the test cultivars. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) were induced under ambient and elevated levels of O3. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of SOD, CAT and POD also displayed increased enzymatic activity along with associated alterations in specific isoforms. Ascorbic acid, thiols and phenolics were also stimulated at ambient and elevated O3. Structural alterations in DNA of rice plants due to O3 affecting its genome template stability (GTS) was examined using RAPD technique. 2-D PAGE revealed 25 differential spots in Malviya dhan 36 and 36 spots in Shivani after O3 treatment with reductions in RuBisCO subunits. Reductions in yield and change in the quality of grains were also noticed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.
