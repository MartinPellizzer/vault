An integrated catalytic ozonation/membrane filtration process applying Mn@CNM was employed to degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the removal achieved up to 81.3% during a 7-h continuous filtration. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching and radical detection experiments were conducted to determine the contribution of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, \u00b7OH and O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u00b7-</sup> towards the catalytic degradation of SMX. Moreover, Mn@CNM exhibited wide applicability for real water matrix and the total removal of various kinds of emerging contaminants in real hospital wastewater reached up to 98.5%. The excellent performances of Mn@CNM were attributed to the nano-confinement effect in the membrane layer. First, anchoring Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles on the pits of the APT surface suppressed the growth and aggregation of nanosized Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, providing abundant reactive sites for catalytic ozonation. Second, the interlaced APT nanofibers formed nano-sized network structures, where ROS and SMX were confined in close vicinity and ROS have more chances to attack SMX. This work provides a promising strategy for the preparation of catalytic ceramic membrane with high catalytic efficiency for degradation of emerging contaminants in water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
