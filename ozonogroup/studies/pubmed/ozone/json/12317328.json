However, this view needs to be changed since the proliferation of the automobile worldwide is leading to the poisoning of the environment and people. In the US the number of passenger cars grew 51% between 1971-86 and in the noncommunist industrialized community that figure is 71%. The gasoline and diesel fuel used to power the overwhelming majority of cars creates a variety of problems. The pollution is estimated to have a hidden cost of US $.80/gallon. Others estimate that the pollution causes 30,000 premature deaths annually just in the US. 75% of the carbon monoxide (CO), 48% of nitrogen oxides (NO2), 13% of particulates (P), and 3% of sulfur (S) emissions come from cars in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. 17% of all worldwide carbon dioxide (CO2) emission comes from the production and use of fossil fuels for cars. The single biggest problem associated with cars is the photochemical smog they create in urban areas. In 1986 75 million Americans lived in areas that failed to meet national air quality standards for CO, P, and ozone (03). The only area of major improvement has been the removal of lead from gasoline. It was known to cause problems from the beginning of its use in the 1920s, but remained for 50 years because of auto and oil company pressure. Ground 03 is estimated by the US government to cost US $4 billion in annual losses, just for corn, wheat, soybeans, and peanuts. Acid rain is the other major problem associated with cars, and its damage is estimated at US $5 billion annually. Both these problems are shortterm, their effects occur immediately; the longterm disadvantage is the build up of CO2 and its contribution to the greenhouse effect. While the US is at the forefront of regulation and many other countries are modeling their emission regulations after the US, the current system will not result in clean air. The government must not be guided by the auto and oil industries when determining the regulations to make the air clean."]}], "OtherID": ["071738", "00210743"], "PMID": "12317328", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0896-0615", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "6", "PubDate": {"Year": "1988", "Season": "Nov-Dec"}}, "Title": "World watch", "ISOAbbreviation": "World Watch"}, "ArticleTitle": "Car sick.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "36", "EndPage": "43", "MedlinePgn": "36-43"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Renner", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "World Watch", "NlmUniqueID": "101084441", "ISSNLinking": "0896-0615"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy-Generating Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Financial Management"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greenhouse Effect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Care Rationing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legislation as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transportation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12317328"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
