We used a novel WoE framework based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards causal framework for this analysis. Specifically, we critically evaluated and integrated the relevant epidemiology and experimental animal data and classified a causal determination based on categories proposed by the Institute of Medicine's 2008 report, Improving the Presumptive Disability Decision-making Process for Veterans. We found that the risks of CV effects are largely null across human and experimental animal studies. The few positive associations reported in studies of CV morbidity and mortality are very small in magnitude, mainly reported in single-pollutant models, and likely attributable to bias, chance, or confounding. The few positive effects in experimental animal studies were observed mainly in ex vivo studies at high exposures, and even the in vivo findings are not likely relevant to humans. The available data also do not support a biologically plausible mechanism for the effects of ozone on the CV system. Overall, the current WoE provides no convincing case for a causal relationship between long-term exposure to ambient ozone and adverse effects on the CV system in humans, but the limitations of the available studies preclude definitive conclusions regarding a lack of causation; thus, we categorize the strength of evidence for a causal relationship between long-term exposure to ozone and CV effects as \"below equipoise.\""]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gradient , Cambridge, MA , USA."}], "LastName": "Prueitt", "ForeName": "Robyn L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Heather N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zu", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sax", "ForeName": "Sonja N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Venditti", "ForeName": "Ferdinand J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goodman", "ForeName": "Julie E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914275", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8444"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Chronic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25257962", "10.3109/10408444.2014.937855"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
