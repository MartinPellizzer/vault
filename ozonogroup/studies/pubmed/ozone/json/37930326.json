Up to now, most C<sub>1</sub> compounds in the environment were associated with complex metabolic and enzymatic pathways in organisms or to combustion processes of organic matter. We now present compelling evidence that many C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> compounds have a common origin in methyl groups of methyl-substituted substrates that are cleaved by the iron oxide-mediated formation of methyl radicals. This scenario is derived from experiments with a mechanistically well-studied bispidine-iron-oxido complex as oxidant and dimethyl sulfoxide as the environmentally relevant model substrate and is supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory and ab initio quantum-chemical studies. The exhaustive experimental model studies, also involving extensive isotope labeling, are complemented with the substitution of the bispidine model system by environmentally relevant iron oxides and, finally, a collection of soils with varying iron and organic matter contents. The combination of all data suggests that the iron oxide-mediated formation of methyl radicals from methyl-substituted substrates is a common abiotic source for widespread C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> compounds in the environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Geowissenschaften, INF 234-236, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "H\u00e4deler", "ForeName": "Jonas", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3244-2690"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anorganisch-Chemisches Institut INF 270, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Velmurugan", "ForeName": "Gunasekaran", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Geowissenschaften, INF 234-236, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Lauer", "ForeName": "Rebekka", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anorganisch-Chemisches Institut INF 270, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Radhamani", "ForeName": "Rejith", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2766-8812"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Geowissenschaften, INF 234-236, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heidelberg Center for the Environment (HCE), Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Keppler", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7796-3532"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anorganisch-Chemisches Institut INF 270, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing, INF 205, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Comba", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37930326", "10.1021/jacs.3c06709"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
