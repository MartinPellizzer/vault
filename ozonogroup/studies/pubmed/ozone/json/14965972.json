One possible reason for the wide tolerance to stress in seedlings is their inherently large pool of carbohydrate reserves, which is available for maintenance during and regrowth after periods of stress. We tested for the effects of foliar N and exposure to ozone on foliar carbohydrate reserves of 20-year-old naturally regenerated saplings. The trees were maintained in native soil in 360-l containers for 5 years before the experiment. The year before the experiment, trees were fertilized with N,P,K to provide a population of trees from N deficient to N sufficient. As foliar N decreased below 0.9%, length of current-year shoots and specific needle area of current-year needles declined. Foliar N concentration was correlated with foliar sugar and starch concentrations, but relationships varied with time of year. Before bud break, foliar carbohydrates and N, in general, were positively correlated, and date of bud break was delayed in N-deficient trees. During active growth, foliar soluble sugars and N were positively correlated, but starch concentrations were negatively correlated with N. By late September, neither starch nor sugar concentration was correlated with N concentration. Ozone and foliar N concentrations did not interact to change foliar carbohydrate concentrations or shoot and needle growth in this relatively short-term study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Cornell University, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amundson", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohut", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laurence", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14965972", "10.1093/treephys/15.3.167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
