Days with a maximum daily 8-h average(MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> higher(lower) than 160 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> were defined as polluted(clean) days. Differences in the source contribution between clean days and polluted days were compared, and a typical pollution period was selected for further process analysis. The results showed that NO<sub>2</sub> in Zibo mainly came from local emissions in summer, with a relative contribution of 45.1%. Vehicle emissions(33.8%) and natural sources(20.7%) were the primary NO<sub>2</sub> sources. VOC contributions from natural sources, solvent usage, and the petrochemical industry were significant, with a total contribution of 78.5%. The MDA8 contribution from local sources was 21.4%, whereas the impact of regional transport(32%) and surrounding cities(26.8%) was also substantial. Among local emission sources, vehicle emissions, the power industry, and the building materials industry contributed 10.9%-18.8% to local MDA8. On O<sub>3</sub> pollution days, the MDA8 contribution from local emissions and surrounding cities increased. However, the relative contributions from local sources were similar under different pollution conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution and Health, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin-Xin", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Zibo Ecological Environment Bureau Jingkai District Branch Bureau, Zibo 255000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiu-Ying", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution and Health, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution and Health, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution and Health, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Jin-Ting", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution and Health, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Pollution and Health, School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38098385", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202210054"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
