The dumping area (LDA) and leachate storage pool (LSP) of two typical rural domestic waste landfill sites in north China (NLF) and southwest China (SLF) were investigated. We found that 45, 46, 61 and 68 volatile organic compounds (VOC) were present in the air of NLF-LDA, NLF-LSP, SLF-LDA, and SLF-LSP, respectively. And there were 27, 29, 35 and 37 kinds of odorous compounds being detected. Oxygenated compounds (>48.88%), chlorinated compounds (>6.85%), and aromatics (>5.46%), such as organic acid, 1-chlorobutane, and benzene, were the most abundant compounds in both landfills. The SLF-LDA had the highest olfactory effect, with a corresponding total odor activity value of 29,635.39. The ozone-formation potential analysis showed that VOCs emitted from SLF landfills had significantly higher potential for ozone formation than those from NLF landfills, with ozone generation potentials of 166.02, 225.86, 2511.82, and 1615.99\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup> for the NLF-LDA, NLF-LSP, SLF-LDA, and SLF-LSP, respectively. Higher chronic toxicity and cancer risk of VOCs were found in the SLF according to method of Risk Assessment Information System. Based on the sensitivity analysis by the Monte Carlo method, concentrations of benzene, propylene oxide, propylene, trichloroethylene, and N-nitrosodiethylamine, along with exposure duration, daily exposure time, and annual exposure frequency, significantly impacted the risk levels. We provide a scientific basis, which reflects the need for controlling and reducing gaseous pollutants from landfills, particularly rural residential landfills, which may improve rural sanitation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
