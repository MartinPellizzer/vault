Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sampling during an O<sub>3</sub> pollution event and a PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution episode was conducted at an urban site and a street canyon in Zhengzhou, China. It has been determined that street canyons suffer from more severe particle and NO<sub>x</sub> pollution than the urban site. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub> has been identified as a significant or emerging pollutant in street canyon environments. In terms of VOCs, the street canyon exhibits 1.4 and 1.1 times higher total VOC concentrations compared to the urban site during the O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution episodes, respectively. In the street canyon location, there was a slight increase in the proportion of alkanes and aromatics, while the proportions of oxygenated VOCs and halogenated hydrocarbons decreased. Source apportionment analysis reveals that street canyons were more susceptible to the accumulation of VOCs from coating solvent, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), and gasoline additives. Consequently, the environmental impacts of VOCs originating from coating solvent and LPG were more pronounced in the street canyon location compared to the urban site. The trends of NO<sub>x</sub> concentration indicate that future continuously stricter vehicle emission standards and control policies can further reduce vehicle exhaust emissions and more attention needs to be focused on the reduction of non-exhaust emissions (i.e., coating solvent) and LPG vehicles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
