The average concentration of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 25.4 \u00b1 18.4 ppbv, and an increasing trend (+12.2 %) was observed. Alkanes were the most abundant VOC group among all seasons, accounting for 43.5 % of TVOCs. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), aromatics, halides and alkenes contributed 15.9 %, 15.7 %, 11.7 % and 10.3 % of TVOCs concentration, respectively. Biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) and OVOCs showed distinguished diurnal cycle from primary anthropogenic VOCs. Photochemical reactivity analysis based on ozone formation potential (OFP) and OH loss rate (L<sup>OH</sup>) indicated that aromatics and alkenes were the most significant contributor, respectively. Toluene, xylene (m/p- and o-), ethene and propene were the largest contributor of annual OFP, with the mean OFP being 33.8 \u00b1 44.3 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, 31.9 \u00b1 32.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, 9.29 \u00b1 11.4 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, 22.1 \u00b1 21.3 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 12.8 \u00b1 19.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Seven sources were identified with positive matrix factorization (PMF): petrochemical industry (13.8 %), biogenic emission (1.0 %), solvent usage-toluene (16.9 %), vehicular exhaust (43.8 %), Integrated circuits industry (3.8 %), solvent usage-C8 aromatics (10.9 %), and gasoline evaporation (9.8 %). Vehicular exhaust was the most significant source (43.8 %) during the whole measurement period. Solvent usage, petrochemical industry, and gasoline evaporation showed high temperature dependency. The integrated contribution of solvent usage and industrial processes were higher than vehicular exhaust during hot months. These sources also have higher chemical reactivities and can contribute more on O<sub>3</sub> formation. Our results are helpful on determining the control strategies aiming at alleviating O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
