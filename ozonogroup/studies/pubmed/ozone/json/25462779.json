Nevertheless, the contribution of the propagation reactions (in brief, OH\u2022 + DOM (Dissolved Organic Matter) + O\u2082 \u2192 O\u2082\u2022\u207b, O\u2083 + O\u2082\u2022\u207b \u2192 O\u2083\u2022\u207b \u2192 OH\u2022) to the OH\u2022 yields (\u0424) in these two processes has not received great attention so far. In this study, >25% of O\u2083 was estimated to be consumed via the propagation reactions in ozonation of wastewater effluents. The competition method (taking the OH\u2022 exposure and scavenging capacity of water matrix into account) was recommended to determine the \u0424 values, and thus the relatively higher values (i.e., 33\u201358% vs. 6\u201324%) in ozonation were obtained as compared with the \"tert-Butanol (tBuOH) assay\" (with excess tBuOH to scavenge OH\u2022 producing stoichiometric formaldehyde), where the contribution of the propagation reactions was otherwise neglected when excess tBuOH completely scavenged OH. In peroxone of wastewater effluents, the rate constant of O\u2083 consumption increased significantly with the increase of H\u2082O\u2082 concentration ([H\u2082O\u2082]:[O\u2083] = 0.1\u20130.35). However, compared to ozonation alone, the improvement of the \u0424 values was negligible over a wide range of [H\u2082O\u2082]:[O\u2083] = 0.1\u20132.0. This discrepancy was mainly ascribed to the fact that substantial O\u2083 consumption via the propagation reactions resulted in comparable \u0424 values in peroxone vs. ozonation processes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yongze", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Congwei", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huangfu", "ForeName": "Xiaoliu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Zhongkai", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MD83SFE959", "NameOfSubstance": "tert-Butyl Alcohol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "tert-Butyl Alcohol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25462779", "10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.050", "S0043-1354(14)00748-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
