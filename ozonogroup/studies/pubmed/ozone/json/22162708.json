Environmental factors, especially indoor and outdoor air quality, may play an important role in triggering acute exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. The authors have reviewed the literature reporting effects of outdoor and indoor pollutants on FeNO in children. Although the findings are not consistent, urban and industrial pollution-mainly particles (PM(2.5) and PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and sulfur dioxide (SO(2))-as well as formaldehyde and electric baseboard heating have been shown to increase FeNO, whilst ozone (O(3)) tends to decrease it. Among children exposed to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) with a genetic polymorphisms in nitric oxide synthase genes (NOS), a higher nicotine exposure was associated with lower FeNO levels. Finally, although more studies are needed in order to better investigate the effect of gene and environment interactions which may affect the interpretation of FeNO values in the management of children with asthma, clinicians are recommended to consider environmental exposures when taking medical histories for asthma and respiratory allergy. Further research is also needed to assess the effects of remedial interventions aimed at reducing/abating environmental exposures in asthmatic/allergic patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health and Environment Unit, Regional Agency for Environment Protection/ARPA, Sicilia, Corso Calatafimi 217, 90129 Palermo, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "La Grutta", "ForeName": "Stefania", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrante", "ForeName": "Giuliana", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malizia", "ForeName": "Velia", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cibella", "ForeName": "Fabio", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Viegi", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy (Cairo)", "NlmUniqueID": "101535174", "ISSNLinking": "1687-9783"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Pijnenburg MWH, De Jongste JC.
