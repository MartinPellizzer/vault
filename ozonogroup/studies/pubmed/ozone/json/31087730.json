Some of the most noxious pollutants that humans are exposed to include ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ), particulate matter (PM), and cigarette smoke (CS). Since the skin is the first line of defense against environmental insults, it is considered one of the main target organs for the harmful insults of air pollution. Thus, there is solid evidence that skin pathologies such as premature aging, atopic dermatitis (AD), and psoriasis are associated with pollutant exposure; all of these skin conditions are also associated with an altered redox status. Therefore, although the mechanisms of action and concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> , PM, and CS that we are exposed to differ, exposure to all of these pollutants is associated with the development of similar skin conditions due to the fact that all of these pollutants alter redox homeostasis, increasing reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress. A main product of oxidative stress, induced by exposure to the aforementioned pollutants, is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which derives from the oxidation of \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. HNE is a highly reactive compound that can form adducts with cellular proteins and even DNA; it is also an efficient cell signaling molecule able to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and the activity of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as Nrf2, AP1, and NF\u03baB. Therefore, increased levels of HNE in the skin, in response to pollutants, likely accelerates skin aging and exacerbates existing skin inflammatory conditions; thus, targeting HNE formation could be an innovative cosmeceutical approach for topical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plants for Human Health Institute, Department of Animal Sciences, North Carolina State University, Kannapolis, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pecorelli", "ForeName": "Alessandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plants for Human Health Institute, Department of Animal Sciences, North Carolina State University, Kannapolis, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodby", "ForeName": "Brittany", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prieux", "ForeName": "Roxane", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plants for Human Health Institute, Department of Animal Sciences, North Carolina State University, Kannapolis, North Carolina."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8792-0947"], "LastName": "Valacchi", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "765602", "Agency": "Marie Sklodowska-Curie", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "European Union's Horizon 2020", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biofactors", "NlmUniqueID": "8807441", "ISSNLinking": "0951-6433"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K1CVM13F96", "NameOfSubstance": "4-hydroxy-2-nonenal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco Smoke Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087730", "10.1002/biof.1513"]}}]}
