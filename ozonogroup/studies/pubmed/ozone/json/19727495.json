In the first study, ozone uptake by the pyrene film was determined using a coated-wall flow tube system. In the second, pyrene loss within the film upon exposure to ozone was monitored using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. The dependence of the reactive loss rate on ozone concentration observed in both methods suggests that the reaction proceeds via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type surface mechanism. At a mixing ratio of 50 ppb, the steady-state reactive uptake coefficient of ozone by pyrene films increased from 5.0x10(-6) in the dark to 3.7x10(-5) upon exposure to near-UV radiation (300-420 nm). The uptake coefficient increased linearly as a function of UV-A spectral irradiance and decreased markedly with increasing relative humidity. The loss of surface pyrene upon exposure to ozone also displayed a light enhancement: analysis of Langmuir-Hinshelwood plots for the light and dark reactions revealed a small increase in the two-dimensional reaction rate in the presence of light (lambda>or=295 nm). This modest enhancement, however, was less significant than the corresponding enhancement in the loss of gas-phase ozone. In order to explain these observations, we present an integrated mechanism whereby the light-enhanced ozone uptake arises from the reaction of ozone with O2(1Sigmag+) formed via energy transfer from excited-state pyrene and the enhanced pyrene loss occurs via the formation of a charge-transfer complex between excited-state pyrene and adsorbed ozone. The disparity between surface- and gas-phase results underscores the important role that multifaceted strategies can play in elucidating the mechanisms of heterogeneous atmospheric reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3H6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Styler", "ForeName": "Sarah A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brigante", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D'Anna", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Donaldson", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19727495", "10.1039/b904180j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
