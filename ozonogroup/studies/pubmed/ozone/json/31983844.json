In the present study, the efficacy of ozone water irrigation as an adjunct to scaling and root planing was evaluated in the treatment of generalized chronic periodontitis.", "Twenty-four patients with chronic periodontitis selected for the study were randomly divided into Group A and Group B, receiving ozone water irrigation and distilled water irrigation, respectively, after scaling and root planing. Subgingival plaque was collected from the selected investigational teeth and was analyzed using BANA-Zyme\u2122 Processor to evaluate the \"red complex\" periodontal pathogens. The clinical and microbiological parameters were recorded at baseline, 14 days, 21 days, and 2 months.", "The mean probing pocket depth scores for Group A and Group B at the baseline were 6.833 \u00b1 1.193 and 7.833 \u00b1 1.276; on day 14<sup>th</sup>, they were 6.616 \u00b1 1.403 and 7.083 \u00b1 1.378; on day 21<sup>st</sup>, they were 5.166 \u00b1 0.937 and 6.083 \u00b1 1.443;and on the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, they were 4.500 \u00b1 0.797 and 5.166 \u00b1 1.029, respectively. At the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, in Group A, 9 samples showed BANA negative and 3 samples showed BANA positive, and in Group B, 12 samples showed BANA negative and 0 sample showed BANA positive. The microbiological analysis showed a reduction in periodontal pathogens in both the groups.", "Significant improvement in both clinical and microbiological parameters suggests that subgingival ozonated water irrigation could be an efficient adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital, Hassan, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Vasthavi", "ForeName": "Chandrappa", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital, Hassan, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Babu", "ForeName": "Harsha Mysore", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital, Hassan, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Rangaraju", "ForeName": "Vivekananda Marenahalli", "Initials": "VM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital, Hassan, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Dasappa", "ForeName": "Shivaprasad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics, Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital, Hassan, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Jagadish", "ForeName": "Leka", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JSS Dental College and Hospital, Mysore, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Shivamurthy", "ForeName": "Ravindra", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Indian Soc Periodontol", "NlmUniqueID": "101499342", "ISSNLinking": "0972-124X"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Holt SC, Ebersole JL.
