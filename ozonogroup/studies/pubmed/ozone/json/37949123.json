Oxidation of VOCs, with the participation of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), leads to the formation of tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Accurately apportioning the emission sources and transformation processes of ambient VOCs, and effectively estimation of OH reactivity and ozone formation potential (OFP) will play an important role in reducing O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the atmosphere and improving public health. In this study, field measurements were conducted at a regional background site (Hok Tsui; HT) in Hong Kong from October to November 2020 with proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). VOC data coupled with air mass back trajectory cluster analysis and receptor modelling were applied to reveal the pollution pattern, emission sources and transformation of ambient VOCs at HT in autumn 2020. Seven sources were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, namely vehicular + industrial, solvent usage, primary oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), secondary OVOCs 1, secondary OVOCs 2 (aged), biogenic emissions, and background + biomass burning. Secondary formation and vehicular + industrial emissions are the vital sources of ambient VOCs at HT supersite, contributing to 20.8\u00a0% and 46.7\u00a0% of total VOC mixing ratios, respectively. Integrated with backward trajectory analysis and correlations of VOCs with their oxidation products, short-range transport of air masses from inland regions of southeast China brought high levels of total VOCs but longer-range transport of air masses brought more secondary OVOCs in aged air masses. Photolysis of OVOCs was the most important contributor to OH reactivity and OFP, among which aldehyde was the dominant contributor. The results of this study highlight the photochemical processing of VOCs from different source regions which should be considered in strategy making for pollution reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
