In this study, 26 LPG-fueled taxis in Guangzhou, south China were tested using a chassis dynamometer to obtain their emission factors of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under idle and cruising (10-60\u00a0km\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>) modes. The emission factors of NO<sub>x</sub> on average increased with speed from 4.13\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup> at idling to 71.1\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup> at 60\u00a0km\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> at a slope of 10.6\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup> per 10\u00a0km\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> increase in speed. Alkanes were the most abundant (71.9%) among the VOCs in the exhaust, followed by alkenes (25.2%), ethyne (2.7%), and aromatic species (0.2%). Emission factors of VOCs at idling averaged 8.24\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup>, higher than that of 6.23-7.36\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup> when cruising at 10-60\u00a0km\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup>, but their ozone formation potentials (OFPs) were lower at idling (15.8\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup>) than under cruising (19.1-23.8\u00a0g kg-fuel<sup>-1</sup>) largely due to higher emission of more reactive alkenes under cruising mode. Emissions of both NOx and VOCs increased significantly with mileages. Measured emission factors of NO<sub>x</sub> and reactive VOCs in this study suggested that replacing the gasoline-powered taxis with the LPG-fueled taxis with LPG-gasoline bi-fuel engines and no efficient after-treatment devices would not benefit in reducing the emissions of ozone precursors, and strengthening the emission control for LPG vehicles with dedicated LPG engines and after-treatment converters, as did in Hong Kong, could further benefit in reducing the emission of photochemically active species when using LPG as alternative fuels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
