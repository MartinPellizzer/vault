Results showed that average concentrations of benzene, toluene, <i>m</i>-xylene, and <i>o</i>-xylene were 21.7, 63.6, 33.9, and 98.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Compared with other cities both in China and elsewhere, benzene and toluene pollution can be considered to be of medium level, while xylene pollution is serious. Wind direction, T/B ratio, and correlation with CO were also analyzed, together with BTX sources. Result showed that the T/B ratio was 0.8-4.5, with correlation coefficients of benzene, toluene, and CO of 0.55 and 0.34, respectively. These values indicate that benzene and toluene are mainly derived from automotive emissions, also affected by surrounding industrial parks. Xylene is mainly derived from a coating industrial park north of the observation site. It was shown that high night-time concentrations of benzene and toulene could be due to industrial emissions from the industrial parks around the observation site. The ozone formation potential is in the order of <i>o</i>-xylene > <i>m</i>-xylene > toulene > benzene at the observation site. The ozone formation potential of xylene accounted for 85% of total ozone formation potential, indicating that emissions from surrounding industrial parks contribute greatly to ozone formation in the area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Fan-Hao", "Initials": "FH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Shuai-Xi", "Initials": "SX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Regional Atmospheric Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen 361021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Pin-Hua", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Hui-Hui", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wu", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environment Optics and Technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ang", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center, Heifei 230071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center, Heifei 230071, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30188046", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201712250"]}}]}
