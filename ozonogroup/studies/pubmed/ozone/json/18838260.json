Recently, chemical oxidation has been developed as a method for the early-stabilization of landfills. However, by-products that are difficult to detect by chemical analysis can be produced by this method. Therefore, toxicity tests are useful tools for detecting the changes of leachate quality after application of this method. The heat source in the A landfill was analyzed by organic position inquiry technology, and ozone-treated leachate was sprayed back to the heat source in the landfill. Toxicity changes of the leachate after the spray were monitored using Microtoxtrade mark, ToxScreen-II, and DaphTox tests. The hardly-degradable organic matter was efficiently removed and toxicities of the leachate in the heat source decreased after the application. These toxicity results were significantly related to chemical oxygen demand (COD) changes. Thus, it was concluded that the toxicity tests were effective for monitoring the leachate quality after applying the chemical oxidation method for landfill stabilization, and its incorporation to establish the criteria for early-stabilization of landfill sites needs to be considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Engineering, Collaboration Center 3F, Fukuoka University, Wakamatu-ku, Fukuoka 808-0135, Japan. tox0517@gmail.com <tox0517@gmail.com>"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Eun-ah", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tameda", "ForeName": "Kazuo", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hanashima", "ForeName": "Masataka", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Tatsuyoshi", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higuchi", "ForeName": "Sotaro", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Waste Manag", "NlmUniqueID": "9884362", "ISSNLinking": "0956-053X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18838260", "10.1016/j.wasman.2008.08.003", "S0956-053X(08)00270-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
