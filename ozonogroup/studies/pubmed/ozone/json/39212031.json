Thus, a detailed study of the gas-phase oxidation of the first-generation chlorofluorocarbon alternative HCFC-234fb by a reaction with hydroxyl radicals and chlorine atoms is important to understand its harmful effects on the environment. In this work, we have performed quantum chemical calculations to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the titled reaction. The potential energy profile calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/cc-pVTZ level of theory shows that the major reaction pathway involves the abstraction of the H-atom from the central carbon atom, C<sub>2</sub>, giving rise to the product radical CF<sub>3</sub>C\u02d9HCCl<sub>2</sub>F. The calculated rate-coefficients for the reaction with \u02d9OH and Cl-atoms are 3.89 \u00d7 10<sup>-15</sup> and 2.54 \u00d7 10<sup>-17</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, at 298 K and are in accordance with the experimental rate coefficients. The results suggest that the rate-coefficient for the reaction of DTP with \u02d9OH is two orders of magnitude higher than that with Cl-atoms, indicating greater significance of the former reaction in the atmosphere. With the rate-coefficient values, the lifetime and the radiative efficiency were calculated to be 8.2 years and 0.246 W m<sup>-2</sup> ppb<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. A 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 712 was also estimated using the lifetime corrected radiative efficiency value."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, Assam - 781039, India. msarma@iitg.ac.in."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4303-1379"], "LastName": "Changmai", "ForeName": "Rabu Ranjan", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, Assam - 781039, India. msarma@iitg.ac.in."}], "Identifier": ["0009-0005-9201-2854"], "LastName": "Daimari", "ForeName": "Samsung Raja", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, Assam - 781039, India. msarma@iitg.ac.in."}], "Identifier": ["0009-0003-5217-3851"], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "Anand Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, Assam - 781039, India. msarma@iitg.ac.in."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5200-2273"], "LastName": "Sarma", "ForeName": "Manabendra", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39212031", "10.1039/d4cp01643b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
