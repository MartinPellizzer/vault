Citizens were further linked to regional datasets for COVID-19 case ascertainment (positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens) and to define age, sex, living in a residential care home, population density and comorbidities. We estimated rate ratios and additional numbers of cases per 1\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in air pollutants from single- and bi-pollutant Poisson regression models.", "The 62 848 residents generated 4408 cases. Yearly average PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was 12.5\u2009\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>. Age, living in a residential care home, history of stroke and medications for diabetes, hypertension and obstructive airway diseases were independently associated with COVID-19. In single-pollutant multivariate models, PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with a 5.1% increase in the rate of COVID-19 (95%\u2009CI 2.7% to 7.5%), corresponding to 294 additional cases per 100 000 person-years. The association was confirmed in bi-pollutant models; excluding subjects in residential care homes; and further adjusting for area-based indicators of socioeconomic level and use of public transportation. Similar findings were observed for PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and NO. Ozone was associated with a 2% decrease in disease rate, the association being reversed in bi-pollutant models.", "Long-term exposure to low levels of air pollutants, especially PM<sub>2.5</sub>, increased the incidence of COVID-19.
