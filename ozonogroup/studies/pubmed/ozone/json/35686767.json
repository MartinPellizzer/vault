At the same time, the main emission sources were determined using a PMF model, and the chemical reactivity of VOCs was evaluated using the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) method and fractional aerosol coefficients (FAC). The results showed that the urban area of Yuncheng was seriously polluted by VOCs and NO<sub>2</sub> in the early morning and evening during summer, the peak value of VOCs daily variation occurred at 08:00 and 20:00, respectively, and was mainly affected by the morning and evening peaks in traffic. The <i>\u03c1</i>(VOCs) from June to August was 50.52 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and the species with the highest proportion were alkanes (39.39%) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs, 34.63%). Five VOCs emission sources were determined by the PMF model, of which the largest contribution was from motor vehicle exhaust emission sources (33.10%), followed by industrial emission sources (29.46%), natural gas and coal combustion sources (17.31%), solvent use sources (11.94%), and plant emission sources (8.19%). Controlling motor vehicle exhaust emission sources is the key to alleviate VOCs pollution in summer in Yuncheng City. The average ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs was 162.88 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, in which OVOCs had the highest contribution rate (45.37%); acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, ethylene, isoprene, and toluene were the key active components; and industrial emission sources were the emission sources with the highest contribution rate. The average value of secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOA<sub>p</sub>) of VOCs was 0.40 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, in which the contribution rate of aromatic hydrocarbons was the highest (88.00%), and the solvent use source was the emission source with the highest contribution rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwestern University, Xi'an 710127, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwestern University, Xi'an 710127, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Wen-Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwestern University, Xi'an 710127, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Shu-Zhen", "Initials": "SZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwestern University, Xi'an 710127, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwestern University, Xi'an 710127, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-Tao", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Urban and Environmental Science, Northwestern University, Xi'an 710127, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun-Jie", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin-Gang", "Initials": "XG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35686767", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202109134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
