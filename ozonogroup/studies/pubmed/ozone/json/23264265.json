O3 differentially and separately regulated 620 and 130 genes in the panicles and grains. Among the O3-responsive genes, 176 and 444 genes were up- and down-regulated in panicle compared to 24 and 106 genes in grain, respectively. Further mapping revealed that the majority of differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in signaling, hormonal, cell wall, transcription, proteolysis, and defense events. Many previously unknown O3-responsive novel genes were identified. Inventory of 745 O3-responsive genes and their mapping will expand our knowledge on novel regulatory processes in both panicles and grains of rice; and, serve as a resource towards the designing of rice crops for future high-O3world.", "Tropospheric ozone (O3) severely affects agricultural production worldwide. Present study aims to reveal a detailed O3 responsive gene network in panicle and grains of rice plants through transcriptomics approach. Our results provide an insight into the basis of O3-response in rice plants, and will help to develop suitable rice genotype for future high O3- world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Biology Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8506, Japan. cho_kyoungwon@kbsi.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Kyoungwon", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibato", "ForeName": "Junko", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "Akihiro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohno", "ForeName": "Yoshihisa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satoh", "ForeName": "Kouji", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kikuchi", "ForeName": "Shoshi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Ganesh Kumar", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarkar", "ForeName": "Abhijit", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakwal", "ForeName": "Randeep", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "8008051", "ISSNLinking": "0141-5492"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microarray Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23264265", "10.1007/s10529-012-1118-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
