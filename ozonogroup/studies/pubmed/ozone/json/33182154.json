In this review, HAOPs were categorized into three parts: (1) direct reaction of HA with oxidants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), peroxymonosulfate (PMS), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), ferrate (Fe(VI)), periodate (IO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>)); (2) HA driven homogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like system (Fe(II)/peroxide/HA system, Cu(II)/O<sub>2</sub>/HA system, Cu(II)/peroxide/HA system, Ce(IV)/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/HA system); (3) HA driven heterogeneous Fe/Cu-Fenton/Fenton-like system (iron-bearing material/peroxide/HA system, copper-bearing material/peroxide/HA system, bimetallic composite/peroxide/HA system). Degradation efficiency of the target pollutant, reactive intermediates, and effective pH range of various HAOPs were summarized. Further, corresponding reaction mechanism was elaborated. For the direct reaction of HA with oxidants, improvement of pollutants degradation was achieved through the generation of secondary reactive intermediates which had higher reactivity compared with the parent oxidant. For HA driven homogeneous and heterogeneous Fe/Cu-Fenton/Fenton-like system, improvement of pollutants degradation was achieved mainly via the acceleration of redox cycle of Fe(III)/Fe(II) or Cu(II)/Cu(I) and subsequent generation of reactive intermediates, which avoided the drawbacks of classical Fenton/Fenton-like system. In addition, HA driven homogeneous Fe/Cu-Fenton/Fenton-like system with heterogeneous counterpart were compared. Further, formation of oxidation products from HA in various HAOPs was summarized. Finally, the challenges and prospects in this field were discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
