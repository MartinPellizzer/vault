This paper is a systematic analysis of VOCs emissions and distribution trends in 12 typical industrial sectors, garbage and wastewater treatment plants, comprehensive industrial parks, and residential districts in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta Regions. The results show that pharmacy, rubber producing, as well as paint spraying are the top three industries among the 12 typical industries with the highest average VOCs emission concentrations at 541, 499, and 450 mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. By comparison, the average emission concentration of VOCs from the pharmaceutical industry in Yangtze River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region was, respectively, about 112 and 1.00\u00d710<sup>3</sup> mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The paint spraying industry in the Pearl River Delta region has the highest emission rate with an average concentration of 1.04\u00d710<sup>3</sup> mg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. The investigation pertaining to the distribution of different VOCs categories indicates that highly toxic aromatics and halogenated hydrocarbons account for the highest emissions in paint spraying and pharmaceutical industries, reaching ratios of 55.99% and 26.57%, respectively. Additionally, among the three major economic zones, the VOCs concentration is the lowest in residential areas and comprehensive industrial parks in the Yangtze River Delta but the highest in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, which is consistent with the distribution of industrial emissions in each region. Moreover, the research reveals that VOCs concentration in residential districts experienced a fluctuating reduction from 2002 to 2018. The significant reduction since 2016 suggests that formulated policies, laws and standards, along with the performed techniques have made significant contributions to the control of VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environment Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Bo-Wen", "Initials": "BW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Luannan County Branch of Tangshan Ecology and Environment Bureau, Tangshan 063500, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Bo", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environment Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environment Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environment Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xi-Bin", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jin-Ling", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environment Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Gui-Jin", "Initials": "GJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33742899", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202008210"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
