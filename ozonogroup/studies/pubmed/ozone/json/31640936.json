Moreover, integrated odor management contributes to specific odor control at different waste treatment stages. In this study, odor emissions along typical MSW streams were categorized based on their olfactive and environmental impacts after a field investigation of the residential district (RD), transfer station (TS), and landfill (LF) in the Chongming Eco-island. It was found that odorants, especially NH<sub>3</sub> and sulfides, increased along the MSW stream, with total chemical concentration increasing from 1241.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009235.6 to 6947.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091726.8\u2009\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. Source separation and co-landfill system, which premixes the MSW with bottom ash (BA) at a ratio of 5:1, were speculated to efficiently attenuate odorants. Sulfides reduced owing to an increase in trace metal dissolution and carbon source consumption with the addition of BA at the LF, whereas NH<sub>3</sub> in the leachate pond increased due to enhanced biodegradation and alkalinity. Photochemical ozone formation (6.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup>-8.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup> personal equivalent, PE), nutrient enrichment (5.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup>-4.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup> PE), and acidification (4.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup>-4.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup> PE) were the major environmental impact categories. The priority odor pollutants screened using ternary fuzzy synthetic system could reflect the impact of olfaction and environment and greatly varied along the waste stream."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
