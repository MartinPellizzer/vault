Ozone therapy is used to reduce ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in several situations. An experimental study was designed to evaluate effect of ozone application in ovarian I/R injury.", "Three groups (n = 6) and 18 rats were included in the study. After anesthesia, right ovaries were fixed and removed at the end of 2 hours in sham group (SG). In torsion group (TG), right ovaries underwent 720\u00b0 torsion in a counterclockwise direction. Ovaries were removed after 2 hours torsion and 2 hours reperfusion. In ozone group (OG), torsion was created by the same technique, and 95% oxygen plus 5% ozone gas mixture was given intraperitoneally (25 \u03bcg/mL, 0.5 mg/kg) 10 minutes before reperfusion. After 2 hours reperfusion, ovaries were removed. Histopathologic examination of ovarian and periovarian sections was performed for the presence of congestion (C), hemorrhage, interstitial edema (IE), and polymorphonuclear neutrophilic infiltrations. Tissue samples were analyzed for malondialdehyde, nitric oxide (NO), and total sulphidryl (t-SH) values. Results were compared between 3 groups.", "At histopathologic examination, the TG have elevation in terms of ovarian C, polymorphonuclear neutrophilic infiltration, and periovarian IE when compared with SG (P < ,05). In OG, ovarian C and periovarian IE were reduced according to TG, whereas the increase was observed only in ovarian C compared with SG (P < .05). At biochemical evaluation of oxidative stress markers in SG and TG, there was no difference between them (P < .05). Malondialdehyde levels were significantly lower in OG than TG, whereas NO and t-SH values were higher (P < .05). Malondialdehyde levels were decreased in OG compared with SG (P < .05). However, no difference was observed in NO and t-SH levels (P > .05).", "Intraperitoneal application of ozone creates a positive impact on histologic and biochemical markers on I/R injury owing to ovarian torsion.
