The results showed that the concentrations of total phosphorus in aqueous phase (TP<sub>(A)</sub>) and orthophosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>-P) in ozonized sludge supernatant rose obviously with increasing ozone dose when ozone dose was below 61.2\u00a0mg\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>/gSS then almost kept constant. The TP<sub>(A)</sub> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>-P contents in the ozonized sludge supernatant were 70.9 and 63.3\u00a0mg/L when ozone dose was 61.2\u00a0mg\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>/gSS, respectively. Total phosphorus in the sludge solid (TP<sub>(S)</sub>) was mostly distributed in inorganic phosphorus (IP) (more than 81.5% of TP<sub>(S)</sub>), and non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) was the major component of IP in the sludge (more than 78.7% of IP) during ozonation. The release contribution (RC) of IP to TP<sub>(A)</sub> accounted for over 73.9%. The optimized conditions for the removal of phosphorus from ozonized sludge supernatant were set at an initial Mg<sup>2+</sup>/PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>-P molar ratio of 1.8, pH\u00a09.5, and reaction time of 5\u00a0min, under which the removal efficiencies of TP<sub>(A)</sub> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>-P were 43.1 and 52.2%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment (SKLUWRE), School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment (SKLUWRE), School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China. hit_tianyu@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment (SKLUWRE), School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150090, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AW3EJL1462", "NameOfSubstance": "Struvite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Refuse Disposal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Struvite"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28866811", "10.1007/s11356-017-0037-8", "10.1007/s11356-017-0037-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
