In this study, human lymphocytes have been exposed to O3 in vitro (1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 ppm/2 h) and then evaluated for the ability of B cells to produce immunoglobulin G (IgG) in response to the T-cell-dependent stimulus pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and to the T-cell-independent stimulus Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain (SAC). Suppression of IgG production was found with O3-exposed PWM-stimulated lymphocytes, while no effect of O3 was seen with SAC-stimulated cells, suggesting that T cells, but not B cells, were sensitive to O3. However, exposing either cell type alone to O3 indicated that both T cells and B cells were affected by the pollutant. The O3-exposed B cells produced less IgG in response to PWM but produced more IgG in response to SAC. On the other hand, O3-exposed T cells were suppressive in both PWM and SAC responses. Since the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells is regulated by complex interactions of cytokines secreted by T cells and antigen-presenting cells, possible O3-induced alterations in secretion of some of these regulatory lymphokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-gamma) were investigated in lymphocyte cultures stimulated with PWM. A decrease in IL-2 production was found, while in contrast, IL-6 production was significantly increased. IFN-gamma secretion was not altered, and IL-4 levels were below the limits of detectability. These results suggest that O3-induced changes in IgG production may be mediated by altered production by T cells of important immunoregulatory molecules, in addition to any direct effects of O3 on the IgG-producing cells themselves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ABB Environmental Services, Inc., Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Becker", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quay", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koren", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lymphokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pokeweed Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "B-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pokeweed Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1834858", "10.1080/15287399109531573"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
