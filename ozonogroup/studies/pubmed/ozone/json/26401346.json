Most prominent type of used oils is extra virgin olive oil. But still, each type of unsaturated oils may be used for ozonation. There are a lot of wrong knowledge on the internet about ozonated oils and its use as well. Just like other ozone therapy studies, also the studies about ozone oils are inadequate to avoid incorrect knowledge. Current data about ozone oil and its benefits are produced by supplier who oversees financial interests and make misinformation. Despite the rapidly increasing ozone oil sales through the internet, its quality and efficacy is still controversial. Dozens of companies and web sites may be easily found to buy ozonated oil. But, very few of these products are reliable, and contain sufficiently ozonated oil. This article aimed to introduce the troubles about ozonated oils and so to inform ozonated oil users."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Uysal", "ForeName": "Bulent", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Intercult Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101653911", "ISSNLinking": "2146-8397"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bocci V, Borrelli E, Travagli V, Zanardi I.
