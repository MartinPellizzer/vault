Visual analog scale (VAS) was measured pre-injection, then re-evaluated post-injection at 4 time points (1 week, 1 month, 3 months , and 6 months); Cochin Hand Function Scale (CHFS); and a median nerve electrophysiologic study was done before injection, then by the end of 3 months and 6 months.", "VAS was significantly lower in group M after 1 week (P = 0.01). Group O showed significantly lower VAS after 3 and 6 month (P < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the VAS during the whole study period within each group, in comparison to its baseline value. CHFS was significantly lower in the ozone group after 6 months (P < 0.001). The sixth month's sensory conduction was significantly higher in group O (P = 0.002).
