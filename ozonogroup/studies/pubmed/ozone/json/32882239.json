The RM was pretreated with HCl to investigate the effect of alkalinity. In the catalytic fast copyrolysis of the OL and PP, the acid-treated RM (HRM) produced more aromatics, phenolics, and light olefins (C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>) but less oxygenates and heavy olefins (C<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>46</sub>) than the RM. The difference in pyrolytic performance between the RM and HRM was likely attributed to the concentrated Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> species in the HRM catalyst. In addition, more efficient toluene removal was observed over MnO<sub>x</sub>/HRM than over MnO<sub>x</sub>/RM owing to the large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, high amounts of Al and Fe, and optimal Mn<sup>3+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> ratio. This study demonstrates that the RM, an industrial waste, can be reused as an effective catalytic material for not only biofuel production but also pollutant removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
