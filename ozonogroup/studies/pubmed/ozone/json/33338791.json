About 5%-10% of the total biogenic VHCs in the upper ocean were accumulated in the assemblage layer (AL) with high chlorophyll a. However, higher VHCs levels were observed in the dicothermal layer (DL) compared with the AL because of the preservation from winter and production from dinoflagellates and chlorophytes. Owing to the co-existence occurrence of sharp seasonal pycnocline and thick permanent pycnocline, DL could be an important VHCs reservoir in the upper water column during summer. In response to melting of sea ice and glacier, decreased salinity was responsible for ca. 50% of the variation in the CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub> concentrations, which corresponded with increased CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub> concentrations in the less saline water mass. Anthropogenic CCl<sub>4</sub> was found with an average concentration of 44.9\u00a0pmol/L, and there was a strong positive relationship between CCl<sub>4</sub> and CHCl<sub>3</sub> in the upper water, indicating their similar source of pollutant transport caused by anthropogenic activities. Calculated sea-to-air fluxes of CCl<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>, CHBrCl<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> averaged 478.7, 93.7, 33.7, and 61.8\u00a0nmol/(m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7d) in summer, respectively, indicating that the waters off the NAP are important sources of VHCs for the atmosphere and exert potentially adverse impacts on the Antarctica ozone depletion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
