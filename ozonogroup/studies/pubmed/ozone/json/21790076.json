Therefore, rotating packed contactors were introduced to improve the transfer of ozone from the gaseous phase to the solution phase, and the effect of several reaction parameters were investigated on the temporal variations of acetone concentration in aqueous solution. The decomposition rate constant of acetone was enhanced by increasing the rotor speed from 450 to 1800 rpm. Increasing the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/O3 molar ratios accelerated the decomposition rate until a certain optimum H2O2/O3 molar ratio was reached; further addition of H2O2 inhibited the decomposition of acetone, possibly because excessive amounts of H2O2 added might serve as a scavenger to deplete hydroxyl free radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan. ku508@mail.ntust.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Young", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yun-Jen", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hua-Wei", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Wei-Ming", "Initials": "WM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21790076", "10.2175/106143010x12851009156961"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
