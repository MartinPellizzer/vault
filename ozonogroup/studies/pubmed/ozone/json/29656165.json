Plant productivity is affected by several environmental factors, which interact with each other. Studies related to interactions involving O<sub>3</sub> and different levels of nitrogen (N) are still rare and elusive. In the present study we grew two wheat cultivars (HD2967 and Sonalika) in open top chambers (OTC) under ambient (AO) and elevated O<sub>3</sub> (EO) (ambient + 20 ppb O<sub>3</sub>) and provided two levels of N fertilization; (a) recommended nitrogen (RN), (b) 1.5 times the recommended N (HN). Growth (root/shoot ratio, leaf number and leaf area), biomass, gas-exchange (stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>), photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E), chlorophyll fluorescence (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>), physiological (chlorophyll and carotenoids), biochemical [antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation (MDA)] parameters and leaf N content were measured at the vegetative and reproductive phases. Yield attributes (spike weight plant<sup>-1</sup>, grain weight plant<sup>-1</sup>, grain numbers plant<sup>-1</sup>, husk weight plant<sup>-1</sup>, straw weight plant<sup>-1</sup>, 1000 grain weight, harvest index) and seed N content were analyzed at the final harvest stage. Grain yield plant<sup>-1</sup> was decreased in Sonalika under EO irrespective of different levels of N fertilization. Seed N content decreased by 3.9% and 5.6% in HD2967 and Sonalika, respectively, under EO at RN treatment. Antioxidant defense played an important role in protecting the plants against O<sub>3</sub> stress which was enhanced under HN treatment. Response of antioxidants varied between the cultivar, growth phase (at the vegetative or reproductive phase) and the N levels (RN or HN). Cultivar HD2967 was characterized by higher biomass, g<sub>s</sub> and stronger antioxidant protection system, while, Sonalika showed early senescence response (decreased leaf number plant<sup>-1</sup>, g<sub>s</sub>) and greater resources allocation towards eco-physiological parameters (increased A and F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) at the vegetative phase, resulting in the significant decrease in the yield attributes. Further study warrants the need to screen a large number of cultivars in relation to their response to various levels of N fertilization to minimize the yield losses under highly O<sub>3</sub> polluted areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
