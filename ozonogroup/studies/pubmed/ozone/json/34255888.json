Its antioxidation behaviors are started with the formation of diphenylamino radical (DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> ) by loss of hydrogen atom through reaction with oxygen or ozone. DPAH was oxidized by ozonation to produce DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> and DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> was directly detected using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). The influence of oxidation time on generation of DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> and consumption of DPAH was also investigated.", "Experiments were performed using a home-made ozone bubbling apparatus for oxidation of DPAH. DPAH solution (1000\u2009ppm) in acetone was stirred during the ozonation. The oxidized sample was diluted 100-fold and analyzed using APCI-MS. Structures and energies of DPAH, DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> and detected ions were obtained using electronic structure calculations with Spartan 10 and Gaussian 09.", "DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> was detected in positive APCI-MS in the form of DPAH<sup>\u2022+</sup> by proton transfer reaction with protonated acetone. Formation of DPAH<sup>\u2022+</sup> from DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> was more favorable than that of [DPAH\u2009+\u2009H]<sup>+</sup> from DPAH and it was also much more favorable than that of DPA<sup>+</sup> from DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> . By increasing the oxidation time, the relative abundance of DPAH<sup>\u2022+</sup> was increased whereas that of [DPAH\u2009+\u2009H]<sup>+</sup> was notably decreased.", "Existence of DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> was directly analyzed using APCI-MS. DPAH and DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> were differently detected as [DPAH\u2009+\u2009H]<sup>+</sup> and DPAH<sup>\u2022+</sup> , respectively. Direct APCI-MS analysis is a suitable technique for identification and quantitation of DPA<sup>\u2022</sup> ."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Sejong University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Chae Eun", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5844-024X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Sejong University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Sung-Seen", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Burton K.
