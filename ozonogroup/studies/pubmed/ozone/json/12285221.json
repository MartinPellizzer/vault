To achieve sustainable development, population cannot continue to grow (possible 3-fold increase during the 20th century) since it only burdens the earth and future generations with more and more pollution, waste, and resource depletion. Warning signs already exist: global warming, ozone depletion, vanishing species, and deforestations. Future projections for population growth highlight the problem of employment, unemployment, and underemployment, and underemployment in the US and even more so in developing countries where they are already of great concern. The US population is growing faster than any other developed nation. Yet many economists believe that population growth equated a healthy economy and environmental degradation is necessary for progress. The Workforce 2000 report prepared by conservative think tank contends that even though unemployment increases steadily, the US will soon face a shortage of workers. The report used misleading data and false assumptions, however. For example, it shows the work force growing at 1%/year in the 1990s compared with 3% in the 1970s, but the higher growth in the 1970s was due to the maturing of the baby boomers. Other economists note that in a stable population, fewer people compete for jobs which increases wages and thus the standard of living for most people. Communities can monitor local food, water, and energy supplies, jobs, and health care in a stable population. Company worries about labor shortages are really worries about shortages of cheap labor, consequently many companies are moving factories outside the US where they can employ cheap labor. An economist who favors self-reliance notes that the US population policy is to let population take its natural course, which is antiquated thinking."]}], "OtherID": ["072780", "00213003"], "PMID": "12285221", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "02"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0199-0071", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "24", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "ZPG reporter", "ISOAbbreviation": "ZPG Report"}, "ArticleTitle": "In the grips of growth.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "1", "EndPage": "4", "MedlinePgn": "1, 4"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sherman", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ZPG Report", "NlmUniqueID": "9878810", "ISSNLinking": "0199-0071"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developed Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Employment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy-Generating Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Workforce"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Unemployment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12285221"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
