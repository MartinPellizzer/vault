While photolysis of ONs is known to result in the release of NO<sub>2</sub> back to the atmosphere, the photolysis rate constants and mechanisms of monoterpene-derived ONs (MT-ONs) have not been well constrained. We investigated the gas-phase photolysis of three synthetic ONs derived from \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, and d-limonene through chamber experiments. The measured photolysis rate constants ranged from (0.55 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> to (2.3 \u00b1 0.80) \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> under chamber black lights. When extrapolated to solar spectral photon flux at a solar zenith angle of 28.14\u00b0 in summer, the photolysis rate constants were in the range of (4.1 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> to (14 \u00b1 6.7) \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (corresponding to lifetimes of 2.0 \u00b1 0.96 to 6.8 \u00b1 2.4 h) and (1.7 \u00b1 0.60) \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup> to (8.3 \u00b1 4.0) \u00d710<sup>-5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (3.3 \u00b1 1.6 to 17 \u00b1 6.0 h lifetimes) by using wavelength-dependent and average quantum yields, respectively. Photolysis mechanisms were proposed based on major products detected during photolysis. A zero-dimensional box model was further employed to simulate the photolysis of \u03b1-pinene-derived ON under ambient conditions. We found that more than 99% of \u03b1-pinene-derived ON can be converted to inorganic nitrogen within 12 h of irradiation and ozone was formed correspondingly. Together, these findings show that photolysis is an important atmospheric sink for MT-ONs and highlight their role in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> recycling and ozone chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2941-7235"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuchen", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9327-6748"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Takeuchi", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado80309-0216, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Chemical Sciences Laboratory (CSL), Boulder, Colorado80305, United States."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Siyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0891-0052"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, California92697, United States."}], "LastName": "Nizkorodov", "ForeName": "Sergey A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5998-6167"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}], "LastName": "France", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Eris", "ForeName": "Gamze", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8460-4765"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia30332, United States."}], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "Nga Lee", "Initials": "NL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36651914", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c04307"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
