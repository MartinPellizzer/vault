However, there is increasing evidence that this pollutant has physiological effects which interact with those of other environmental factors in ways which may be important in determining tree condition and growth. The effects of O<sub>3</sub> episodes and drought on O<sub>3</sub> uptake, gas exchange and water relations of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and P. sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. were investigated in two experiments. In the first a rapidly drying soil mixture was used, and seedlings of P. abies were exposed to short (2 h) daily episodes of O<sub>3</sub> at 80 nl 1<sup>-1</sup> on each day of a 5 d drought. Photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ) were significantly decreased (P= 0.01) by water deficit and as a consequence, uptake of O<sub>3</sub> by the plants was also significantly decreased. Exposure to O<sub>3</sub> did not affect A or g<sub>s</sub> for this species. In the second experiment a soil mixture designed to give a slower development of water deficit was used and 1 + 1 transplants of P. sitchensis were exposed to a single O<sub>3</sub> episode (up to 100 nl 1<sup>-1</sup> for 3 h) after water had been withheld for 7 or 14 d. Hofler diagrams showed that mild water deficits did not affect shoot water relations. However, O<sub>3</sub> significantly increased solute potential (\u03a8<sub>s</sub> ) after 7 d of drought, an effect which was lost after 14 d of drought. Flux of O<sub>3</sub> to the watered plants was greater than to the unwatered plants at all concentrations, the effect being more marked at higher concentrations. This effect was partly attributable to the greater stomatal conductances recorded for the well watered plants, but was also partly due to stomatal opening caused by O<sub>3</sub> , an effect which was diminished or reversed for unwatered plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forestry Commission Research Station, Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham, Surrey GU10 4LH."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dobson", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forestry Commission Research Station, Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham, Surrey GU10 4LH."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "Gail", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forestry Commission Research Station, Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham, Surrey GU10 4LH."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Freer-Smith", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Barnes, J.
