In this study, MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> was consciously synthesized by \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> doped with Ce<sup>3+</sup> (Ce:Mn = 1:10) and employed as the ozonation catalyst for quinoline degradation. After that, the removal efficiency and mechanism of quinoline were systematically analyzed by characterizing the physicochemical properties of MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, investigating free radicals and monitoring the solution pH. Results indicated that the removal rate of quinoline was greatly improved by the prepared MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> catalyst. Specifically, the removal efficiencies of quinoline could be 93.73, 62.57 and 43.76%, corresponding to MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> and single ozonation systems, respectively. The radical scavenging tests demonstrated that <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> were the dominant reactive oxygen species in the MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> ozonation system. Meanwhile, the contribution levels of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> to quinoline degradation were about 42 and 35%, respectively. The abundant surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies of the MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> catalyst were two important factors for decomposing molecular O<sub>3</sub> into more <sup>\u2022</sup>OH and <sup>\u2022</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. This study could provide scientific support for the application of the MnCe<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> system in degrading quinoline in bio-treated coking wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Science and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, Jiangsu, China E-mail: hslongrcees@cumt.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Science and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhaochang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Fangzheng Environmental Protection Consulting (Group) Co., Ltd, Xuzhou, 221132, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Science and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Sijie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5645-0295"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment Science and Spatial Informatics, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Shilong", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I5Y540LHVR", "NameOfSubstance": "Cocaine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coke"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cocaine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coke"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38358505", "10.2166/wst.2024.027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
