Topics addressed include characterization of exposure to traffic-related pollutants; the findings of epidemiological studies to date; and investigative approaches and the related challenges - including bias, model-based conclusions, and sample size issues--in characterizing the health effects of air pollution from traffic.

The evidence points to traffic as a threat to public health that will be managed with great difficulty; however, more research is needed to refine our understanding of the health consequences of traffic exposures and as a basis for formulating mitigation policies.
