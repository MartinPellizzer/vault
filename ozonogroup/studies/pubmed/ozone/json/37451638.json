In this study, a new Co, N co-doped carbon-based catalyst (Co-N-BC) was synthesized from ZIF-67 and biochar, which can significantly improve the degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in catalytic ozonation. The mineralization rate of 4-NP achieves 65.8% within 60\u00a0min. The catalyst showed high recycling stability in the four cycles of reuse experiment. Different operating parameters, such as solution pH, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> and 4-NP, have been studied in the Co-N-BC catalytic ozonation. O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u00b7 and \u00b7OH are determined as the main reactive species for 4-NP degradation, and \u00b7OH is especially responsibly for 4-NP mineralization. The existence of inorganic ions, such as Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, all significantly inhibited the degradation of 4-NP to different extend, respectively. The effect of substituent on a series of organics with similar structure of 4-NP was also investigated in Co-N-BC catalytic ozonation. This study provides a new composite material for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, which is very promising in 4-NP contained complex wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
