To further decrease PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and reduce days with severe air pollution, the government promulgated the \"Three-year (2018-2020) Action Plan for Cleaner Air\" (the Three-year Action Plan) in 2018. During the three-year Action Plan, a few studies reported a continuous decline in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, but it is unclear whether O<sub>3</sub> and its effects also increase with the decrease of PM<sub>2.5</sub> like during APPCAP. In this study, for the first time, we systematically assessed changes in ground-level O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and related ecological and health risks during the period of the Three-year Action Plan using nationwide O<sub>3</sub> measurements. The national MDA8, Exceedance, and SOMO35 indicators were reduced by 3.8%, 28.5%, and 12.6%, respectively, ecological risk indicators of M12, M7, SUM06, AOT40, and W126 were reduced by 5.4%, 5.6%, 19.5%, 15.4%, and 18.6%, respectively, from 2018 to 2020. Spatially, the greatest reduction in all the indicators except MDA8 occurred in Pearl River Delta, followed by Fen Wei Plains, while Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Yangtze River Delta presented relatively small reductions. Between 2018 and 2020, the production losses caused by O<sub>3</sub> for wheat and rice decreased by 21.4% and 17.6%, respectively. Long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> across China over 2020 was estimated to cause about 160,795 (95% CI: 81,515-312,983) for all-cause mortality, 107,128 (95% CI: 36,703-173,823) for cardiovascular mortality, and 34,444 (95% CI: 0-72,609) for respiratory mortality, indicating decreases of 9.93%, 9.86%, and 9.78%, respectively, compared to the year 2018. Taken together, our results provided the first direct evidence for China's efforts to control O<sub>3</sub> pollution in recent years."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
