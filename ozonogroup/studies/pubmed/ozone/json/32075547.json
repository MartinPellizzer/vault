After the recent reconstruction of the plant, special attention was devoted to the effects of ozone dose and granulated activated carbon (GAC) filtration on the formation and behaviour of oxidation by-products (carbonyl compounds and bromate), as well as carbonaceous and nitrogenous chlorination by-products. For the oxidation of aromatic NOM moieties that absorb light at UV<sub>254</sub>, a lower ozone dose (1.0\u2005g O<sub>3</sub>/m<sup>3</sup>) is sufficient, whereas to achieve a measurable reduction (about 20%) of total organic carbon, an ozone dose of 1.5\u2005g O<sub>3</sub>/m<sup>3</sup> is required. The content of carbonyl compounds in the water after ozonation increases relative to the content before oxidation treatment, and is up to 12 times higher in the case of aldehydes and up to 2 times higher in the case of carboxylic acids. Seasonal variations, including changes in temperature and the amount of precipitation, were also shown to affect the content of organic matter in the raw water, with slight effects on the quality of the treated water. In the winter, the organic matter content is slightly higher, meaning their transformation products aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are also higher during the winter than the summer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PUC Water and Sewerage Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "Popov", "ForeName": "Mladen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Environmental Protection, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "Kragulj Isakovski", "ForeName": "Marijana", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Environmental Protection, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "Molnar Jazi\u0107", "ForeName": "Jelena", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Environmental Protection, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "Tubi\u0107", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Environmental Protection, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "Watson", "ForeName": "Malcolm", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Technology, Department of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "\u0160\u0107iban", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Environmental Protection, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia."}], "LastName": "Agbaba", "ForeName": "Jasmina", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32075547", "10.1080/09593330.2020.1732474"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
