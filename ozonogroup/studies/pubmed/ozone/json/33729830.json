Numerous treatments have been reported in the literature on the degradation of DON in food products. These treatments include thermal, chemical, biological/enzymatic, irradiation, light, ultrasound, ozone, and atmospheric cold plasma treatments. Each of these methods has different degradation efficacy and degrades DON by a distinct mechanism, which leads to various degradation byproducts with different toxicity. This manuscript focuses to review the degradation of DON by the aforementioned treatments, the chemical structure and toxicity of the byproducts, and the degradation pathway of DON. Based on the type of treatment, DON can be degraded to norDONs A-F, DON lactones, and ozonolysis products or transformed into de-epoxy deoxynivalenol, DON-3-glucoside, 3-acetyl-DON, 7-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, 3-keto-DON, or 3-epi-DON. DON is a major problem for the grain industry and the studies focusing on DON degradation mechanisms could be helpful to select the best method and overcome the DON contamination in grains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4523-6784"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural, Food & Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada."}], "LastName": "Feizollahi", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3008-915X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural, Food & Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada."}], "LastName": "Roopesh", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichothecenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JT37HYP23V", "NameOfSubstance": "deoxynivalenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trichothecenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "18"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33729830", "10.1080/10408398.2021.1895056"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
