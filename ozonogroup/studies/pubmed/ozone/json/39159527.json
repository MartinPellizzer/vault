Limited studies have attempted to explore these associations in low-polluted areas. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and preterm birth in Sweden.", "In this population-based study we included preterm births between 2014 and 2019 from the Swedish Pregnancy Register. We applied a spatiotemporal model to estimate daily levels of particulate matter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), PM\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2),</sub> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at the residential address of each participant. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (OR) of preterm birth per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) increase in air pollution exposure at 0-6-day lag. Two-pollutant models were applied to evaluate the independent association of each exposure on preterm birth. We also stratified by maternal characteristics to identify potential effect modifiers.", "28,216 (4.5%) preterm births were included. An increase in O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with increased odds of preterm birth [OR\u00a0=\u00a01.06 per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (95% CI, 1.02; 1.10]. PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were not significantly associated with preterm birth, and NO<sub>2</sub> displayed a negative nonlinear association with preterm birth. We did not observe any notable effect modification, but we found suggestive larger associations between O<sub>3</sub> and preterm birth when stratifying by male sex, spontaneous delivery, and spring season.", "Increased O<sub>3</sub> exposure one week before delivery was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth in Sweden, a country with levels of air pollution below the current World Health Organization air quality guidelines.
