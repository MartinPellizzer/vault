A critical review of BOM (occurrence and oxidant effects) and rapid-rate biofiltration performance (preozonation, backwashing with an oxidant, empty bed contact time (EBCT) and temperature) was carried out. An extensive literature data analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) found total organic carbon (TOC) in nonozonated water is comprised of 20% (median) biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC) and 3% (median) assimilable organic carbon (AOC). For ozonated waters (n\u00a0=\u00a0103), these values increased to 30% (median) BDOC and 9% (median) AOC. For all operation conditions (n\u00a0=\u00a0117), biofilters (12\u00a0min average EBCT) removed 12% (median) of the influent TOC with higher removals for ozonated waters, 15% (median), compared to nonozonated waters, 10% (median). As temperature increased from \u226410\u00a0\u00b0C to \u226520\u00a0\u00b0C, TOC removal increased from 10% to 17% (median). This review demonstrates biofiltration can be an efficient treatment technology to remove a portion of the BOM from the filter influent and should be optimized to achieve maximum removal."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
