In this study the kinetics and mechanisms of MC-LR elimination from drinking water under solar irradiation with free chlorine (the solar/chlorine process) was evaluated. The rate of MC-LR degradation was dramatically enhanced in the solar/chlorine process (1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) compared with chlorination alone (2.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) or solar irradiation alone (1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with a free chlorine dose of 42\u202f\u03bcM (3.0\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> as Cl<sub>2</sub>). The enhancement was due to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, reactive chlorine species (RCS), and ozone during free chlorine photolysis. The second-order rate constants of Cl <sup>\u2022</sup> and Cl<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup> reacting with MC-LR were determined to be (2.25\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07)\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>10</sup> and (5.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42)\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>7</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Cl <sup>\u2022</sup> was the major RCS contributing to MC-LR elimination. The highest MC-LR degradation rate was observed at pH 8.0. Free chlorine, HO <sup>\u2022</sup>, Cl <sup>\u2022</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> together accounted for almost 95% of the MC-LR elimination. Hydroxyl- and chloro-MC-LR were generated in the process, followed by dechlorination, dehydration and cleavage of cyclic structures in MC-LR. Aldehyde- and ketone-MC-LR byproducts were also observed. The destruction of dienes led to a great reduction in MC-LR's toxicity. MC-LR removal in natural water samples under natural sunlight irradiation with free chlorine was demonstrated with limited formation of disinfection byproducts. The solar/chlorine process is an energy-efficient approach for MC-LR control, especially suitable for rural areas or where algal blooming threatens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
