The network of channels and chambers of the mili-photoreactor was coated with a TiO<sub>2</sub>-P25 thin film, resulting in a catalyst coated surface per reactor volume of 990\u202fm<sup>2</sup>\u202fm<sup>-3</sup>. Ozone and n-decane streams were fed to alternate chambers of the mili-photoreactor, promoting a good contact between O<sub>3</sub>/n-decane/catalyst. Initially, direct reaction between n-decane and ozone (ozonation) was assessed for different O<sub>3</sub>/n-decane (O<sub>3</sub>/dec) feed molar ratios and total feed flow rates. Under the best conditions, ozonation process achieved total n-decane conversion (below the limit of detection), yielding a reaction rate (r<sub>dec</sub>) of 6.8\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fmin<sup>-1</sup> or 6.7\u202fmmol\u202fm<sup>-3</sup><sub>reactor</sub> s<sup>-1</sup>. However, the low reactivity of ozone with the degradation by-products resulted in a quite poor mineralization (~10%). For the O<sub>3</sub>/UVC system, an increase on relative humidity from 7 to 40% slight improved the n-decane oxidation rate, mainly associated with the generation of HO from the reaction of active oxygen radicals (O) and water molecules. A strong synergistic effect was observed when coupling TiO<sub>2</sub>/UVA photocatalysis with ozonation (O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>/UVA), enhancing substantially the mineralization of n-decane molecules up to 100% under O<sub>3</sub>/dec feed molar ratio of 15, photonic flux of 2.67\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03\u202fJ\u202fs<sup>-1</sup> and a residence time of 2.0\u202fs. Different reaction intermediates were detected for O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>/UVA and O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>/UVA oxidative systems, indicating the participation of different oxidant species (O<sub>3</sub>, HO, O, etc.)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
