Nevertheless, H<sub>2</sub> does not contribute to pollutant degradation and yet increases energy consumption. Inspired by fuel cell technology, in which the O<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed on the cathode, herein, a carbon nanotube-coated carbon-PTFE gas diffusion electrode was fabricated to catalyze ORR during EO for the treatment of leachate concentrates. In comparison to conventional HER-EO, ORR-EO was shown to save 17.7-23.2% energy consumption. Further, as the cathodic ORR byproduct, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can react with the ozone generated from the Ti/SnO<sub>2</sub>-Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> anode to catalyze the peroxone process, which enhances OH generation for the degradation of organic products. This in situ electro-peroxone process was determined by salicylic acid OH trapping and liquid chromatography. The novel simultaneous EO and in situ electro-peroxone process described herein has great application potential and economic merit in the degradation of refractory organics in wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
