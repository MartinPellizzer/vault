Aiming to detect O<sub>3</sub> concentration and develop efficient O<sub>3</sub> sensing materials, sensing behavior of heterogenous cation (Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Sn<sup>4+</sup> and Sb<sup>5+</sup>) doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanostructures was investigated. The incorporation of these cations modulated the electronic structure of semiconductor oxides, affecting the density of chemisorbed oxygen species and reactive sites. From O<sub>3</sub> sensing results, Fe<sup>3+</sup> doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> based sensors featuring saturated resistance curves in O<sub>3</sub> gas, demonstrated fast sensing speed and qualified detection threshold (20 ppb). In contrast, Sn<sup>4+</sup> and Sb<sup>5+</sup> doped counterparts exhibited non-saturated sensing curves, resulting in slower response/recovery speed. As a proof-of-concept, these optimized sensors were integrated as the sensor array. Coupled to the image recognition technique, this sensor array could successfully discriminate O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. That is, through the tailored combination of material modulation and sensor array, this study paves a novel approach for highly sensitive and selective O<sub>3</sub> detection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
