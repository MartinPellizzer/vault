To fill this gap, we measured gas-phase carboxylic acids in real-time inside and outside of a university classroom using a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HRToF-CIMS) equipped with an acetate ion source. A wide variety of carboxylic acids were identified indoors and outdoors, including monoacids, diacids, hydroxy acids, carbonyl acids, and aromatic acids. An empirical parametrization was derived to estimate the sensitivity (ion counts per ppt of the analytes) of the HRToF-CIMS to the acids. The campaign-average concentration of carboxylic acids measured outdoors was 1.0 ppb, with the peak concentration occurring in daytime. The average indoor concentration of carboxylic acids was 6.8 ppb, of which 87% was contributed by formic and lactic acid. While carboxylic acids measured outdoors displayed a single daytime peak, those measured indoors displayed a daytime and a nighttime peak. Besides indoor sources such as off-gassing of building materials, evidence for acid production from indoor chemical reactions with ozone was found. In addition, some carboxylic acids measured indoors correlated to CO<sub>2</sub> in daytime, suggesting that human occupants may contribute to their abundance either through direct emissions or surface reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Shang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Samantha L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0731-1202"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aerodyne Research Inc. , Billerica, Massachusetts 01821, United States."}], "LastName": "Stark", "ForeName": "Harald", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7419-0044"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Ziemann", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6203-1847"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado , Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Jimenez", "ForeName": "Jose L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Universities"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28420232", "10.1021/acs.est.7b01358"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
