We aimed to examine the impacts of ambient air pollutants on cardiac ventricular repolarization in a highly polluted urban region.", "Seventy-three healthy non-smoking young adults (66% female, mean age of 23.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.4 years) were followed with four repeated 24-h electrocardiogram recordings in 2014-2016 in Beijing, China. Continuous concentrations of ambient particulates in size fractions of 5-560\u202fnm diameter, black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were measured at a fixed-location air pollution monitoring station. Generalized linear mixed models, with adjustment for individual risk factors, time-varying factors and meteorological parameters, were used to evaluate the effects of air pollution on 5-min segments of heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc), an index of cardiac ventricular repolarization.", "During the study period, the mean levels of number concentrations of particulates in size range of 5-560\u202fnm (PNC<sub>5-560</sub>) were 20,711 particles/cm<sup>3</sup>. Significant increases in QTc of 0.56% (95% CI: 0.27, 0.84) to 1.76% (95% CI: 0.73, 2.79) were associated with interquartile range increases in PNC<sub>50-560</sub> at prior 1-5\u202fmoving average days. Significant increases in QTc were also associated with increases in exposures to traffic-related air pollutants (BC, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO), a combustion pollutant SO<sub>2</sub>, and the secondary pollutant O<sub>3</sub>. The associations were stronger in participants who were male, overweight, with abdominal obesity, and with higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.", "Our findings suggest that exposures to higher levels of ambient particulates in small size fractions and traffic pollutants were associated with cardiac repolarization abnormalities in healthy adults, and the cardio-metabolic risks may modify the adverse cardiac effects attributable to air pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
