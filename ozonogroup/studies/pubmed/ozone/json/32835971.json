Their simultaneous removal performances under non-thermal plasma (NTP) and NTP-catalysis were carried out and compared by a single stage coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. The effects of VOCs mixture, humidity, materials filling in the discharge zoon on the removal efficiency, CO<sub>x</sub> selectivity, byproducts types and their emission levels were deeply investigated to explore the degradation mechanism and coexistence effect. Experimental results showed that the toluene removal was significantly inhibited when treated together with styrene under plasma treatment. But that of styrene was hardly affected at the same conditions. It was found that benzaldehyde as the primary organic byproducts from styrene consumed the oxidizing particles (O and <sup>.</sup> OH), limiting the conversion of toluene. The introduction of Cu-doped MnO<sub>2</sub> materials significantly improved the VOCs removal performance with nearly 100% conversion to CO<sub>x</sub> at a discharge power less than 30\u00a0W, as well as O<sub>3</sub> generation from more than 1.2\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> by NTP to 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-3</sup>\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> by NTP-catalysis. With the help of in situ FT-IR, it was believed that catalysts not only accelerated the adsorption and degradation of pollutants but also utilized ozone to involve this process. At last, a plausible explanation on binary coexistence effect under different conditions had been suggested and discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
