We aimed to (1) further confirm the independent associations of PA and air pollution; (2) examine whether PA would attenuate the positive associations of air pollutants with MetS. We included 13,418 adults above 45 years old in this study. We defined MetS according to the Joint Interim Societies. The concentration of air pollutants (including fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), inhalable particles (PM<sub>10</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO)) were estimated by ground-based measurements and satellite remote sensing products. We assessed the level of PA by metabolic equivalent (MET)-hour/week by summing the MET of all activities. We applied logistic regression models with sampling weight to explore the independent and joint associations of PA and air pollutants on MetS. Interaction plots were conducted to exhibit estimates of air pollutants on MetS as a function of PA. We found that all air pollutants were positively associated with the odds of MetS, while PA showed beneficial associations with MetS. The associations of air pollution on MetS decreased accompanied the increase of PA, while the detrimental effects between air pollutants and MetS did not be reversed by PA. In conclusion, PA may attenuate the associations of air pollutants with MetS, although in polluted areas, suggesting that keeping PA might be an effective way to reduce the adverse effects of air pollution with MetS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
