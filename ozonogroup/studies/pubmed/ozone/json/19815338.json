Results obtained in static regime show that the presence of activated carbon (GAC) during tinidazole ozonation: (i) increases its removal rate, (ii) reduces oxidation by-product toxicity, and (iii) reduces the concentration of dissolved organic matter. Study of the ozone/activated carbon system in dynamic regime showed that ozonation of tinidazole before the adsorption process considerably improves column performance, increasing the volume of water treated. It was observed that the efficacy of the treatment considerably increased with a shorter contact time between TNZ and O(3) streams before entering the column allowing a much higher volume of TNZ solution to be treated compared with the use of activated carbon alone, and reducing by 75% the amount of activated carbon required per unit of treated water volume. TNZ removal by the O(3)/GAC system is lower in natural waters and especially in wastewaters, than in ultrapure water. The toxicity results obtained during TNZ treatment with O(3)/GAC system showed that toxicity was directly proportional to the concentration of TNZ in the effluent, verifying that oxidation of the organic matter in the natural waters did not increase the toxicity of the system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain. jrivera@ugr.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivera-Utrilla", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Polo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prados-Joya", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferro-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bautista-Toledo", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "033KF7V46H", "NameOfSubstance": "Tinidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Tinidazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19815338", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.09.059", "S0304-3894(09)01520-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
