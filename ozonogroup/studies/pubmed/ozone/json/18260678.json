In this study, the normal impact of water droplets on solid substrates was investigated experimentally. The size of water droplets studied here was 46 microm and was much smaller than the most of the previous studies on drop impact. The Weber number (We) and Reynolds number (Re) were 0.05-2 and 10-100, respectively, and the Ohnesorge number was fixed at 0.017. The wettability of the solid substrate was varied by adsorbing a self-assembled monolayer of octadecyltrichlorosilane followed by the exposure to UV-ozone plasma. The impact scenarios for low We impacts were found to be qualitatively different from the high to moderate We impacts. Neither the development of a thin film and lamella under the traveling sphere nor the entrapment of small bubbles was observed. The dynamics of droplet impact at the conditions studied here is found to proceed under the combined influences of inertia, surface tension, and viscosity without being dominated by one specific mechanism. The maximum spreading factor (beta), the ratio of the diameter of the wetted surface and the drop diameter before impact, was correlated well with the relationship ln beta=0.090 ln We/(fs-cos theta)+0.151 for three decades of We/(fs-cos theta), where theta is the equilibrium contact angle, and fs is the ratio between the surface areas contacting the air and the solid substrate. The result implies that the final shape of the droplet is determined by the surface phenomenon rather than fluid mechanical effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Korea University, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-ku, Seoul 136-713, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Yangsoo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Chongyoup", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Doo Ho", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Dong June", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "112-04-9", "NameOfSubstance": "octadecyltrichlorosilane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z4152N8IUI", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wettability"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18260678", "10.1021/la702504v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
