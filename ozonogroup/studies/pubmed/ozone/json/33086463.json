While abundant data on individual advanced treatment technologies is available, there is limited knowledge regarding the removal performance of ozonation combined with multiple post-treatments and stand-alone membrane bioreactors. This is especially true for the removal of in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo toxicity. Therefore, we investigated the removal of 40 micropollutants and toxicity by a pilot-scale ozonation with four post-treatments: non-aerated and aerated granular activated carbon and biological filtration. In addition, two stand-alone membrane bioreactors fed with untreated wastewater and one MBR operating with ozonated partial flow recirculation were analysed. Aqueous and extracted samples were analysed in\u00a0vitro for (anti)estrogenic, (anti)androgenic and mutagenic effects. To assess in\u00a0vivo effects, the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum was exposed in an on-site flow-through system. Multiple in\u00a0vitro effects were detected in conventionally treated wastewater including estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Ozonation largely removed these effects, while anti-estrogenic and mutagenic effects increased suggesting the formation of toxic transformation products. These effects were significantly reduced by granular activated carbon being more effective than biological filtration. The membrane bioreactor performed similarly to the conventional treatment while the membrane bioreactor with ozonation had a comparable removal performance like ozonation. Conventionally treated wastewater increased the growth of P.\u00a0antipodarum. Ozonation reduced the reproduction indicating a potential formation of toxic transformation products. In the post-treatments, these effects were compensated or remained unaffected. The effluents of the membrane bioreactors induced reproductive toxicity. Our results show that ozonation is effective in further reducing toxicity and micropollutant concentrations. However, the formation of toxicity requires a post-treatment. Here, ozonation coupled to granular activated carbon filtration seemed the most promising treatment process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
