X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that iron and titanium successfully doped into the skeleton of \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, uniform distribution, maintain the ordered mesoporous structure of \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with larger specific surface area. The valence of titanium coexists with Ti<sup>4+</sup> and Ti<sup>3+</sup>, and the valence of iron was Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Infrared spectra of chemisorbed pyridine (Py-FTIR) results showed that the doped titanium and iron into the framework position of \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> altered the surface acidity of the alumina surface, especially increasing the medium Lewis acid sites, which was conducive to the effective decomposition of ozone into active oxygen species. The \u03b3-Fe-Ti-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst (Al/Fe\u2009=\u200925, Al/Ti\u2009=\u200975) enhanced the removal rate of ibuprofen in ozonation of bromide-containing water, and effectively blocked the formation of bromate. After the reaction of 60 min, the removal rate of TOC was increased from 54% of \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> to 86% with \u03b3-Fe-Ti-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>, while the ozonation alone was only 13%. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra showed that hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were reactive oxygen species, which was beneficial to the mineralization of organic matter. The capture experiment of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion confirmed that the electronic cycle of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion and Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion was beneficial to block the formation of bromated. The addition of ibuprofen and humic acid can enhance the reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the catalytic ozonation of \u03b3-Fe-Ti-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which further strengthened the blocking of bromate formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3160-0765"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Liqiang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine Resources Development Institute of Jiangsu, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Bing", "ForeName": "Jishuai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hecheng", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["34499019", "10.1080/21622515.2021.1937333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
