Additionally, the effects of different mammary irrigation regimen fluids such as ozone water and normal saline were compared. Dairy cattle clinically diagnosed with acute coliform mastitis (n = 57) were enrolled in the study, randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, and received the following treatments: systemic antibiotic administration (SAA group; n = 40), mammary irrigation regimen (MIR group; n = 10), and both treatments (MIX group; n=7). Significant antipyretic effects, as assessed by rectal temperature measurement, were observed in the MIX and MIR groups. Although 2 irrigating fluids were used, namely, ozone water and normal saline, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups. Fourteen days after the onset of the treatments, the milk yield recovery rate in MIR group tended to be higher (p = 0.06) than that in the SAA group. Additionally, after 30 days of treatment, the MIR group cows demonstrated significantly higher successful recovery rates (p<0.05) than the SAA group cows. These results indicate that mammary irrigation with normal saline is an effective treatment for acute coliform mastitis in dairy cattle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Veterinary Surgery, United Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan. shino@urban.ne.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shinozuka", "ForeName": "Yasunori", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirata", "ForeName": "Harumi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishibashi", "ForeName": "Ichiro", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okawa", "ForeName": "Yuzo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kasuga", "ForeName": "Asako", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takagi", "ForeName": "Mitsuhiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taura", "ForeName": "Yasuho", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Vet Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9105360", "ISSNLinking": "0916-7250"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dairying"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mastitis, Bovine"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutic Irrigation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19346692", "10.1292/jvms.71.269", "JST.JSTAGE/jvms/71.269"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
