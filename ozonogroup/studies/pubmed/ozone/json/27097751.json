Importantly, children and older persons are considered at-risk populations for O3-induced dysfunction, yet the mechanisms accounting for the age-related pulmonary responses to O3 are uncertain. In this study, we examined age-related susceptibility to O3 using 1\u2009mo (adolescent), 4\u2009mo (young adult), 12\u2009mo (adult) and 24\u2009mo (senescent) male Brown Norway rats exposed to filtered air or O3 (0.25 and 1.00\u2009ppm), 6\u2009h/day, two days/week for 1 week (acute) or 13 weeks (subchronic). Ventilatory function, assessed by whole-body plethysmography, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) biomarkers of injury and inflammation were used to examine O3-induced pulmonary effects. Relaxation time declined in all ages following the weekly exposures; however, this effect persisted only in the 24\u2009mo rats following a five days recovery, demonstrating an inability to induce adaptation commonly seen with repeated O3 exposures. PenH was increased in all groups with an augmented response in the 4\u2009mo rats following the subchronic O3 exposures. O3 led to increased breathing frequency and minute volume in the 1 and 4\u2009mo animals. Markers of pulmonary permeability were increased in all age groups. Elevations in BALF \u03b3-glutamyl transferase activity and lung inflammation following an acute O3 exposure were noted in only the 1 and 4\u2009mo rats, which likely received an increased effective O3 dose. These data demonstrate that adolescent and young adult animals are more susceptible to changes in ventilation and pulmonary injury/inflammation caused by acute and episodic O3 exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division and NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Snow", "ForeName": "Samantha J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division, NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division and NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Environmental Sciences and Engineering, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hil , Chapel Hill , NC , USA."}], "LastName": "Bass", "ForeName": "Virginia L", "Initials": "VL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division and NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Schladweiler", "ForeName": "Mette C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division and NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "Allen D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division, NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Jarema", "ForeName": "Kimberly A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division, NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Pamela M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Toxicity Assessment Division, NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Johnstone", "ForeName": "Andrew F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Environmental Public Health Division and NHEERL, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "Urmila P", "Initials": "UP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.2.2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography, Whole Body"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred BN"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27097751", "10.3109/08958378.2016.1170910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
