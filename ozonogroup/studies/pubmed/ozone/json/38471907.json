The results showed that\uff1a \u2460 the three indicators \uff3bi.e.\uff0c O<sub>3</sub> formation potential \uff08OFP\uff09\uff0c \u00b7OH reaction rate \uff08<i>k</i><sub>\u00b7OH</sub>\uff09\uff0c and relative incremental reactivity \uff08RIR\uff09\uff3d jointly indicated that alkenes\uff0c oxygenated volatile organic compounds \uff08OVOCs\uff09\uff0c and aromatics were the highest contributors among anthropogenic volatile organic compounds \uff08AVOC\uff09 to O<sub>3</sub> formation\uff0c and the contribution of biogenic volatile organic compounds \uff08BVOC\uff09 also could not be ignored. Additionally\uff0c the results based on RIR calculation implied that that the acetaldehyde\uff0c ethylene\uff0c and propylene were the most sensitive individual VOCs species in Yining City. \u2461 The in-situ photochemical O<sub>3</sub> variations were primarily influenced by the local photochemical production and export process horizontally to downwind areas or vertically to the upper layer\uff0c and the reaction pathways of HO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7+ NO and \u00b7OH + NO<sub>2</sub> contributed the most to the gross O<i><sub>x</sub></i> photochemical production \uff0860%\uff09 and photochemical destruction production \uff0853%\uff09\uff0c respectively. Hence\uff0c the reduction in local emissions for O<sub>3</sub> precursors was more essential to alleviate O<sub>3</sub> pollution in this city. \u2462 The outcome based on RIR\uff08NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>\uff09 / RIR\uff08AVOC\uff09 and EKMA jointly suggested that the photochemical regime in this city can be considered a transitional regime that was also nearly a VOCs-limited regime. Detailed mechanism modeling based on multiple scenarios further suggested that the NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and VOCs synergic emission reduction strategies was helpful to alleviate O<sub>3</sub> pollution. These results are useful to provide policy-related guidance for other cities facing similar O<sub>3</sub> pollution in northwest China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin 300384, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecological Environment Monitoring Centre of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li-Ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecological Environment Monitoring Centre of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin-Qi", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Zhen-Sen", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Cun-Mei", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science & Safety Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin 300384, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471907", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202302191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
