We present a clinical case of a 79-year-old female patient who had a clinical manifestation of headache on the occipital side of the head with irradiation to the shoulder girdle as well as numbness, dizziness, visual impairment, sleep disturbances, and tingling in the hands for three months. Vertigo and rightward staggering had been experienced for two weeks. On physical examination, it was discovered that there was smoothed physiological lordosis, restricted and painful movements, and paravertebral muscle rigidity in the cervical region. The patient had bilaterally reduced biceps and triceps reflexes, painful Erb's points, and hypesthesia over the C5 and C6 dermatomes on the right side. The patient had decreased coordination and displayed staggered movement to the right. A CT scan discovered dilated subarachnoid spaces of the convexity and a CV cyst. The patient was prescribed conservative therapy consisting of etoricoxib oral at a dosage of 2 \u00d7 60 mg for seven days, tolperisone hydrochloride orally at a dosage of 2 \u00d7 150 mg for seven days, pregabalin 75 mg, one pill in the evening for seven days, ozoid (a gel containing ozone) for external application, and vinpocetine 2 \u00d7 10 mg orally for two months. Following the conservative treatment, the patient exhibited improvement in her symptoms and no longer had challenges carrying out her daily tasks. Furthermore, six months after the therapy, the patient did not experience any symptoms. Long-term follow-up will be conducted in cases of symptom recurrence or cyst enlargement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Penchev et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, BGR."}], "LastName": "Penchev", "ForeName": "Plamen", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, BGR."}], "LastName": "Petrov", "ForeName": "Petar-Preslav", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, BGR."}], "LastName": "Velchev", "ForeName": "Vladislav", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Military Medical Academy Hisarya, Hisarya, BGR."}], "LastName": "Velev", "ForeName": "Andrey", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Cavum septum pellucidum and vergae cyst: a symptomatic case with intracranial hypertension and multiple nerve involvement.
