The increase of solar UV radiation flux over Antarctica due to stratospheric ozone depletion creates the optimal conditions for photochemical reactions on the snow. Modeling, laboratory, and indirect field studies suggest that snowpack process release gases to the atmosphere that can react on sea salt particles in remote regions such as Antarctica, modifying aerosol composition and physical properties of aerosols. Here, we present evidence of photochemical processing in West Antarctica aerosols using microscopic and chemical speciation of individual atmospheric particles. Individual aerosol particles collected at the Brazilian module Criosfera 1 were analyzed by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS) combined with computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis. The displacement of chlorine relative to sodium was observed over most of the sea salt particles. Particles with a chemical composition consistent with NaCl-NO<sub>3</sub> contributed up to 30% of atmospheric particles investigated. Overall, this study provides evidence that the snowpack and particulate nitrate photolysis should be considered in dynamic partition equilibrium in the troposphere. These findings may assist in reducing modeling uncertainties and present new insights into the aerosol chemical composition in the polar environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
