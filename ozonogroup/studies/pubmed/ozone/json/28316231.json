When interactions between these two species occurred at the surface of the solid powder, an obvious CL effect was obtained. This performance could be attributed to the evolution of a ROOOH intermediate, which subsequently released emissive <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> species. This is the first report analyzing the gas-solid phase CL performance of O<sub>3</sub> with alcohols, phenols, and saccharides. It is believed that this strategy can be extended to applications in other gas-solid phase CL analyses utilizing the O<sub>3</sub> system. This has also created a novel area of gas-solid CL performance; thus, relevant processes and mechanisms can be deduced and identified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Beijing Key Laboratory of Microanalytical Methods and Instrumentation, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7625-1541"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Dingkun", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Beijing Key Laboratory of Microanalytical Methods and Instrumentation, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yongzan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Beijing Key Laboratory of Microanalytical Methods and Instrumentation, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Xiangnan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Beijing Key Laboratory of Microanalytical Methods and Instrumentation, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Haifeng", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Beijing Key Laboratory of Microanalytical Methods and Instrumentation, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Syed Niaz Ali", "Initials": "SNA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Beijing Key Laboratory of Microanalytical Methods and Instrumentation, Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Jin-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28316231", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b00481"]}}]}
