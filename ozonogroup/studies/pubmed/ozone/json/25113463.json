E-O3 accelerated leaf senescence, as indicated by significant decreases in photosynthetic pigment contents with the elongation of O3 exposure. E-O3 significantly affected gas exchange and carboxylation, inducing reductions in light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat), the maximum activity of Rubisco (Vc,max) and the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax). Chl a/b, Vc,max/Jmax and stomatal limitation (l) were not affected. Stomatal conductance (gs) was significantly decreased by E-O3 in the first year, but remained unchanged in the second year. It can be inferred that the decrease in Asat by E-O3 was mainly attributed to the changes in non-stomatal factors. After two years' exposure, E-O3 caused significant decreases in canopy photosynthesis and leaf mass per area, and a significant increase in the number of branches, but induced slight, not significant decreases in growth and biomass. Therefore, it can be concluded that the carbon accumulation of the species M. glyptostroboides could be negatively affected after long-term exposure to high O3 concentration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
