Here, we analyze tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), formaldehyde (HCHO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) to assess other measures of air quality across South Asia from 2008 to 2018. The IASI-Forli retrieved tropospheric ozone data was validated with ozonesonde, reanalysis (ERA5), satellite (TES), and model simulation products (GEOS-Chem and TOMCAT/SLIMCAT). Space-based observations of these three trace gases were used to conduct a spatio temporal analysis over South Asia using trend analysis (Theil-Sen and linear regression), change-point detection (Pettitt's test), and hotspot identification (Getis-Ord G<sub>i</sub>*). We used the formaldehyde-nitrogen dioxide ratio (FNR) to identify NO<sub>x</sub> limited, VOC limited, and transitional regimes in South Asia. Counter to previous studies, a statistically significant decrease of HCHO (-0.0041 DU yr<sup>-1</sup>) and O<sub>3</sub> (-0.064 DU yr<sup>-1</sup>) was detected for South Asia; however, NO<sub>2</sub> is increasing the 0.001 DU yr<sup>-1</sup> over South Asia during 2008-18. The Indo-Gangetic Plains emerged as being critically affected by the three trace gases. Certain parts of southern and south-eastern India are gradually emerging as NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO hotpots. No significant O<sub>3</sub> hotspots were discernible, though coldspots existed along the Himalaya belt of India, Nepal, and Bhutan and mountainous tracts of Pakistan. FNR indicates the reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> in NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime of the Indo-Gangetic Plains reduced the formation of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> over South Asia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
