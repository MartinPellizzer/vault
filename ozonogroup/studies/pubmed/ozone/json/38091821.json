This study used the long-term trends of air pollutants to discuss the achievements and challenges in further improving air quality in China. The Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter and multiple-linear regression (MLR) were used to quantify the meteorology-related and emission-related trends of air pollutants from 2014 to 2022 in China. The KZ filter analysis showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased by 7.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.92%\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup>, while daily maximum 8-h ozone (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) showed an increasing trend with 3.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.89%\u00a0yr<sup>-1</sup> in China. The decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and increase in MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> were primarily attributed to changes in emission, with the relative contribution of 85.8% and 86.0%, respectively. Meteorology variations, including increased ambient temperature, boundary layer height, and reduced relative humidity, also contributed to the reduction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the enhancement of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>. The emission-related trends of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> exhibited continuous decrease and increase, respectively, from 2014 to 2022, while the variation rates slowed during 2018-2020 compared to that during 2014-2017, highlighting the challenges in further improving air quality, particularly in simultaneously reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. This study recommends reducing NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from the agriculture sector in rural areas and transport emissions in urban areas to further decrease PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels. Addressing O<sub>3</sub> pollution requires the reduction of O<sub>3</sub> precursor gases based on site-specific atmospheric chemistry considerations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
