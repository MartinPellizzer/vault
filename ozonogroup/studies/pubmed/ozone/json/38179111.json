We included 3,703 non-Hispanic Black and 5,475 non-Hispanic white gravidae who were U.S.-born, delivered from August 2011-December 2020, and resided in Harris County, TX. We used data from the U.S. EPA EJScreen to characterize the EJ burden of participant's zip code of residence from fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), ozone, and proximity to National Priorities List (NPL) sites and calculated zip-code level Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We assessed the contribution of neighborhood-level variables to the Black-White disparity in sPTB by evaluating attenuation of the odds ratio (OR) representing the effect of race in multivariable logistic regression models, controlling for individual-level characteristics. We also conducted race-stratified analyses between each neighborhood variable and sPTB. Exposure indices were treated as continuous variables; in stratified models, ORs and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) are presented per 10-unit increase in the neighborhood variable.", "Accounting for individual-level variables, Black gravidae had 79% higher odds of sPTB than white gravidae (OR\u2009=\u20091.79, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.32, 2.44); the disparity was moderately attenuated when accounting for EJ burden or ADI (ORs ranged from 1.58 to 1.69). Though we observed no association between any of the EJ burden indices and sPTB among white gravidae, we found increased risks among Black gravidae, with ORs of similar magnitude for each EJ variable. For example, Black gravidae experienced 17% increased odds of sPTB associated with a 10-unit increase in the EJ burden index for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (OR\u2009=\u20091.17, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.97, 1.40). No racial differences were observed in the association of ADI with sPTB.", "Though we observed limited evidence of the contribution of living in EJ neighborhoods to the Black-White disparity in sPTB, our study suggests living in an EJ neighborhood may differentially impact Black and white gravidae."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Whitworth, Moussa, Salihu, Chardon Fabian, Suter, Aagaard and symanski."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Whitworth", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Moussa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Family & Community Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Salihu", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Chardon Fabien", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine & Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Suter", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine & Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Aagaard", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}], "LastName": "Symanski", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES030285", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P42 ES027725", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P50 MD015496", "Acronym": "MD", "Agency": "NIMHD NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Reprod Health", "NlmUniqueID": "9918230899006676", "ISSNLinking": "2673-3153"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
