This work is devoted to new theoretical study of high-energy states for the main isotopologue 48O3 = 16O16O16O and for the family of 18O-enriched isotopomers 50O3 = {16O16O18O, 16O18O16O, 18O16O16O} of the ozone molecule considered using a full-symmetry approach. Energies and wave functions of bound states near the dissociation threshold are computed in hyperspherical coordinates accounting for the permutation symmetry of three identical nuclei in 48O3 and of two identical nuclei in 50O3, using the most accurate potential energy surface available now. The obtained vibrational band centers agree with observed ones with the root-mean-squares deviation of about 1 cm-1, making the results appropriate for assignments and analyses of future experimental spectra. The levels delocalized between the three potential wells of ozone isomers are computed and analyzed. The states situated deep in the three (for 48O3) or two (for 50O3) equivalent potential wells have similar energies with negligible splitting. However, the states situated just below the potential barriers separating the wells, are split due to the tunneling between the wells resulting in the splitting of rovibrational sub-bands. We evaluate the amplitudes of the corresponding effects and consider possible perturbations in vibration-rotation bands due to interactions between three potential wells. Theoretical predictions for the splitting of observable band centers are provided for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9945-0858"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL 32816, USA. slavako@ucf.edu."}], "LastName": "Kokoouline", "ForeName": "Viatcheslav", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Groupe de Spectrometrie Mol\u00e9culaire et Atmospherique, UMR CNRS 7331, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, F-51687, Reims Cedex 2, France. alexander.alijah@univ-reims.fr vladimir.tyuterev@univ-reims.fr."}], "LastName": "Lapierre", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4915-0558"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Groupe de Spectrometrie Mol\u00e9culaire et Atmospherique, UMR CNRS 7331, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, F-51687, Reims Cedex 2, France. alexander.alijah@univ-reims.fr vladimir.tyuterev@univ-reims.fr."}], "LastName": "Alijah", "ForeName": "Alexander", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2181-1158"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Groupe de Spectrometrie Mol\u00e9culaire et Atmospherique, UMR CNRS 7331, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, F-51687, Reims Cedex 2, France. alexander.alijah@univ-reims.fr vladimir.tyuterev@univ-reims.fr and Quamer Laboratory, Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Tyuterev", "ForeName": "Vladimir", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32642747", "10.1039/d0cp02177f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
