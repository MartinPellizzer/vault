The prediction model \"pulselessness of the radial artery OR respiration of mandibular movement OR the shock Index (SI) >1.0\" predicted death within 7 days with an accuracy of 83.9%, whereas the models developed to predict death within 72 and 24 hours had an accuracy of 65.0% or less. The median onset of all signs was within 3 days of death. The frequencies of decreased response to verbal stimuli and decreased response to visual stimuli were 76.0% and 74.0%, respectively. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The prediction model using physical signs and SI predicted death within 7 days in noncancer patients with high accuracy. The prediction of death within 72 and 24 hours in noncancer patients requires investigation of physical signs not examined in this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Takahiro Hosoi et al., 2021; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7878-005X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine and Primary Care, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kamisu Clinical Education and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Kamisu, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hosoi", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine and Primary Care, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Sachiko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0304-9881"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine and Primary Care, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hamano", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Maruo", "ForeName": "Kazushi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Medicine and Primary Care, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Primary Care and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan."}], "LastName": "Maeno", "ForeName": "Tetsuhiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Palliat Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101770666", "ISSNLinking": "2689-2820"}, "CoiStatement": "No competing financial interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Otani H, Yoshida S, Morita T, et al. : Meaningful communication before death, but not present at the time of death itself, is associated with better outcomes on measures of depression and complicated grief among bereaved family members of cancer patients.
