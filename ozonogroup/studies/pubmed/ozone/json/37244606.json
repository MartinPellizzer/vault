However, the interspecific variation of ISO<sub>rate</sub> sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub> and its key drivers remain largely unknown. In this study, four urban greening tree species were exposed to two O<sub>3</sub> treatments (charcoal-filtered air, CF; and non-filtered ambient air plus 60\u00a0ppb extra O<sub>3</sub>, EO<sub>3</sub>) in open-top chambers for one growing season. We aimed to compare the interspecific variation in O<sub>3</sub> inhibitory effect on ISO<sub>rate</sub> and explore its physiological mechanism. EO<sub>3</sub> decreased the ISO<sub>rate</sub> by on average 42.5\u00a0% across species. According to absolute effect size ranking, the highest ISO<sub>rate</sub> sensitivity to EO<sub>3</sub> was observed in Salix matsudana, followed by Sophora japonica and hybrid poplar clone '546', while Quercus mongolica ISO<sub>rate</sub> was the least sensitive. Leaf anatomical structures differed in tree species but did not respond to EO<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, the ISO<sub>rate</sub> sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub> was driven by the concurrent effects of O<sub>3</sub> on ISO synthesis ability (i.e., dimethylallyl diphosphate and isoprene synthase contents) and stomatal conductance. Overall, the mechanistic understanding grained from this study may promote the integrity of O<sub>3</sub> effect into process-based ISO emission models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
