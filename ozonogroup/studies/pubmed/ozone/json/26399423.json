The results show that Cu(acac)2 chemisorbs on the hollow site of the Cu(110) surface and decomposes easily into a Cu atom and the acac-ligands. A sequential dissociation and reduction of the Cu precursor [Cu(acac)2 \u2192 Cu(acac) \u2192 Cu] are observed. Further decomposition of the acac-ligand is unfavorable on the Cu surface. Thus additional adsorption of the precursors may be blocked by adsorbed ligands. Molecular hydrogen is found to be nonreactive towards Cu(acac)2 on Cu(110), whereas individual H atoms easily lead to bond breaking in the Cu precursor upon impact, and thus release the surface ligands into the gas-phase. On the other hand, water reacts with Cu(acac)2 on a Cu2O substrate through a ligand-exchange reaction, which produces gaseous H(acac) and surface OH species. Combustion reactions with the main by-products CO2 and H2O are observed during the reaction between Cu(acac)2 and ozone on the CuO surface. The reactivity of different co-reactants toward Cu(acac)2 follows the order H > O3 > H2O."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Center for Microtechnologies, Reichenhainer Str. 70, Chemnitz, D-09126, Germany. xiao.hu@zfm.tu-chemnitz.de."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schuster", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rg", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "Stefan E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gessner", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26399423", "10.1039/c5cp03707g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
