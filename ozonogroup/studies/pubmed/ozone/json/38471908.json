The results showed that the average annual concentration of VOCs was \uff0832.1 \u00b124.2\uff09\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\uff0c i.e.\uff0c at the national middle level. The seasonal concentrations of VOCs were in the order of\uff1a winter \uff0846.3\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\uff09&gt; autumn \uff0835.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\uff09&gt; spring \uff0825.6\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\uff09&gt; summer \uff0821.2\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>\uff09. Alkanes and OVOCs were the most dominant VOCs compounds\uff0c accounting for 69.0%-80.4% of TVOCs in Yuncheng. Affected by changes in source emissions\uff0c the proportion of OVOCs was higher in spring and summer \uff0841%-43%\uff09\uff0c whereas the proportion of alkanes was higher in autumn and winter \uff0842%-43%\uff09. Vehicle exhaust\uff0c LPG/NG\uff0c industrial production\uff0c and combustion sources were identified as the main sources of VOCs in Yuncheng. The largest contributors in the four seasons were vehicle exhaust \uff0828.5% in spring\uff09\uff0c secondary + combustion sources \uff0829.0% in summer\uff09\uff0c LPG/NG sources \uff0830.4% in autumn\uff09\uff0c and coal combustion \uff0827.3% in winter\uff09. The ozone formation was located in the transitional regime in summer and in the VOC-limited regime in other seasons. Ozone production was more sensitive to alkenes \uff08isoprene\uff0c ethylene\uff0c and propene\uff09\uff0c OVOCs \uff08acetaldehyde and propanal\uff09\uff0c and aromatics \uff08xylene\uff0c toluene\uff0c and benzene\uff09. Winter was more sensitive to ethylene\uff0c and the other seasons were more sensitive to isoprene. The primary emission sources related to these sensitive species should be reduced to achieve the goal of air quality improvement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xin-Gang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ya-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chen-Lu", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yuncheng Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau, Yuncheng 044000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongchangfu District Branch of Liaocheng Ecological and Environment Bureau, Liaocheng 252000, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471908", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202302178"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
