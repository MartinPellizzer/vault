Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide caused lesser accumulation of the isoflavonoids, and peroxyacetyl nitrate did not result in significant accumulation. Visible toxicity and chemical changes in ozone-fumigated leaves were similar to the hypersensitive disease defense reaction of soybean leaves to the pathogen Pseudomonas glycinea, except that the phytoalexin hydroxyphaseollin was not produced in the ozone-treated leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California 92502."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keen", "ForeName": "N T", "Initials": "NT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "O C", "Initials": "OC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1967 Jul;42(7):1023-4", "ArticleIdList": ["6047104"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1976", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16659156", "PMC541695", "10.1104/pp.55.4.731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
