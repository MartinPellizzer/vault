The GPP is a coaxial arrangement with inner and outer electrodes and utilizes a corona discharge to electrically charge the particles and a strong electric field to remove them from the sample flow. Several measures were taken to avoid an influence of the corona discharge on the gas composition. The GPP can be applied for various applications. This paper focuses on the use of the GPP as a pre-filter for gas analyzers, where zero pressure drop and a minimization of the influence of the corona discharge on the gas composition are the main objective. Due to its design, the GPP introduces no changes to the thermodynamic conditions. However, corona discharge is known to produce significant amounts of ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The effect of the corona on the gas composition of the sample flow was determined under various conditions. The gas concentrations strongly depended on several aspects, such as material and diameter of the corona wire and polarity of the corona voltage. Due to the measures taken to minimize an effect on the gas composition, the concentrations of these gases could effectively be reduced. Along with the maximum gas-particle separation efficiency of near 100%, the additional O3 concentration was 42 ppbV and the additional NO2 concentration 15 ppbV. If an efficiency of 95% is acceptable, the added concentrations can be as low as 2.5 ppbV (O3) and 0.5 ppbV (NO2), respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process and Aerosol Measurement Technology, University Duisburg-Essen, Bismarckstr. 81, 47057 Duisburg, Germany. asbach@me.umn.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asbach", "ForeName": "Christof", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuhlbusch", "ForeName": "Thomas A J", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fissan", "ForeName": "Heinz", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16121267", "10.1039/b502741a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
