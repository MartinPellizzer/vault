Individual pollutant effects are often addressed separately, despite coexisting in ambient air. The present investigation was performed to study the effects of sequential exposures to diesel exhaust (DE) and ozone on airway inflammation in human subjects. Healthy subjects underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial wash (BW) sampling on two occasions. Once following a DE exposure (with 300 mug.m(-3) particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mum) with subsequent exposure to O(3) (0.2 ppm) 5 h later. The other bronchoscopy was performed after a filtered air exposure followed by an ozone exposure, using an identical protocol. Bronchoscopy was performed 24 h after the start of the initial exposure. Significant increases in neutrophil and macrophage numbers were found in BW after DE followed by ozone exposure versus air followed by ozone exposure. DE pre-exposure also raised eosinophil protein X levels in BAL compared with air. The present study indicates additive effects of diesel exhaust on the ozone-induced airway inflammation. Together with similar results from a recent study with sequential diesel exhaust and ozone exposures, the present data stress a need to consider the interaction and cumulative effects of different air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, University Hospital, SE-901 85 Ume\u00e5, Sweden. jenny.bosson@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bosson", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barath", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pourazar", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Behndig", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blomberg", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adelroth", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur Respir J", "NlmUniqueID": "8803460", "ISSNLinking": "0903-1936"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicycling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Alveolar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18321939", "10.1183/09031936.00078407", "09031936.00078407"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
