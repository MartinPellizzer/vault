Cherry Belle) plants were transferred to a phytotron at the GSF M\u00fcnchen, where they were exposed in four large controlled climate chambers to two atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> , ('ambient', daily means of \u223c 385 \u03bcmol<sup>-1</sup> ; elevated, daily means of \u223c 765 \u03bcmol mol<sup>-1</sup> ) and two O<sub>3</sub> regimes ('non-polluted' air, 24 h mean of 20 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> ; polluted air, 24 h mean of 73 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> ). Leaf gas-exchange measurements were made at intervals, and visible O<sub>3</sub> damage, effects on growth, dry matter partitioning and mineral composition were assessed at a final whole-plant harvest after 27 d. In 'non-polluted air' CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment resulted in a progressive stimulation in A<sub>sat</sub> , whilst there was a decline in g which decreased E (i.e. improved WUE<sub>i</sub> ). The extra carbon fixed in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> stimulated growth of the root (+ hypocotyl) by 43 %, but there was no significant effect on shoot growth or leaf area. Moreover, a decline in SLA and LAR in CO<sub>2</sub> -enriched plants suggested that less dry matter was invested in leaf area expansion. Tissue concentrations of N, S, P, Mg and Ca were lower (particularly in the root + hypocotyl) in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> , indicating that total uptake of these nutrients was not affected by CO<sub>2</sub> , and there was an increase in the C:N ratio in root (+ hypocotyl) tissue. In contrast, O<sub>3</sub> depressed A<sub>sat</sub> , (\u223c 26%) and induced slight stomatal closure, with the result that WUE, declined. All plants exposed to 'polluted' air developed typical visible symptoms of O<sub>3</sub> injury, and effects on carbon assimilation were reflected in reduced growth, with shoot growth maintained at the expense of the root. In addition, O<sub>3</sub> increased the P and K concentration in shoot and root (+ hypocotyl) tissue, indicating enhanced uptake of these nutrients from the growth medium. However, there was no affect of O<sub>3</sub> on tissue concentrations of N, S, Mg and Ca. Interactions between the gases were complex, and often subtle. In general, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> counteracted (at least in part) the detrimental effects of phytotoxic concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> , whilst conversely, O<sub>3</sub> reduced the impact of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> . Moreover, there were indications that cumulative changes in source: sink relations in O<sub>3</sub> -exposed plants may limit plant response to CO<sub>2</sub> -enrichment to an even greater extent in the long-term. The future ecological significance of interactions between CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural & Environmental Science, Ridley Building, The University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GSF M\u00fcnchen, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstra\u00dfe 1, D-8042, Neuherberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfirrmann", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Allen, L.
