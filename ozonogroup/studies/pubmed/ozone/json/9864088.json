KBrO3 is used in cosmetics and food products and is a by-product of water disinfection by ozonization. KBrO3 is carcinogenic in the rat kidney, thyroid, and mesothelium and is a renal carcinogen in the male mouse. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship of time and dose to bromate-induced tumors in male Fischer 344 (F344) rats and to provide some insight into the development of these tumors. KBrO3 was dissolved in drinking water at nominal concentrations of 0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 g/L and administered to male F344 rats as the sole water source for 12, 26, 52, 78, or 100 wk. Renal cell tumors were present after 52 wk of treatment only in the high-dose group. Mesotheliomas developed after 52 wk of treatment on the tunica vaginalis. Mesotheliomas were present at sites other than the testicle after 78 wk of treatment, indicating that their origin was the testicular tunic. Thyroid follicular tumors were present as early as 26 wk in 1 rat each from the 0.1- and 0.2-g/L groups. The present study can be used as a basis for the determination of dose-time relationships of tumor development for a better understanding of KBrO3-induced cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA. wolf.doug@epamail.epa.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crosby", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kilburn", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "DeAngelo", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "7905907", "ISSNLinking": "0192-6233"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04MB35W6ZA", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium bromate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "06LU7C9H1V", "NameOfSubstance": "Triiodothyronine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q51BO43MG4", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Renal Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesothelioma"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Testicular Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroxine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triiodothyronine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9864088", "10.1177/019262339802600602"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
