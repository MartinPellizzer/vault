A model of the aerosol has been used to show that in the 9-11-microm region this assumption may be invalid since absorption by the aerosol makes the backscattering term a sensitive function of frequency and relative humidity. To illustrate the problem we examine five pairs of laser frequencies recommended in the literature for monitoring ammonia, ozone, ethylene, and Freon-11 and show that peak-to-peak differential backscatter of >10% is common across the whole humidity range. We also show that the sensitivity of backscattering to humidity changes is such that the volume backscattering coefficient at the on-line wavelength can become larger than the off-line value as the relative humidity increases, an effect that may nullify any rise in trace gas concentration that happens to take place."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petheram", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20372296", "10.1364/AO.20.003941", "25361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
