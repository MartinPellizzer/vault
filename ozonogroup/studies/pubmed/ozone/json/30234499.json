An excellent control of the ALD process was achieved by using an experimental procedure based on a sequence of micro-pulses, which provided long residence time and homogeneous diffusion of precursors, allowing ALD of thin films with smooth morphology and crystallinity which was found to increase with layer thickness, at temperatures as low as 250 \u00b0C. The resistive switching of symmetric Pt/Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Pt thin film devices exhibited bipolar mode with good stability and endurance. Multi-level switching was achieved via current and voltage control. It was proved that the ON state regime can be tuned by changing the current compliance while the OFF state can be changed to intermediate levels by decreasing the maximum voltage during RESET. The structural analysis of the switched oxide layer revealed the presence of nano-sized crystalline domains corresponding to different iron oxide phases, suggesting that Joule heating effects during I-V cycling are responsible for a crystallization process of the pristine amorphous layer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Politecnico di Torino, Applied Science and Technology Department, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Torino, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Porro", "ForeName": "Samuele", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bejtka", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jasmin", "ForeName": "Alladin", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fontana", "ForeName": "Marco", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milano", "ForeName": "Gianluca", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiolerio", "ForeName": "Alessandro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pirri", "ForeName": "Candido Fabrizio", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ricciardi", "ForeName": "Carlo", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30234499", "10.1088/1361-6528/aae2ff"]}}]}
