Microsites were designated mesic or xeric based on topography and bole growth in response to years of above-average precipitation. In mesic microsites, canopy response to O3 was characterized by thinner branches, earlier needle fall, less chlorotic leaf mottling, and lower foliar antioxidant capacity, especially of the aqueous fraction. In xeric microsites, canopy response to O3 was characterized by higher chlorotic leaf mottling, shorter needles, lower needle chlorophyll concentration, and greater foliar antioxidant capacity. Increased leaf chlorotic mottle in xeric microsites was related to drought stress and increased concurrent internal production of highly reactive oxygen species, and not necessarily to stomatal O3 uptake. Within-canopy position also influenced the expression of O3 injury in Jeffrey pine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pacific Southwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service, 4955 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA 92507, USA. ngrulke@fs.fed.us"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grulke", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Monschein", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nikolova", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tausz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Tree Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "100955338", "ISSNLinking": "0829-318X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14532016", "10.1093/treephys/23.13.923"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
