For eight years the EPA monitored ultraviolet (UV) radiation at this site, with the National Park Service (NPS) sponsoring a total climate and air monitoring station. Under the auspices of PRIMENet, research projects were initiated that investigated the effects of UV on amphibians, determined watershed mass balances, and developed a model of deposition along an elevational gradient. The monitoring data and research results have been used by park management to protect vegetation and water resources from ozone and deposition. These data are now being used to develop a \"vital signs\" monitoring program under the NPS' Inventory and Monitoring Program. These data sets have been used in regional, national and international programs to protect human health and resources from air pollution. Public outreach has been accomplished through web site resources and via the Schoodic Education and Research Center."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Park Service, Rocky Mountains Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit, University of Montana, School of Forestry, Forestry Building Room 103, Missoula, MT 59812, USA. kathy_tonnessen@nps.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tonnessen", "ForeName": "Kathy", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manski", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "legislation & jurisprudence", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2005 Jun;135(3):347-61", "ArticleIdList": ["15749533"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16957847", "10.1007/s10661-006-9327-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
