A continuous analysis of the kinetics of the reaction between ozone and pCBA was established, and the decay rate of ozone and pCBA with/without goethite was determined. The decay rate of ozone in the presence of goethite was much higher than in the absence of goethite and was strongly pH dependent due to the reactivities of ozone with the three surface species ( identical with FeOH(2)(+), identical with FeOH, identical with FeO(-)) of goethite. The removal pattern of ionized pCBA at different pHs agreed well with the instantaneous ozone demand. The removal rate of pCBA and instantaneous ozone demand with/without t-butanol at different pHs were compared to elucidate the reaction mechanisms associated with the three reaction sites: (i) on the surface of the catalyst, (ii) at the catalyst-solution interface, and (iii) in the bulk solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kwangju Institute of Science and Technology (K-JIST), Oryong-dong, Buk-gu, Kwangju 500 712, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jong-Sup", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Heechul", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Jaewon", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1310-14-1", "NameOfSubstance": "goethite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IC7888DF4L", "NameOfSubstance": "4-chlorobenzoic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorobenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15142789", "10.1016/j.watres.2004.01.040", "S0043-1354(04)00018-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
