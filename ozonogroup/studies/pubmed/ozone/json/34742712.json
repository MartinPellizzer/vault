Here we focused on the optical properties and sources of brown carbon (BrC) during the extreme atmospheric pollution periods. Enhanced formation of secondary BrC (BrC<sub>sec</sub>) was evident as relative humidity (RH) became higher, accompanied with a decrease of ozone but concurrent increases of aerosol water content and secondary inorganic aerosols. These features were generally similar to the characteristics of haze chemistry observed during winter haze events in the North China Plain, and indicated that heterogeneous reactions involving aerosol water might be at play in the formation of BrC<sub>sec</sub>, despite the low temperatures in Harbin. Although BrC<sub>sec</sub> accounted for a substantial fraction of brown carbon mass, its contribution to BrC absorption was much smaller (6 vs. 28%), pointing to a lower mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of BrC<sub>sec</sub> compared to primary BrC. In addition, emissions of biomass burning BrC (BrC<sub>BB</sub>) were inferred to increase with increasing RH, coinciding with a large drop of temperature. Since both the less absorbing BrC<sub>sec</sub> and the more absorbing BrC<sub>BB</sub> increased as RH became higher, the MAE of total BrC were largely unchanged throughout the measurement period. This study unfolded the contrast in the source apportionment results of BrC mass and absorption, and could have implications for the simulation of radiative forcing by brown carbon."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
