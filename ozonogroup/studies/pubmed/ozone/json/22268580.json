The surface coverage of polySBMA brushes on a hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) well plate with surface grafting weights ranging from 0.02 mg/cm(2) to 0.69 mg/cm(2) can be effectively controlled using the ozone pretreatment and thermal-induced radical graft-polymerization. The chemical composition, grafting structure, surface hydrophilicity, and hydration capability of prepared polySBMA brushes were determined to illustrate the correlations between grafting properties and blood compatibility of zwitterionic-grafted surfaces in contact with human UCB. The protein adsorption of fibrinogen in single-protein solutions and at complex medium of 100% UCB plasma onto different polySBMA brushes with different grafting coverage was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies. The grafting density of the zwitterionic brushes greatly affects the PS surface, thus controlling the adsorption of fibrinogen, the adhesion of platelets, and the preservation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in UCB. The results showed that PS surfaces grafted with polySBMA brushes possess controllable hydration properties through the binding of water molecules, regulating the bioadhesive and bioinert characteristics of plasma proteins and blood platelets in UCB. Interestingly, it was found that the polySBMA brushes with an optimized grafting weight of approximately 0.1 mg/cm(2) at physiologic temperatures show significant hydrated chain flexibility and balanced hydrophilicity to provide the best preservation capacity for HSPCs stored in 100% UCB solution for 2 weeks. This work suggests that, through controlling grafting structures, the hemocompatible nature of grafted zwitterionic polymer brushes makes them well suited to the molecular design of regulated bioadhesive interfaces for use in the preservation of HSPCs from human UCB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Municipal Hsaio-Kang Hospital, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Yung", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higuchi", "ForeName": "Akon", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shih", "ForeName": "Yu-Ju", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pei-Tsz", "Initials": "PT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wen-Yih", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Eing-Mei", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsiue", "ForeName": "Ging-Ho", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sulfobetaine methacrylate polymer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adhesiveness"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Blood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methacrylates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22268580", "10.1021/la203504h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
