In this study, we described an efficient approach to improve the mass-transfer performance of PCO/O<sub>3</sub> by using a helical photocatalytic module (HPM) in an annular UVC reactor. Under hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 19\u00a0min and influent phenol concentration of 33\u00a0mg/L (TOC 26\u00a0mg/L), TOC removal of 91.5% was obtained during a PCO/O<sub>3</sub> process with HPM, while TOC removal was only 58.1% without HPM (UVC/O<sub>3</sub>). This flowing through reactor displayed good stability in a continuous test lasting 20\u00a0h. The electric energy required to reduce TOC by one order of magnitude per cubic meter of solution was calculated to be 10.23 kWh/(m<sup>3</sup> order), which supported that the PCO/O<sub>3</sub> process in this flowing through reactor was energy-efficient compared with other processes (24.30-68.75 kWh/(m<sup>3</sup> order)). The steel-rolling wastewater after biological treatment was taken as a target. Under the HRT of 57\u00a0min and initial COD of 124\u00a0mg/L, COD in effluent dropped to 45.8\u00a0mg/L and met the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant of China."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
