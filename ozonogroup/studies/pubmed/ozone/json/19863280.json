Medical histories, quality-of-life questionnaires, spirometry, serum immunoglobulin (IgE), peripheral eosinophil counts, and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) were obtained during study visits. Personal ozone exposures over the 2 days before presentation were estimated based on location and activity surveys.", "Upper airway symptoms were more frequent in asthmatics. Higher levels of ozone were associated with worse airflow obstruction, lower quality of life scores, greater eosinophilia, and higher exhaled NO levels in asthmatics. Finally, both asthmatics and non-asthmatics with allergies showed associations between air quality and airway inflammation.", "In adults with asthma but not controls studied during peak ozone season, increasing ozone exposure predicted lower lung function and increased biomarkers of respiratory and systemic inflammation. These associations were enhanced in atopic participants, both with and without asthma. Importantly, the study findings were noted while atmospheric ozone levels were predominantly within the current and revised national air quality standards."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, MetroHealth Medical Center, Case School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44109, USA. skhatri@metrohealth.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khatri", "ForeName": "Sumita B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holguin", "ForeName": "Fernando C", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryan", "ForeName": "P Barry", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mannino", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erzurum", "ForeName": "Serpil C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teague", "ForeName": "W Gerald", "Initials": "WG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K12 RR017643", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "K12 RR017643-05", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "UL1 TR000454", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "K12 RR 017643", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asthma", "NlmUniqueID": "8106454", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Interest.
