A visible red laser diode emitting at 638\u00a0nm was employed as a light source. The photoacoustic cell consisted of a conventional resonance tube with a MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) microphone placed outside an opening along the tube. A calibration curve for the range from 33 ppmV to 215 ppmV was found to be highly linear with a coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) of 0.9999, when allowing for different measurement frequencies to account for shifts in the speed of sound due to changes in the gas matrix. The limit of detection was found to be 1.6 ppmV for an optical power of the laser diode of about 130\u00a0mW."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
