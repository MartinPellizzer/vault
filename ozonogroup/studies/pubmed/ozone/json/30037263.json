The experimental measurements of the kinetic isotope effect of k(OH + HBr)/k(OH + DBr) found that the kinetic isotope effects are temperature-independent. However, previous quasi-classical trajectory calculations on an accurate ab initio potential energy surface showed that the kinetic isotope effect is temperature-dependent. By contrast, the present full-dimensional time-dependent quantum dynamics calculations on the same potential energy surface find that the kinetic isotope effect is temperature-independent, agreeing well with the experimental studies both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the rate constants from both quantum dynamics and quasi-classical trajectory calculations have a peak at around 15 K whereas the experimental data are not available in this low temperature range. The good agreement of the temperature-dependence of kinetic isotope effects between the present quantum dynamics calculations and the experimental measurements indicates that the kinetic isotope effect of k(OH + HBr)/k(OH + DBr) should be temperature-independent and the peak of the rate constants from the theoretical calculations call for experimental measurements at a very low temperature range."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan 250014, Shandong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Physics and Electronics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan 250014, Shandong, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000000251303488"], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dunyou", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30037263", "10.1063/1.5037542"]}}]}
