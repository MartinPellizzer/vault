Our prior work in a U.S. nationwide study suggests a strong association between both chronic and acute temperature extremes and stillbirth risk.", "We attempted to replicate our prior study by assessing stillbirth risk associated with average whole-pregnancy temperatures and acute ambient temperature changes in a low-risk U.S.", "Singleton deliveries in the NICHD Consecutive Pregnancies Study (Utah, 2002-2010; n\u00a0=\u00a0112,005) were identified using electronic medical records. Ambient temperature was derived from the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Binary logistic regression determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for stillbirth associated with whole-pregnancy exposure to extreme cold (<10th percentile) and hot (>90th percentile) versus moderate (10th-90th percentiles) average temperature, adjusting for maternal demographics, season of conception, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and gestational diabetes. In a case-crossover analysis, we estimated the stillbirth aOR and 95% CI for each 1\u00b0 Celsius increase during the week prior to delivery using conditional logistic regression. In both models, we adjusted for relative humidity, ozone, and fine particulates.", "We observed 500 stillbirth cases among 498 mothers. Compared to moderate temperatures, whole-pregnancy exposure to extreme cold (aOR: 4.42, 95% CI:3.43, 5.69) and hot (aOR: 5.06, 95% CI: 3.34, 7.68) temperatures were associated with stillbirth risk. Case-crossover models observed a 7% increased odds (95% CI: 1.04, 1.10) associated with each 1\u00b0 Celsius increase during the week prior to delivery.", "Both chronic and acute ambient temperature were associated with odds of stillbirth in this low-risk population, similar to our prior nationwide findings.
