Both the effects of tetrakis (dimethylamido) zirconium(IV) growth temperature and oxidants, such as water (H2O) and ozone (O3), were investigated. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows the amorphous characteristic of the 80-nm-thick films grown at 80 \u00b0C, the crystallinity of the films was much lower than those grown at 140 and 200 \u00b0C. The scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that the surface morphology strongly depended on the crystallinity of the film. The water vapor transmission rate of the 80 nm thick ZrO2 films can be reduced from 3.74 \u00d7 10(-3) g/(m(2) day) (80 \u00b0C-H2O as the oxidant) to 6.09 \u00d7 10(-4) g/(m(2) day) (80 \u00b0C-O3 as the oxidant) under the controlled environment of 20 \u00b0C and a relative humidity of 60%. Moreover, the organic light-emitting diodes integrated with 80 \u00b0C-O3-derived ZrO2 films were undamaged, and their luminance decay time changed considerably. This was attributed to the better barrier property of the low-temperature ZrO2 film to the amorphous microscopic bulk and almost homogeneous microscopic surface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics, College of Electronic Science and Engineering, Jilin University , Jilin 130012, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Fengbo", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yongqiang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Yahui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24598603", "10.1021/am500288q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
