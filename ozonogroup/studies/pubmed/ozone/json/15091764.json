However, quantitative predictions of the response of individual trees, stands, and forest ecosystems to pollutants and climatic variables require extrapolation of existing data sets, derived largely from seedling studies, to increasing levels of complexity with little or no understanding of the uncertainties associated with these extrapolations. Consequently, a project designed to address concerns associated with scaling from seedling to mature tree responses was initiated. During the 1990 and 1991 growing seasons, mature northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) trees and seedlings were exposed to subambient, ambient, and twice ambient ozone (O(3)) concentrations. The initial focus of the study was to identify possible trends and obvious differences between mature trees and seedlings, both in terms of growth and physiology and in response to O(3). Generally, mature trees exhibited a greater decrease in photosynthesis rates over the growing season than did the seedlings. Ozone treatments had no consistent effect on gas exchange rates of seedlings, but the twice ambient O(3) treatment resulted in reduced photosynthesis rates in the mature tree. Despite no effect of O(3) on seedling gas exchange rates, total seedling biomass was significantly less at the end of the 1991 growing season for those seedlings exposed to twice ambient O(3) levels. Disproportionate reductions in root biomass also resulted in reduced root to shoot ratios at elevated O(3) concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tennessee Valley Authority, Cooperative Forest Studies Program, TVA Forestry Building, Norris, Tennessee 37828, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Edwards", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wullschleger", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091764", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)90036-1", "0269749194900361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
