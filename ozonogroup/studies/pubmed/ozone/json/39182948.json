Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with reduced lung function in children that can persist into adulthood. Using an established model of asymmetrical FGR in Long-Evans rats, this study investigated sex differences in effects of early life ozone exposure on lung development and maturation. Adverse health effects for i) gestational exposure (with impacts on primary alveolarization), ii) peri-adolescent exposure (with impacts on secondary alveolarization), and iii) cumulative exposure across both periods were evaluated. Notably, female offspring were most affected by gestational ozone exposure, likely because of impaired angiogenesis and corresponding decreases in primary alveolarization. Females had diminished lung capacity, fewer mature alveoli, and medial hypertrophy of small and large pulmonary arteries. Males, especially FGR-prone offspring, were more affected by peri-adolescent ozone exposure. Males had increased ductal areas, likely due to disrupted secondary alveolarization. Altered lung development may increase risk of developing diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension disproportionately affects women. In the United States, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease prevalence is increasing, especially in women; and prevalence for both men and women is highest in urbanized areas. This investigation underlines the importance of evaluating results separately by sex, and provides biologic plausibility for later consequences of early-life exposure to ozone, a ubiquitous urban air pollutant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiopulmonary and Immunotoxicology Branch, Public Health and Integrated Toxicology Division, Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
