Emission regulations have historically targeted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to reduce ozone, but intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) also contribute to ozone formation and the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) that often dominates fine particulate matter. Emission rates and pollutant formation from IVOCs are not well constrained in current inventories and models. This study uses diesel fuel as a representative IVOC mixture in evaporation tests performed in a wind tunnel under varying wind speeds and liquid diesel temperatures. Comprehensive composition measurements guided the development of a model to determine rates of evaporation and estimate pollutant production. Results show that reducing IVOC emissions can result in significant reductions in ozone formation, in addition to the expected reductions in SOA formation, and that IVOC emissions can continue over the course of a month. Ozone formation from IVOC emissions is equal to that from VOCs after 3 days of evaporation at 0.65 g-ozone/g-diesel released. SOA formation is dominated by IVOCs, reaching 0.2 g-SOA/g-diesel released after 30 days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9195-6360"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College, Waterville, 04901 Maine, United States."}], "LastName": "Drozd", "ForeName": "Greg T", "Initials": "GT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3114, California, United States."}], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "Robert Jay", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4014-4896"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3114, California, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3114, California, United States."}], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33861084", "10.1021/acs.est.0c08832"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
