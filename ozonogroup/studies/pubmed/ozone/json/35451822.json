Analysis of the collected microdroplets by NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of hydrogen peroxide at a concentration level ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 \u03bcM depending on the flow conditions. This was confirmed using a spectrofluorometric assay. We suggest that this finding establishes that when sprayed to form microdroplets, water has the ability to produce hydrogen peroxide by itself. When the N<sub>2</sub> gas is replaced by compressed air or O<sub>2</sub> gas, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is found to increase, indicating that gas-surface interactions with O<sub>2</sub> in aqueous microdroplets promote the formation of hydrogen peroxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1544-7257"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305 United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehrgardi", "ForeName": "Masoud A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7160-8967"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305 United States."}], "LastName": "Mofidfar", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5266-4253"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305 United States."}], "LastName": "Zare", "ForeName": "Richard N", "Initials": "RN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35451822", "10.1021/jacs.2c02890"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
