The intensity of this photolysis reaction affects atmospheric oxidation and photochemical pollution process. Photolysis rate of nitrogen dioxide (JNO<sub>2</sub>) is affected by aerosols, temperature, solar zenith angle (SZA), clouds, and so on. Among them, aerosol is an important influencing factor because of its complicated and irregular change; aerosol quantitative effect on JNO<sub>2</sub> is constructive for the coordinated control of O<sub>3</sub> and particulate matter. In order to quantitatively assess the impact of aerosols on JNO<sub>2</sub> in the long-term, the reconstructed JNO<sub>2</sub> data in a suburban site in North China from 2005 to 2019 are used. We found that JNO<sub>2</sub> and aerosol optical depth (AOD) presented logarithmic relations under different solar zenith angle (SZA) levels, the aerosol attenuation effect on JNO<sub>2</sub> decreased as AOD increased. Two main influencing factors of JNO<sub>2</sub>, SZA, and AOD, were fitted into a quadratic polynomial to quantify the AOD effect on JNO<sub>2</sub>. The results showed that the average annual AOD effect on JNO<sub>2</sub> in Xianghe from 2005 to 2019 was -28.6% compared to an aerosol free atmosphere; the seasonal mean AOD effect in spring, summer, autumn, and winter was -27.1% and -35.1%, -25.5% and -26.3%, respectively. During the study period, JNO<sub>2</sub> increased with an average of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-5</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> per year, while the annual average aerosol optical depth (AOD) was 0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10, showing an overall downward trend. Annual mean AOD attenuation effect on JNO<sub>2</sub> decreased over time; the decreases were larger in spring and summer, and smaller in autumn and winter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
