We also employed recombinant viral genome RNA infection models to confirm our observations.", "Our results indicated that ozone inactivated PV1 primarily by disrupting the 5'-non-coding region (5'-NCR) of the PV1 genome.

Recombinant viral genome RNA infection models con\ufb01rmed that PV1 lacking this region was non-infectious.", "In this study, we not only elucidated the mechanisms by which ozone induces PV1 inactivation but also determined that the 80-124 nt region in the 5'-NCR is targeted by ozone to achieve this inactivation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.
