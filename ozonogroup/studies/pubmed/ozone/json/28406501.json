However, the detection of disinfectant-injured or genetically modified (GM) E. coli has been largely overlooked so far. To evaluate the accuracy of culture-dependent enumeration with regard to disinfectant-injured and GM E. coli, chlorine- or ozone-injured wild-type (WT) and GM E. coli were prepared and characterized. Then, water samples contaminated with these E. coli strains were assayed by four widely used methods, including lactose tryptose broth-based multiple-tube fermentation (MTF), m-endo-based membrane filtration method (MFM), an enzyme substrate test (EST) known as Colilert, and Petrifilm-based testing slip method (TSM). It was found that MTF was the most effective method to detect disinfectant-injured WT E. coli (with 76.9% trials detecting all these bacteria), while this method could not effectively detect GM E. coli (with uninjured bacteria undetectable and a maximal detection rate of 21.5% for the injured). The EST was the only method which enabled considerable enumeration of uninjured GM E. coli, with a detection rate of over 93%. However, the detection rate declined to lower than 45.4% once the GM E. coli was injured by disinfectants. The MFM was invalid for both disinfectant-injured and GM E. coli. This is the first study to report the failure of these commonly used enumeration methods to simultaneously detect disinfectant-injured and GM E. coli. Thus, it highlights the urgent requirement for the development of a more accurate and versatile enumeration method which allows the detection of disinfectant-injured and GM E. coli on the assessment of microbial quality of drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Health, Tianjin Institute of Health and Environmental Medicine, Key Laboratory of Risk Assessment and Control for Environment & Food Safety, Tianjin 300050, China. jinminzh@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Hong-Mei", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Ai-Ming", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Da-Ning", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Chen-Shi", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jian-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteriological Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Quality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28406501", "10.1039/c6em00625f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
