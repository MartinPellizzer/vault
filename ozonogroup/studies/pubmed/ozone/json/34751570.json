Therefore, one must distinguish and identify all such forms across compound classes, over a wide dynamic range as minor species often have critical activities. With all the power of modern mass spectrometry for compositional assignments by accurate mass, the identical precursor and often fragment ion masses render this task a steep challenge. This is recognized in proteomics and epigenetics, where proteoforms are disentangled and characterized employing novel separations and non-ergodic dissociation mechanisms. This issue is equally pertinent to lipidomics, where the lack of isomeric depth has thwarted the deciphering of functional networks. Here we introduce a new platform, where the isomeric lipids separated by high-resolution differential ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) are identified using ozone-induced dissociation (OzID). Cationization by metals (here K<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, and especially Cu<sup>+</sup>) broadly improves the FAIMS resolution of isomers with alternative C\u2550C double bond (DB) positions or stereochemistry, presumably via metal attaching to the DB and reshaping the ion around it. However, the OzID yield diminishes for Ag<sup>+</sup> and vanishes for Cu<sup>+</sup> adducts. Argentination still strikes the best compromise between efficient separation and diagnostic fragmentation for optimal FAIMS/OzID performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, Kansas 67260, United States."}], "LastName": "Berthias", "ForeName": "Francis", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0420-6116"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Physics, Faculty of Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia."}], "LastName": "Poad", "ForeName": "Berwyck L J", "Initials": "BLJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, Kansas 67260, United States."}], "LastName": "Thurman", "ForeName": "Hayden A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, Kansas 67260, United States."}], "LastName": "Bowman", "ForeName": "Andrew P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8560-756X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Analytical Research Facility, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Physics, Faculty of Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia."}], "LastName": "Blanksby", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4004-481X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Wichita State University, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, Kansas 67260, United States."}], "LastName": "Shvartsburg", "ForeName": "Alexandre A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Soc Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9010412", "ISSNLinking": "1044-0305"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34751570", "10.1021/jasms.1c00251"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
