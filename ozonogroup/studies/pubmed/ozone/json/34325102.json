We used a plasmid (pUC19)-encoded ampicillin resistance gene (amp<sup>R</sup>) in both extracellular (e-) and intracellular (i-) forms. The second-order rate constant (k<sub>O3</sub>) for degradation of 2686 base pair (bp) long e-pUC19 toward O<sub>3</sub>, which was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, was calculated to be ~2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. The deactivation rate constants of e-pUC19 by O<sub>3</sub> measured with various recipient E. coli strains were within a factor of 2 compared with the degradation rate constant for e-pUC19. The degradation/deactivation kinetics of i-pUC19 were similar to those of e-pUC19, indicating only a minor influence of cellular components on O<sub>3</sub> reactivity toward i-pUC19. For FAC, the degradation and deactivation rates of e-pUC19 were decreased in the presence of tert\u2011butanol, implying involvement of direct FAC as well as some radical (e.g., <sup>\u2022</sup>OH) reactions. The degradation rates of e-amp<sup>R</sup> segments by direct FAC reaction could be explained by a previously-reported two-step sequential reaction model, in which the rate constants increased linearly with e-amp<sup>R</sup> segment length. The deactivation rate constants of e-pUC19 during exposure to FAC were variable by a factor of up to 4.3 for the different recipient strains, revealing the role of DNA repair in the observed deactivation efficiencies. The degradation/deactivation of e-pUC19 were significantly faster at pH 6.8 than at pH 8.1 owing to pH-dependent FAC speciation variation, whereas i-pUC19 kinetics exhibited much smaller dependence on pH, demonstrating intracellular plasmid DNA reactions with FAC occurred at cytoplasmic pH (~7.5). Our results are useful for predicting and/or measuring the degradation/deactivation efficiency of plasmid-encoded ARGs by water treatment with ozonation and chlorination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
