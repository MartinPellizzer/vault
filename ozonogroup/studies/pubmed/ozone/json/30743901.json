Stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) under optimal growth conditions was stimulated by enhanced N supply but was not significantly affected by enhanced O<sub>3</sub> exposure. Birch root, woody (stem\u202f+\u202fbranches) and total biomass (root\u202f+\u202fwoody) were not affected by the Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD<sub>1</sub>SPEC) after two seasons of O<sub>3</sub> exposure, and enhanced N supply stimulated biomass production independent of POD<sub>1</sub>SPEC (i.e. there were no POD<sub>1</sub>SPEC\u202f\u00d7\u202fN interactions). There was a strong linear relationship between the stem cross-sectional area and tree biomass at the end of the experiment, which was not affected by O<sub>3</sub> exposure or N load. Enhanced N supply stimulated the stem cross-sectional area at the end of season 2, but not at the end of season 1, which suggests a time lag before tree biomass responded to enhanced N supply. There was no significant effect of POD<sub>1</sub>SPEC on stem cross-sectional area after either the first or second growing season of the experiment. Contrasting results reported in the literature on the interactive impacts of O<sub>3</sub> and N load on tree physiology and growth are likely due to species-specific responses, different duration of the experiments and/or a limitation of the number of O<sub>3</sub> and N levels tested."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
