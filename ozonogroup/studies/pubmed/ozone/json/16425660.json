Wheezing during the spring and summer months was associated with community levels of airborne particulate matter with a diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.46-5.80), but was not associated with community levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 (diameter < or = 2.5), nitric acid, or formic acid. Logistic regression was performed on data stratified into two seasonal groups, spring/summer and fall/winter. Among asthmatics, the monthly prevalence of asthma medication use was associated with monthly levels of ozone, nitric acid, and acetic acid (OR = 1.80 [95%CI = 1.19-2.70]; OR = 1.80 [95%CI = 1.23-2.65]; OR = 1.57 [95% CI = 1.11-2.21]; respectively). Asthma medication use was more prevalent among children who spent more time outdoors--with consequential exposure to ozone--than among children who spent more time indoors (OR = 3.07 [95%CI = 1.61-5.86]; OR = 1.31 [95%CI = 0.47-2.71]; respectively). The authors concluded that monthly variations in some ambient air pollutants were associated with monthly respiratory morbidity among school children."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.
