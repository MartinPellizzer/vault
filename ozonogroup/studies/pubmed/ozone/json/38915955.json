The use of ozone in dental practice is also well-established. Its utilization as a mouth rinse needs to be explored for further application in clinical practice, especially for cases of gingivitis, a common complaint. This systematic review aims to analyze the literature on the effects of ozonated water in managing gingival inflammation and bleeding across diverse populations. A systematic search adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\u00a0(PRISMA)\u00a0guidelines was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane. Studies published between January 2012 and December 2023 employing ozonated water as a treatment for gingivitis or gingival bleeding were included. Five studies met the inclusion criteria, demonstrating the varied efficacy of ozonated water. While some studies showed promising results in reducing bleeding and gingival inflammation, others indicated limitations compared to chlorhexidine. Methodological heterogeneity and lack of standardization were notable. The evidence suggests potential benefits of ozonated water in managing gingival inflammation and bleeding, but methodological variations hinder conclusive findings. Long-term studies with larger sample sizes and standardized protocols are needed to establish the effectiveness of ozonated water as an adjunctive therapy for gingival health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Bansode et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dentistry, Private Practice, Pune, IND."}], "LastName": "Bansode", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Naturopathy and Yoga, National Institute of Naturopathy, Pune, IND."}], "LastName": "K", "ForeName": "Satyalakshmi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Naturopathy and Yoga, National Institute of Naturopathy, Pune, IND."}], "LastName": "D", "ForeName": "Sathyanath", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research, National Institute of Naturopathy, Pune, IND."}], "LastName": "Muralidharan", "ForeName": "Shrikanth", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Oral health equals total health: a brief review.
