However, few studies have investigated the effects of short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on daily outpatient visits for respiratory diseases. We examined the effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on the daily outpatient visits for respiratory diseases, explored the sensitivities of different population subgroups and analyzed the relative risk (RR) of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in different seasons in Shanghai during 2013-2016. The generalized linear model (GLM) was applied to analyze the exposure-response relationship between air pollutants (daily average PM<sub>2.5</sub> and daily maximum 8-h average O<sub>3</sub>), and daily outpatient visits due to respiratory diseases. The sensitivities of males and females at the ages of 15-60 yr-old and 60+ yr-old to the pollutants were also studied for the whole year and for the cold and warm months, respectively. Finally, the results of the single-day lagged model were compared with that of the moving average lag model. At lag 0 day, the RR of respiratory outpatients increased by 0.37% with a 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (RR, 1.0047, 95% CI, 1.0032-1.0062) was more sensitive for females than for males (RR, 1.0025, 95% CI, 1.0008-1.0041), and was more sensitive for the 15-60 yr-old (RR, 1.0041, 95% CI, 1.0027-1.0055) than the 60+ yr-old age group (RR, 1.0031, 95% CI, 1.0014-1.0049). O<sub>3</sub> was not significantly associated with respiratory outpatient visits during the warm periods, but was negatively associated during the cold periods. PM<sub>2.5</sub> was more significantly in the cold periods than that in the warm periods. The results indicated that control of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, compared to O<sub>3</sub>, in the cold periods would be more beneficial to the respiratory health in Shanghai. In addition, the single-day lagged model underestimated the relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and outpatient visits for respiratory diseases compared to the moving average lag model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
