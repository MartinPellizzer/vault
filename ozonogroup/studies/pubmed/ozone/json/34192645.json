The developed model has significantly improved the simulated hydrochloric acid (HCl), particulate chloride (PCl), and hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO<sub>2</sub>) radicals. O<sub>3</sub> is enhanced in the high chlorine emission regions by up to 4% and depleted in the rest of the region. PM<sub>2.5</sub> is enhanced by 2-6%, mostly due to the increases in PCl, ammonium, organic aerosols, and sulfate. Nitrate exhibits inhomogeneous variations, by up to 8% increase in Shanghai and 2-5% decrease in most of the domain. Radicals show different responses to the inclusion of the multiphase chlorine chemistry during the daytime and nighttime. Both OH and HO<sub>2</sub> are increased throughout the day, while nitrate radicals (NO<sub>3</sub>) and organic peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) show an opposite pattern during the daytime and nighttime. Higher HCl and PCl emissions can further enhance the atmospheric oxidation capacity, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Therefore, the anthropogenic chlorine emission inventory must be carefully evaluated and constrained."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
