Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models are regarded as an efficient tool in simulating spatial-temporal dynamics of GPP. However, the accuracy assessment of GPP simulations from LUE models at both spatial and temporal scales remains a challenge. In this study, we simulated GPP of vegetation in China during 2007-2014 using a LUE model (Vegetation Photosynthesis Model, VPM) based on MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) images with 8-day temporal and 500-m spatial resolutions and NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) climate data. Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data were used to compare with VPM simulated GPP (GPP<sub>VPM</sub>) temporally and spatially using linear correlation analysis. Significant positive linear correlations exist between monthly GPP<sub>VPM</sub> and SIF data over a single year (2010) and multiple years (2007-2014) in most areas of China. GPP<sub>VPM</sub> is also significantly positive correlated with GOME-2 SIF (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f>\u202f0.43) spatially for seasonal scales. However, poor consistency was detected between GPP<sub>VPM</sub> and SIF data at yearly scale. GPP dynamic trends have high spatial-temporal variation in China during 2007-2014. Temperature, leaf area index (LAI), and precipitation are the most important factors influence GPP<sub>VPM</sub> in the regions of East Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Loss Plateau, and Southwestern China, respectively. The results of this study indicate that GPP<sub>VPM</sub> is temporally and spatially in line with GOME-2 SIF data, and space-borne SIF data have great potential for evaluating LUE-based GPP models."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
