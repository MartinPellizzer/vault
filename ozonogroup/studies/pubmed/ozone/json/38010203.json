This study demonstrated that iron-based photochemistry significantly enhanced alkyl halide production by promoting the reaction of the representative monomer of lignin with halide ions in saline water under solar light irradiation. The methyl chloride (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) emission from the light/Fe(III) process was 2 orders of magnitude higher than dark treatment and in the absence of iron. In addition, bromide and iodide showed better reactivity in the formation of the corresponding methyl bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br) and methyl iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>I). Alkyl halides identified from seawater, brackish water, and salt pan water under sunlight irradiation were positively correlated with the Fe(III) concentrations, indicating that iron-based photochemistry is ubiquitous. This work suggested that the photoinduced formation of methyl radical and redox cycling of iron triggered by the Fenton-like reaction are responsible for the enhanced release of alkyl halides. This study represents an abiotic formation pathway of alkyl halides, which accounts for a portion of the unidentified sources of halocarbons in the ocean."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6955-9935"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, P.
