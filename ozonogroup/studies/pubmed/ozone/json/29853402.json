All the steps of ashing pretreatment were automatically accomplished within forty minutes. Gold-plated infrared quartz tubes produced focused infrared to supply a rapid heating. Ozone was used to accelerate sample carbonization. A cool trap was used to capture volatile arsenic, cadmium and lead. Three certified plant food reference materials were determined. The recoveries of the three elements were between 90% and 107%. Five real plant foods were analyzed by the proposed method and microwave digestion. The results showed no significant difference."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
