The results indicated that degradation rate of ozonation alone and ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation decreased by 11.6% and 9.6% with the increase of the concentration of formaldehyde (0-12 mg x L(-1)). The degradation rates of the two processes both increased firstly and decreased subsequently with the increase of the concentration of methanol (0-16 mg x L(-1)). The degradation rate of ozonation alone reached the climax at the concentration of methanol 2 mg x L(-1), and that of ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation reached the culmination at the concentration of methanol 4 mg x L(-1) under the same experimental condition. With the increase of the concentration of formic acid (0-8 mg x L(-1)), the degradation rates also increased firstly and decreased subsequently, and those of ozonation alone and ceramic honeycomb-catalyzed ozonation reached the vertex, respectively, at the concentration of methanol 0.5 mg x L(-1) and 2 mg x L(-1). At the lower concentration, methanol and formic acid could accelerate the degradation of nitrobenzene, however, the reaction was retarded at higher concentrations of methanol and formic acid. The degradation rates of ozonation alone and ozonation/ceramic honeycomb both declined by 19.7% and 18.6% with the increase of the concentration of dibutyl phthalate (0-10 mg x L(-1))."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China. zhaolei999999@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng-Qian", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-Zhong", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Yan-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E57JCN6SSY", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrobenzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18624185"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
