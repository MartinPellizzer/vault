A time course for plasma concentration of 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA, a salicylate metabolite and an indicator for hydroxyl radical) in response to 0.12 ppm ozone was also studied. Healthy, young, nonsmoking volunteers were given acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 975 mg) or placebo orally. Subjects were exposed to ozone (0.12 or 0.4 ppm) or filtered air in an environmental chamber for 2 h, while performing intermittent exercise. Blood was collected hourly over a 4-h period. After exposure, nasal lavage fluid was collected, and sputum was induced using hypertonic saline. Results show that in sputum the percentage of neutrophils was significantly higher after the subjects were exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone (p<.05) than after they were exposed to filtered air or 0.12 ppm ozone. The absolute number and the percentage of macrophages were significantly lower at 0.4 ppm ozone than for filtered air control or 0.12 ppm ozone. The percentage of lymphocytes in sputum was also significantly lower at 0.4 ppm ozone than for filtered air control or 0.12 ppm ozone. The sputum cellular responses to ozone were not significantly altered by ASA treatment. In nasal lavage, cell counts and differentials did not change significantly after exposure to ozone in comparison to filtered air control. The cellular data indicate an acute inflammation developed during ozone exposure in the lower respiratory tract. The concentrations of total protein and interleukin-8 and the activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (a lysosomal enzyme) in nasal lavage and sputum did not change significantly following exposure to ozone in comparison to filtered air control. Plasma 2,3-DHBA concentration increased significantly following exposure to 0.12 ppm ozone in an exposure-dependent temporal pattern. Salicylate metabolites in nasal lavage fluid and sputum did not increase significantly following exposure to ozone. There was a marked variation of 2,3-DHBA concentrations in airway fluids. Data suggest that plasma 2,3-DHBA is a sensitive marker indicating acute ozone exposure, even at an ozone concentration that causes minimal observable airway effects in healthy subjects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Health Directorate, Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada. ling_liu@hc-sc.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leech", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urch", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poon", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zimmerman", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubay", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silverman", "ForeName": "F S", "Initials": "FS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylates"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sputum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutic Irrigation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10477441", "10.1080/089583799196790"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
