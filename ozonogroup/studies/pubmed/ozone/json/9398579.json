The upper levels of these A-type bands which are rather close in energy (they appear respectively at 5291.722 and 5307.790 cm-1) belong to two different sets of interacting polyads. To correctly reproduce the rotation-vibration energy levels and account for the observed perturbations, both bands are treated in a dyad approximation: the (123) state in the Coriolis resonance with the (330) state, and the (401) state in the Coriolis resonance with the (024) state. The assignments of the rotation-vibration levels of the (123) state are confirmed by measurements of line positions of the hot band nu1 + 2nu2 + 3nu3 - nu2 which has also been observed for the first time. The fits are very satisfactory: the r.m.s. deviation for 249 energy levels of the (123) state is 2.4 x 10(-3) cm-1 and is 2.0 x 10(-3) cm-1 for 266 levels of the (401) state. These r.m.s. are near experimental accuracy. Transition moments for the three observed bands are determined from measured line intensities. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.
