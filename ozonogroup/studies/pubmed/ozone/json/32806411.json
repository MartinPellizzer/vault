However, the effects of stress combinations are unpredictable and differ to the effects of individual stressors. Here we studied the effects of exposure to the phytotoxic air-pollutant ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), feeding by larvae of the large cabbage white butterfly (Pieris brassicae), and a combination of the two stresses, on the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by black mustard plants (Brassica nigra) under field and laboratory conditions. Field-grown B.\u00a0nigra plants were also measured for carbon-nitrogen (C-N) content, net photosynthetic activity (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs) and biomass. The effects of O<sub>3</sub> on interactions between plants and a herbivorous pest were addressed by monitoring the abundance of wild diamondback moth larvae (Plutella xylostella) and feeding-damage to B.\u00a0nigra plants in an O<sub>3</sub>-free air concentration enrichment (O<sub>3</sub>-FACE) field site. Herbivore-feeding induced the emission of VOCs that were not emitted by undamaged plants, both under field and laboratory conditions. The combination of O<sub>3</sub> and herbivore-feeding stresses resulted in enhanced emission rates of several VOCs from field-grown plants. Short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure (of 10 days) and P.\u00a0brassicae-feeding did not affect C-N content, but chronic O<sub>3</sub> exposure (of 34 and 47 days) and P.\u00a0brassicae-feeding exacerbated suppression of Pn. Ozone exposure also caused visible injury and decreased the plant biomass. Field-grown B.\u00a0nigra under elevated O<sub>3</sub> were infested with fewer P.\u00a0xylostella larvae and received significantly less feeding damage. Our results suggest that plants growing in a moderately polluted environment may be of reduced quality and less attractive to foraging herbivores."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
