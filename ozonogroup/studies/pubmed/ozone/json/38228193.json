The EHCO process exhibited high sulfadiazine (SDZ) and TOC removal efficiency compared with electrocatalysis (EC) and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) process. Almost 100% of SDZ was removed within 2\u00a0min, and the TOC removal reached approximately 85% within 60\u00a0min. Quenching experiments and EPR analysis suggested that the prominent SDZ and TOC removal performance is supported by the enhanced \u00b7OH generation ability. Further study proved that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formed by O<sub>2</sub> electrochemical reduction, peroxone reaction and electrochemical reduction of ozone contributed to improving \u00b7OH generation. Furthermore, the EHCO system showed satisfactory stability and recyclability compared to conventional HCO systems, and the SDZ and TOC removal rates were maintained at \u226595% and \u226570% in 16 consecutive recycles, respectively. Meanwhile, XPS analysis and Boehm's titration for the FeOx/PAC catalyst used in HCO and EHCO process confirmed that the external electron supply could restrain the oxidation of surface functional groups of PAC and maintain a balance of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio, which proved the critical role of cathode reduction in catalyst in situ regeneration during long consecutive recycles. In addition, the EHCO system could achieve more than 80% SDZ removal within 2\u00a0min in different water matrices. These results confirmed that the EHCO process has a wide application perspective for refractory organics removal in actual wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
