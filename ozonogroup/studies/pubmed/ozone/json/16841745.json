Based on the results of a series of tertiary treatment experiments, the effects of three filtration processes, i.e. coagulation-filtration, ozonation-biological activated carbon filtration (O3-BAC) and ultrafiltration (UF), and two chemical disinfection processes, i.e. chlorination and ozonation, on the safety of water re-use were evaluated. It was found that the concentrations of the main pollutants in the secondary effluent and further filtered water follow a log-normal distribution and, therefore, a log-normal probabilistic function can be used to evaluate the suitability of the treated water for re-use purposes. Among the three filtration processes evaluated, UF is the most effective in turbidity removal but less effective in colour and COD removal, while coagulation-filtration and O3-BAC can ensure a good removal of all these pollutants. Regarding chemical disinfection, although chlorine is very effective in inactivation of coliform bacteria, it can not achieve a substantial decrease in viruses. As ozone is applied, effective virus removal can be achieved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, China. xcwang@xauat.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X C", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16841745", "10.2166/wst.2006.264"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
