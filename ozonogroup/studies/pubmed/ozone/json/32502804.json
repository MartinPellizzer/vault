With increased production, come the hazards associated with the toxic elements present in the effluents. Various microorganisms are currently employed in the remediation of these toxic effluents. In addition, various techniques like ozonation, electrocoagulation, UV treatment, Fenton's reagent, and photo-Fenton based techniques are used in advanced oxidation processes to reduce these toxins from effluents. This review highlights various above mentioned advanced techniques and innovative processes along with the biological remediation of these toxic effluents with the help of some potential microbial consortia or their combinatory effects. Moreover, the present review will also disclose the ideas on utilizing the tools of metabolic engineering, systems biology, and artificial intelligence towards microbial engineering for relatively better bioremediation processes. In the future, these techniques might be helpful in increasing the capability of microbial consortia towards detoxification of effluents to make them environmentally safe. Finally, this review gives well-synchronized approaches to get more insights into these innovative methodologies and techniques and their use for various industrial applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
