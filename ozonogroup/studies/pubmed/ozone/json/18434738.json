In this study, we evaluated the effect of HOS on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by oleic acid in rabbits.", "24 rabbits were randomized into four groups: control (C), oleic acid (OA), inhaled oxygen (OX), and HOS treatment (HOS). The ALI model was produced by administrating oleic acid intravenously. Half an hour after oleic acid infusion, animals received inhaled oxygen at 30% FiO2 or 20 ml/kg HOS intravenously. Various parameters were measured during the 2 h after oleic acid treatment.", "After treatment with oleic acid, mean arterial pressure and PaO2 decreased significantly compared to group C (p < 0.01), while lung/body ratio, lung water content, and the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and TNF-alpha in the serum and BALF increased significantly (p < 0.01). Histologically, interstitial edema, alveoli exudation and massive inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the lung. However, when treated with 20 ml/kg HOS, PaO2 significantly increased compared to group OA (p < 0.05). The MPO and TNF-alpha levels in the serum and BALF were decreased (p < 0.01), pulmonary edema was reduced (p < 0.01). Improved pathological manifestations were observed.", "HOS at 20 ml/kg has therapeutic effects to ameliorate the biological and morphological changes to the lung induced by oleic acid. HOS is a safe, simple and effective measure to protect animals from ALI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2008 S.
