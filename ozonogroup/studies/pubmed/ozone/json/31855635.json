It consisted of two parts: (1) the catalytic ozonation of NO over FeO<sub>x</sub>/SAPO-34 to study the effects of the various influencing factors, and (2) the absorption-oxidation of NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> induced by ozone combined with a NH<sub>3</sub>/(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> solution in a bubble column reactor. In Part 1, results showed that under the optimal condition of a molar ratio of 0.5 for O<sub>3</sub>/NO, a residence time of 3\u00a0s, a water vapor volume fraction of 4%, a NO initial concentration of 536\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup>, and a SO<sub>2</sub> initial concentration of 343\u00a0mg/m<sup>3</sup>, the oxidation rate of NO was 55%. The characterizations of poisoned catalyst are briefly discussed. In Part 2, as the gas passed sequentially through the ozonizing reactor and the absorber (NH<sub>3</sub>/(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> solution of 0.8% ammonia and 0.2\u00a0mol/L (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), a NO conversion rate of approximately 92.6% and SO<sub>2</sub> conversion rate of 100% were obtained. The pH of the NH<sub>3</sub>/(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> solution had a significant impact on the NO conversion. According to the analysis of the composition of products under different pHs, a mechanism of desulfurization and denitrification based on NH<sub>3</sub>/(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> solutions was proposed.
