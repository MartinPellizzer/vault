Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) has antioxidant properties that may improve NO bioavailability. Moreover, tempol increases oral nitrite-derived gastric formation of S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). We hypothesized that pretreatment with tempol may further increase tissue concentrations of NO-related species after oral nitrite administration and therefore we carried out a time-dependent analysis of how tempol affects the concentrations of NO metabolites in different tissues after oral nitrite administration to rats. NO metabolites (nitrate, nitrite and RSNO) were assessed by ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence assays in plasma, stomach, aorta, heart and liver samples obtained from anesthetized rats at baseline conditions and 15\u00a0min, 30\u00a0min, 2\u00a0h or 24\u00a0h after oral nitrite (15\u00a0mg/kg) was administered to rats pretreated with tempol (18\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle 15\u00a0min prior to nitrite administration. Aortic protein nitrosation was assessed by resin-assited capture (SNO-RAC) method. We found that pretreatment with tempol transiently enhanced nitrite-induced increases in nitrite, RSNO and nitrate concentrations in the stomach and in the plasma (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), particularly for 15-30\u00a0min, without affecting aortic protein nitrosation. Pretreatment with tempol enhanced nitrite-induced increases in nitrite (but not RSNO or nitrate) concentrations in the heart (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In contrast, tempol attenuated nitrite-induced increases in nitrite, RSNO or nitrate concentrations in the liver. These findings show that pretreatment with tempol affects oral nitrite-induced changes in tissue concentrations of NO metabolites depending on tissue type and does not increase nitrite-induced vascular nitrosation. These results may indicate that oral nitrite therapy aiming at achieving increased nitrosation of cardiovascular targets requires appropriate doses of nitrite and is not optimized by tempol."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
