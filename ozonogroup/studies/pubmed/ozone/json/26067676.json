Results from the 2011 DJ on-site study indicate that emissions from condensate storage tanks are highly variable and can be an important source of VOCs and HAPs, even when control measures are present. Comparison of the measured condensate tank emissions with potentially emitted concentrations modeled using E&P TANKS (American Petroleum Institute [API] Publication 4697) suggested that some of the tanks were likely effectively controlled (emissions less than 95% of potential), whereas others were not. Results also indicate that the use of a commercial high-volume sampler (HVS) without corresponding canister measurements may result in severe underestimates of emissions from condensate tanks. Instantaneous VOC and HAP emissions measured on-site on controlled systems in the DJ Basin were significantly higher than VOC and HAP emission results from the study conducted by Eastern Research Group (ERG) for the City of Fort Worth (2011) using the same method in the Barnett on pads with low or no condensate production. The measured VOC emissions were either lower or not significantly different from the results of studies of uncontrolled emissions from condensate tanks measured by routing all emissions through a single port monitored by a flow measurement device for 24 hr. VOC and HAP concentrations measured remotely using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Other Test Method (OTM) 33A in the DJ Basin were not significantly different from the on-site measurements, although significant differences between basins were observed.", "VOC and HAP emissions from upstream production operations are important due to their potential impact on regional ozone levels and proximate populations. This study provides information on the sources and variability of VOC and HAP emissions from production pads as well as a comparison between different measurement techniques and laboratory analysis protocols. On-site and remote measurements of VOC and HAP emissions from oil and gas production pads indicate that measurable emissions can occur despite the presence of control measures, often as a result of leaking thief hatch seals on condensate tanks. Furthermore, results from the remote measurement method OTM 33A indicate that it can be used effectively as an inspection technique for identifying oil and gas well pads with large fugitive emissions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education Fellowship , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "LastName": "Brantley", "ForeName": "Halley L", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thoma", "ForeName": "Eben D", "Initials": "ED"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eisele", "ForeName": "Adam P", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorado"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oil and Gas Fields"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Remote Sensing Technology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26067676", "10.1080/10962247.2015.1056888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
