Previous studies reported that ozone and erythropoietin could alleviate IR effect on several organs. The current research is established to evaluate the possible protective role of ozone versus erythropoietin following IR injury of the gastrocnemius muscle. Fifty rats were equally divided into five groups: I control, II ischemia reperfusion (IR), III post-reperfusion ozone treated, IV post-reperfusion erythropoietin-treated, and V recovering post-reperfusion without treatment groups. The right femoral arteries of all rats were clamped for three hours to induce ischemia then clamps were released to allow reperfusion for two hours. Rats of group II were scarified immediately after reperfusion period. Rats of group III were injected with ozone just after reperfusion for 14\u00a0days. Animals of group IV were injected with erythropoietin just after reperfusion for 14 days. Rats of group V rats were kept for 2\u00a0weeks following reperfusion without treatment. Blood samples were obtained to estimate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) enzymes. Gastrocnemius muscle was processed for measurement of tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as examination by light and electron microscopes. iNOS and PCNA immunohistochemistry and statistical analysis were applied. The current results indicated that both ozone and erythropoietin could be used as protective agents reducing the muscular damage induced by IR injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gawish", "ForeName": "Magdy F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Selim", "ForeName": "Sally A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Star", "ForeName": "Alyaa A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5339-8073"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Samah M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ultrastruct Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8002867", "ISSNLinking": "0191-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "11096-26-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Erythropoietin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythropoietin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35130793", "10.1080/01913123.2022.2035874"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
