This study targets the Sichuan Basin (SCB), a deep basin isolated by plateaus and mountains in Southwest China, by employing WRF-Chem with integrated process rates (IPR) analysis to characterize the terrain-driven seasonal variations of tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) with atmospheric physical and chemical processes. Results show that the basin terrain exerts reversed impacts on regional air quality changes by aggravating summertime and alleviating wintertime near-surface O<sub>3</sub> with the relative contributions oscillating seasonally between -40% and 40% in SCB. Similarly, a seasonal shift of vertical O<sub>3</sub> structures is dominated by summertime positive and wintertime negative changes in the lower troposphere induced by basin terrain. The key contributions of atmospheric process to near-surface O<sub>3</sub> are identified with vertical and horizontal transport, which is dominated by basin terrain with intensifying seasonal and diurnal variations. With the existence of basin, the daytime O<sub>3</sub> productions at the near-surface layer are elevated in months of warm seasons (April and July) but inhibited in the cold seasons (October and January), presenting a seasonal transition of primary factor from meteorology to aerosol-radiation forcing on photochemical reactions. Driven by plateau-basin thermodynamic forcing, horizontal O<sub>3</sub> transport between the SCB and eastern TP is enhanced by mountain-plains solenoid (MPS), and even nocturnal O<sub>3</sub>-rich layers contribute to the impacts of vertical exchange on near-surface O<sub>3</sub> levels. The terrain effects of deep basin under the interaction of Asian monsoons and westerlies could jointly change atmospheric physical and chemical processes to construct the seasonal and diurnal O<sub>3</sub> evolution patterns over the SCB region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
