Two schemes were conducted: firstly, a single ozonation stage followed by an UF stage; and secondly, a membrane filtration stage, using different MF and UF membranes, followed by a chemical oxidation stage, where ozone, UV radiation, and the AOPs constituted by ozone plus UV radiation and ozone plus hydrogen peroxide, were used. The membrane filtration stages were carried out in tangential filtration laboratory equipment, and the membranes used were two MF membranes with pores sizes of 0.65 and 0.1microm, and three UF membranes with molecular weights cut-off of 300, 10, and 5kDa. The effectiveness of the different stages (conversions in the chemical procedures and rejection coefficients in the membrane processes) were evaluated in terms of several parameters which measure the global pollutant content of the wastewater: COD, absorbance at 254nm, tannins content, color, and ellagic acid. In the ozonation/UF combined process the following removals were achieved: 100% for ellagic acid and color, 90% for absorbance at 254nm, more than 80% for tannins, and 42-57% for COD reduction. In the filtration/chemical oxidation combined process, 100% elimination of ellagic acid, more than 90% elimination in color, absorbance at 254nm and tannins, and removal higher than 80% in COD were reached, which indicates a greater purification power of this combination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica, Universidad de Extremadura, 06071 Badajoz, Spain. javben@unex.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben\u00edtez", "ForeName": "F Javier", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acero", "ForeName": "Juan L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leal", "ForeName": "Ana I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Real", "ForeName": "Francisco J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17693018", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.07.007", "S0304-3894(07)00989-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
