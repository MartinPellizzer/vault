In this paper we present results for plasma-polymerised acetonitrile deposited onto silicon or polystyrene substrates. The chemistry of films deposited under a range of experimental conditions was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). XPS provided evidence that the elemental composition of the films varied with rf power to flow rate parameter (W/F) with films produced at higher W/F being deficient in nitrogen. FTIR revealed that the plasma deposited film contained a wide range of nitrogen functional groups including amine, imine and nitrile. Oxidation of the films by exposure to radiation from a low pressure mercury vapour lamp in an air ambient increased the surface oxygen levels from 3 to 17at.% after 300 s exposure. XPS also revealed that the oxidation process proceeded via the formation of carbonyl groups at short exposure times (<60s) while longer treatment times (>60s) resulted in an increase in the concentration of carboxyl groups. To assess their potential to support cell growth, polystyrene culture dishes coated with plasma deposited films and UV-ozone oxidised films were seeded with 1BR.3.N human fibroblast cells and incubated for up to 72 h. Un-oxidised plasma-polymerised acetonitrile films were found to give comparable cell attachment densities as tissue culture polystyrene. The greatest cell attachment density was found with plasma polymer films which had been UV-ozone treated for the longest time (300 s). Enhanced attachment to this surface was attributed to the high level of carboxylic groups found on this substrate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Materials & Biomaterials Research Centre, School of Engineering, The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen AB25 1HG, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davidson", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bradley", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "9315133", "ISSNLinking": "0927-7765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetonitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetonitriles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15261060", "10.1016/j.colsurfb.2004.01.008", "S0927-7765(04)00022-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
