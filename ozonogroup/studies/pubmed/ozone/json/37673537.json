Synthesis parameters, including hydrothermal time and temperature and molar ratio of precursors, significantly affected the ozone removal performance and structure property of MnO<sub>x</sub>. Amorphous MnO<sub>x</sub>-1.5, which was prepared at the Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>7+</sup> molar ratio of 1.5 under hydrothermal conditions of 120\u00b0C and 2 hr, showed the highest ozone removal rate of 93% after 480 min at the room temperature, RH (relative humidity)\u00a0=\u00a080% and WHSV (weight hourly space velocity)\u00a0=\u00a0600 L/(g\u00b7hr). The morphology, composition and structure of catalysts were investigated with X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectra, N<sub>2</sub> physisorption, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H<sub>2</sub> temperature-programmed reduction (H<sub>2</sub>-TPR), O<sub>2</sub> temperature-programmed desorption (O<sub>2</sub>-TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS). It was confirmed that high catalytic activity of amorphous MnO<sub>x</sub> for ozone removal was mainly ascribed to its abundant oxygen vacancies, high oxygen mobility and large specific surface area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
