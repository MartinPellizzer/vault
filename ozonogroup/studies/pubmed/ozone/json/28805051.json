One recent approach has sought to formulate an entropy and Gibbs energy based on observed scale invariances in geophysical variables, particularly in atmospheric quantities, including the molecules constituting stratospheric chemistry. The Hamiltonian flux dynamics of energy in macroscopic open nonequilibrium systems maps to energy in equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, and corresponding equivalences of scale invariant variables with other relevant statistical mechanical variables such as entropy, Gibbs energy, and 1/(k<sub>Boltzmann</sub>T), are not just formally analogous but are also mappings. Three proof-of-concept representative examples from available adequate stratospheric chemistry observations-temperature, wind speed and ozone-are calculated, with the aim of applying these mappings and equivalences. Potential applications of the approach to scale invariant observations from the literature, involving scales from molecular through laboratory to astronomical, are considered. Theoretical support for the approach from the literature is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2074-0538"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Visiting Professor, Physics Department, Imperial College London , London, U.K."}], "LastName": "Tuck", "ForeName": "Adrian F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28805051", "10.1021/acs.jpca.7b03112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
