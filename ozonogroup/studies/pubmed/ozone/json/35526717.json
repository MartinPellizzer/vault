As these pollutants are toxic and recalcitrant, it is essential to address the above issue with efficient, economical, and eco-friendly technologies. In this review, initially, an overview of the characteristics of wastewater discharged from different petroleum refinery units is discussed. Further, various pre-treatment and post-treatment strategies for complex PRW are introduced. A segregated approach has been proposed to treat the crude desalting, sour, spent caustic, and oily wastewater of petroleum refineries. The combined systems (e.g., ozonation\u00a0+\u00a0moving bed biofilm reactor and photocatalysis\u00a0+\u00a0packed bed biofilm reactor) for the treatment of low biodegradability index wastewater (BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD\u00a0<\u00a00.2) were discussed to construct a perspective map and implement the proposed system efficiently. The economic, toxicity, and biodegradability aspects are also introduced, along with research gaps and future scope."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
