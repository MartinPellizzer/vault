A case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were applied for data analyses. Exposures to particulate matter \u22642.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), particulate matter \u226410 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were estimated by inverse distance weighted averages of all monitoring stations within 50 km from each case's home address. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Each interquartile range (IQR) increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag 3; IQR, 47.1 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), NO<sub>2</sub> (lag 03; IQR, 26.3 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>), and O<sub>3</sub> (lag 3; IQR, 52.9 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) were positively associated with asthma mortality, with odds ratios of 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.12), 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.22), and 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.18), respectively. There was no evidence of departure from linearity for these associations. Further adjustment for other pollutants did not change the associations materially. We did not observe significant associations between PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO exposures and asthma mortality. Overall, the estimates remained consistent in various sensitivity analyses. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results provide new evidence that short-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> may increase asthma mortality risk. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in other populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory for Applied Toxicology and."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-5970-4262"], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuewei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Institute of Chronic Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-0099-7985"], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jingju", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory for Applied Toxicology and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 National Meteorological Information Center, Beijing, China; and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Chunxiang", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory for Applied Toxicology and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jixuan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-1758-7499"], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Institute of Chronic Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7603-4045"], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9421642", "ISSNLinking": "1073-449X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2019 Jul 1;200(1):1-2. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201903-0579ED", "PMID": "30912954"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30871339", "10.1164/rccm.201810-1823OC"]}}]}
