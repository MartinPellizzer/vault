This study evaluates the performance efficiency in pilot-scale for the three reactors such as membrane bioreactor, ozonised membrane bioreactor and further clubbed with photocatalysis. The membrane filtration consists of polyvinilidine difluoride hollow fibre membrane module having pore size 0.1\u202f\u03bcm. Tungsten oxide, a visible photocatalyst was made into spongy alginate beads and used in photocatalytic reactor. The photocatalyst dose has been optimised as 500\u202fmg/L. About 10% membrane filterability ratio has been achieved by integrating ozone with MBR with the maximal ozone dosage of 5\u202fg/h. It showed better removal efficiency in colour and chemical oxygen demand of 94% and 93% respectively. The biodegradability efficiency also was enhanced from 0.2 to 0.4 with optimised ozone dosage (5\u202fg/h). The study on reversible and irreversible fouling has been done to understand the fouling nature. The important analysis such as microbial community and scanning electron microscopy analysis were done to study the biofouling and extent of fouling after filtration. The treatability studies implemented for textile wastewater showed that integrated MBR systems are suitable in meeting the discharge norms prescribed by the Indian statutory body in terms of chemical oxygen demand, colour and total suspended solids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
