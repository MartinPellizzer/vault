The processing has been compared to other low energy and environmentally friendly electrochemical exfoliation (EE) techniques. The results show USO can be used to prepare highly stable aqueous dispersions from both low and high surface area EG. The level of oxygen functionalization can be easily controlled with processing time as can the dispersion concentration. The degree of disorder in the GNP structure is similar to existing EE methods but offers higher yields without the need to remove any chemicals post-processing. Ink-jet printing onto heated quartz substrates produced films which reached electrical conductivities of 1400 s m(-1) after annealing. The films printed from USO-processed EGs had higher conductivity and significantly reduced thickness as compared to films printed from aqueous dispersions of reduced graphene oxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DSTO, 506 Lorimer St., Fisherman's Bend, Melbourne, VIC 3207, Australia. andrew.rider@dsto.defence.gov.au"}], "LastName": "Rider", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thostenson", "ForeName": "E T", "Initials": "ET"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brack", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25414172", "10.1088/0957-4484/25/49/495607"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
