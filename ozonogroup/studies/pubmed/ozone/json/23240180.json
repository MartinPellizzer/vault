In this study, changes in sludge and supernatant after ozonation of return activated sludge were investigated for seven different ozone doses. The optimum ozone dose to avoid inhibition of ozonation and high ozone cost was determined in terms of disintegration degree as 0.05 g O3/gTS. Suspended solid and volatile suspended solid concentrations of sludge decreased by 77.8% and 71.6%, respectively, at the optimum ozone dose. Ozonation significantly decomposed sludge flocs. The release of cell contents was proved by the increase of supernatant total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP). While TN increased from 7 mg/L to 151 mg/L, TP increased from 8.8 to 33 mg/L at the optimum ozone dose. The dewaterability and filterability characteristics of the ozonated sludge were also examined. Capillary suction time increased with increasing ozone dosage, but specific resistance to filtration increased to a specific value and then decreased dramatically. The particle size distribution changed significantly as a result of floc disruption at an optimum dose of 0.05 gO3/gTS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, Buca-Izmir, Turkey. ozlem.demir@deu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demir", "ForeName": "Ozlem", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Filibeli", "ForeName": "Ayse", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23240180", "10.1080/09593330.2011.650220"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
