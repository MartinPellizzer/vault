One of the main reasons for concern is the possible effect of EDCs on human health. EDCs may be released into the environment in different ways, and one of the most significant sources is industrial wastewater. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the treatment performance of different wastewater treatment procedures (biological treatment, filtration, advanced oxidation processes) for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand and seven selected EDCs (dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, bisphenol A and nonylphenol) from wastewaters from a mill producing 100 % recycled paper. Two pilot plants were running in parallel and the following treatments were compared: (i) anaerobic biological treatment followed by aerobic biological treatment, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO), and (ii) anaerobic biological treatment followed by membrane bioreactor and RO. Moreover, at lab-scale, four different advanced oxidation processes (Fenton reaction, photo-Fenton reaction, photocatalysis with TiO(2), and ozonation) were applied. The results indicated that the concentrations of selected EDCs from paper mill wastewaters were effectively reduced (100 %) by both combinations of pilot plants and photo-Fenton oxidation (98 %), while Fenton process, photocatalysis with TiO(2) and ozonation were less effective (70 % to 90 %, respectively)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pulp and Paper Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia. damjan.balabanic@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balabani\u010d", "ForeName": "Damjan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hermosilla", "ForeName": "Daphne", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Merayo", "ForeName": "Noem\u00ed", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klemen\u010di\u010d", "ForeName": "Aleksandra Krivograd", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blanco", "ForeName": "Angeles", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endocrine Disruptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22571523", "10.1080/10934529.2012.672301"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
