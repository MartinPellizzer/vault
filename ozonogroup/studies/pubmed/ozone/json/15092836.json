Effects of selected combinations were evaluated in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. New Yorker) seedlings using sequential exposures to enhanced UV-B radiation and O(3) in differential CO(2) concentrations. Ambient (7.2 kJ m(-2 )day(-1)) or enhanced (13.1 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) UV-B fluences and ambient (380 microl l(-1)) or elevated (600 microl l(-1)) CO(2) were imposed for 19 days before exposure to 3-day simulated O(3) episodes with peak concentrations of 0.00, 0.08, 0.16 or 0.24 microl l(-1) O(3) in ambient or elevated CO(2). CO(2) enrichment increased dry mass, leaf area, specific leaf weight, chlorophyll concentration and UV-absorbing compounds per unit leaf area. Exposure to enhanced UV-B increased leaf chlorophyll and UV-absorbing compounds but decreased leaf area and root/shoot ratio. O(3) exposure generally inhibited growth and leaf photosynthesis and did not affect UV-absorbing compounds. The highest dose of O(3) eliminated the stimulating effect of CO(2) enrichment after ambient UV-B pre-exposure on leaf photosynthesis. Pre-exposure to enhanced UV-B mitigated O(3) damage to leaf photosynthesis at elevated CO(2)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Harrow, Ontario, Canada N0R 1G0."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hale", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormrod", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Papadopoulos", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092836", "10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00305-x", "S0269-7491(99)00305-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
