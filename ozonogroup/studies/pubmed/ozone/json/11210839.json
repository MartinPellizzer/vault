Before PO3 administration, more than half (57.4%) of the patients received only 1 or 2 antituberculous drugs (ethambutole and ethionamide or ethambutole and oprofloxacin). PO3 produced a pronounced disintoxifying effect, resulting in cessation of bacterial isolation. The stabilization of a tuberculous process was verified by clinical, X-ray, and laboratory studies in 75.8% of patients. This made it possible to perform bulky operations on the lung. When there was a postoperative progression of the underlying process in the single lung, chemotherapy was supplemented by intravenous PO3, which also promoted the stabilization of the process. The use of PO3 expands the spectrum of used agents and enhances the impact of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients isolating multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis in both pre- and postoperative periods, this increases the rate of operability in the most serious patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Belianin", "ForeName": "I I", "Initials": "II"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Titiukhina", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Usilenie \u00e9ffekta khimioterapii tuberkuleza parenteral'nym vvedeniem rastvorennogo ozona."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Probl Tuberk", "NlmUniqueID": "0414141", "ISSNLinking": "0032-9533"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11210839"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
