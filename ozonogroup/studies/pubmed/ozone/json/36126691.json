In this study, denitrification rate and product ratio (i.e., N<sub>2</sub>O/(N<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0+\u00a0N<sub>2</sub>) ratio) were investigated by soil-core incubation based N<sub>2</sub>/Ar technique in one rice paddy field (RP) and two vegetable fields (VF4 and VF7, 4 and 7 years vegetable cultivating after conversion from rice fields, respectively). Genes related to denitrification and bacterial community composition were quantified to investigate the microbial mechanisms behind the effects of land-use conversion. The results showed that conversion of rice fields to vegetable fields did not significantly change denitrification rate although the abundance of denitrification related genes was significantly reduced by 79.22%-99.84% in the vegetable soils. Whereas, compared with the RP soil, N<sub>2</sub>O emission rate was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased by 53.5 and 1.6 times in the VF4 and VF7 soils, respectively. Correspondingly, the N<sub>2</sub>O/(N<sub>2</sub>O\u00a0+\u00a0N<sub>2</sub>) ratio increased from 0.18% (RP soil) to 5.65% and 0.65% in the VF4 and VF7 soils, respectively. These changes were mainly attributed to the lower pH, higher nitrate content, and the altered bacterial community composition in the vegetable soils. Overall, our results showed that conversion of rice fields to vegetable fields increased the N<sub>2</sub>O emission rate and altered the product ratio of denitrification. This may increase the contribution of land-use conversion to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
