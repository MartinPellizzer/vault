Their concentration variation directly affects the characteristics of the ozone pollution. The concentration, speciation of VOCs, ozone and its precursors in Nanjing were analyzed and measured using online gas detection systems in August 2013. VOCs/NOx discriminant method was used to get the sensitive control factors of ozone. The results showed that the averaged volume fraction of VOCs was 52. 05 x 10(-9), and the largest one reached 200 x 10(-9) in Nanjing urban district. The order of volume fraction of each species VOCs was alkane > oxygen-containing VOCs > alkene > aromatics. The averaged concentration of ozone was 76.5 microg x m(-1) and the exceeding concentration of hourly standard was 5.9%. The change trends of ozone precursors VOCs and NOx were basically identical and Ozone showed the obvious negative correlation during the period of high concentrations of ozone. There were some differences in the concentrations of the same VOCs in different ozone concentration periods. The ozone generation in Nanjing urban district was sensitive to VOCs, and Nanjing belonged to VOCs control area in summer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-xiao", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Li-li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yun-jiang", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Ying-feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wen-tai", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hong-cang", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Rong-xin", "Initials": "RX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27363129"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
