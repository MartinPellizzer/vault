In order to explore the causes of ozone pollution in YRD, we use the GEOS-Chem and its adjoint model to study the sensitivities of ozone to its precursor emissions from different source regions and emission sectors during heavy ozone pollution events under typical circulation patterns. The Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) of Tsinghua University and 0.25\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.3125\u00b0 nested grids are adopted in the model. By using the T-mode principal component analysis (T-PCA), the circulation patterns of heavy ozone pollution days (observed MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentrations \u2265160\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) in Nanjing located in the center area of YRD from 2013 to 2019 are divided into four types, with the main features of Siberian Low, Lake Balkhash High, Northeast China Low, Yellow Sea High, and southeast wind at the surface. The adjoint results show that the contributions of emissions emitted from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the largest to heavy ozone pollution in Nanjing. The 10\u00a0% reduction of anthropogenic NO<sub>x</sub> and NMVOCs emissions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai could reduce the ozone concentrations in Nanjing by up to 3.40\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> and 0.96\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. However, the reduction of local NMVOCs emissions has little effect on ozone concentrations in Nanjing, and the reduction of local NO<sub>x</sub> emissions would even increase ozone pollution. For different emissions sectors, industry emissions account for 31\u00a0%-74\u00a0% of ozone pollution in Nanjing, followed by transportation emissions (18\u00a0%-49\u00a0%). This study could provide the scientific basis for forecasting ozone pollution events and formulating accurate strategies of emission reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
