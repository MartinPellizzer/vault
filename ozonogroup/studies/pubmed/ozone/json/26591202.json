Group 1 was intact control, groups 2 and 3 were subjected to model thermal trauma, and group 3 were daily intraperitoneally injected with 3 ml of 0.3 mM of aqueous DNIC solution for 10 days. In addition, the DNIC solution action was studied in vitro on isolated human blood with oxidative stress conditions induced by high doses of ozone. All blood samples (both in vitro and in vivo) were characterized with respect to lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant activity, and erythrocyte resistance to peroxidation. It is established that DNIC leads to optimization of blood pro- and antioxidant systems in animals subjected to thermal trauma associated with pronounced oxidative stress. This effect was manifested by clear reduction (normalization) of lipid peroxidation with noticeable increase in the antioxidant potential of blood plasma. This tendency was also observed for erythrocyte membranes. The antioxidant action of DNIC was also confirmed by the results of in vitro experiments on human blood with model of oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martusevich", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soloveval", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Davydyuk", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peretyagin", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Eksp Klin Farmakol", "NlmUniqueID": "9215981", "ISSNLinking": "0869-2092"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "68586-27-6", "NameOfSubstance": "dinitrosyl iron complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26591202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
