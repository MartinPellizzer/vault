Epidemiologic evidence further suggests impairment with higher long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure across early and middle childhood, although study findings to date are mixed and few have investigated vulnerable subgroups.", "Participants from the CANDLE study, a pregnancy cohort in Shelby County, TN, in the ECHO-PATHWAYS Consortium, were included if children were born at gestational age >32 weeks, completed a spirometry exam at age 8-9, and had a valid residential history from birth to age 8. We estimated lifetime average ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposure based on each child's residential history from birth to age 8, using a validated fine-resolution spatiotemporal model. Spirometry was performed at the age 8-9 year study visit to assess Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) as primary outcomes; z-scores were calculated using sex-and-age-specific reference equations. Linear regression with robust variance estimators was used to examine associations between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and continuous lung function z-scores, adjusted for child, sociodemographic, and home environmental factors. Potential susceptible subgroups were explored using a product term in the regression model to assess effect modification by child sex, history of bronchiolitis in infancy, and allergic sensitization.", "In our sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0648), O<sub>3</sub> exposure averaged from birth to age 8 was modest (mean 26.6 [SD 1.1] ppb). No adverse associations between long-term postnatal O<sub>3</sub> exposure were observed with either FEV<sub>1</sub> (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.12, 95% CI: -0.04, 0.29) or FVC (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.03, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.19). No effect modification by child sex, history of bronchiolitis in infancy, or allergic sensitization was detected for associations with 8-year average O<sub>3</sub>.", "In this sample with low O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, we did not observe adverse associations between O<sub>3</sub> exposures averaged from birth to age 8 and lung function in middle childhood."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
