These changes have been computed parametrically for mixing fractions of water vapor between 3 x 10(-6) and 6.5 x 10(-6). With added water from the exhausts of projected fleets of stratospheric aircraft, the ozone column may diminish by 3.8 percent, the transmitted solar power increase by 0.07 percent, and the surface temperature rise by 0.04 degrees K in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to a cancellation of terms, temperatures in the lower stratosphere remain essentially unchanged. These results are sensitive to the form of the water profile and emphasize the potential role of convective transients near 30 kilometers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harrison", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1970", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1970", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17776339", "10.1126/science.170.3959.734", "170/3959/734"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
