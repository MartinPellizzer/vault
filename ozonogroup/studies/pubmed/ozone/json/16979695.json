Degradations and mineralizations of 0.045mM 2,4-D using O(3), O(3)/UV, UV/TiO(2) and O(3)/UV/TiO(2) systems were compared, and influence of reaction temperature on the mineralization in O(3)/UV/TiO(2) system was investigated. 2,4-D degradations by O(3), O(3)/UV and UV/TiO(2) systems were similar to the results of earlier investigations with higher 2,4-D concentrations. The degradations and total organic carbon (TOC) removals in the four systems were well described by the first-order reaction kinetics. The degradation and removal were greatly enhanced in O(3)/UV/TiO(2) system, and further enhancements were observed with larger O(3) supplies. The enhancements were attributed to hydroxyl radical (()OH) generation from more than one reaction pathway. The degradation and removal in O(3)/UV/TiO(2) system were very efficient with reaction temperature fixed at 20 degrees C. It was suspected that reaction temperature might have influenced ()OH generation in the system, which needs further attention."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New Industrial R&D Center, Osaka Sangyo University, 3-1-1 Nakagaito, Daito City, 574-8530 Osaka, Japan. sn04001@sub.osaka-sandai.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giri", "ForeName": "Rabindra Raj", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishida", "ForeName": "Takehiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takanami", "ForeName": "Ryohei", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taniguchi", "ForeName": "Shogo", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16979695", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.08.007", "S0045-6535(06)01090-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
