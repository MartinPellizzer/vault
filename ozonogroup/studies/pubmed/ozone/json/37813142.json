Multiple studies have demonstrated that these measures successfully reduced the levels of air pollutants except for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). However, the potential risks of nationwide O<sub>3</sub> changes during this period remain uncertain. To address this gap, we evaluated the ecological and health effects of O<sub>3</sub> using hourly O<sub>3</sub> data from 1 January to 17 June in both 2020 and 2019. Our results indicated that all health and ecological indicators, except SUM06 (sum of all hourly O<sub>3</sub> over 60\u00a0ppb), during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased most obviously in Stages 2 and 3 with the strictest control measures, compared to the same period in 2019. The national premature deaths due to short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure during Stages 2-3 in 2020 totaled 146,558 (95% CI: 79,386-213,730) for all non-accidental causes and 82,408 (95% CI: 30,522-134,295) for cardiovascular diseases, increasing by 18.78% and 18.76% in 2019, respectively. The most significant increase in health risks occurred in Hubei, followed by Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shaanxi. In addition, the estimated national winter wheat production losses (WWPL) attributable to O<sub>3</sub> amounted to 50.6 and 51.1 million metric tons for 2019 and 2020, respectively. Among the major winter wheat-producing provinces, Anhui and Jiangsu experienced a larger increase in WWPL, while Shandong and Hebei suffered a greater decrease in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting in little overall change in WWPL between the two years. These findings provided direct evidence of the harmful effects of O<sub>3</sub> during the COVID-19 pandemic and serve as a valuable reference for future air pollution control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
