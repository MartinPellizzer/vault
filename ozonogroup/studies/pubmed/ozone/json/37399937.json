This study investigated whether near-ambient O<sub>3</sub> is suppressive or conducive to stem rust (Sr) of wheat, considering the interactions with ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Winter wheat variety 'Coker 9553' (Sr-susceptible; O<sub>3</sub> sensitive) was inoculated with Sr (race QFCSC) following pre-treatment with four different concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> (CF, 50, 70, and 90\u00a0ppbv) at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Gas treatments were continued during the development of disease symptoms. Disease severity, measured as percent sporulation area (PSA), significantly increased relative to the CF control only under near-ambient O<sub>3</sub> conditions (50\u00a0ppbv) in the absence of O<sub>3</sub>-induced foliar injury. Disease symptoms at higher O<sub>3</sub> exposures (70 and 90\u00a0ppbv) were similar to or less than the CF control. When Coker 9553 was inoculated with Sr while exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> (400; 570 ppmv) and O<sub>3</sub> (CF; 50\u00a0ppbv) in four different combinations, and seven combinations of exposure timing and duration, PSA significantly increased only under continuous treatment with O<sub>3</sub> for six weeks or pre-inoculation treatment for three weeks, suggesting that O<sub>3</sub>-predisposes wheat to the disease rather than enhancing disease post-inoculation. O<sub>3</sub> singly and in combination with CO<sub>2</sub> increased PSA on flag leaves of adult Coker 9553 plants while elevated CO<sub>2</sub> alone had little effect on PSA. These findings show that sub-symptomatic O<sub>3</sub> conditions are conducive to stem rust, contradicting the current consensus that biotrophic pathogens are suppressed by elevated O<sub>3</sub>. This suggests that sub-symptomatic O<sub>3</sub> stress may enhance rust diseases in wheat-growing regions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA; Department of Plant Pathology, Faculty of Agriculture, Damanhour University, Damanhour, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mashaheet", "ForeName": "Alsayed M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA-ARS, Plant Science Research Unit, Raleigh, NC, USA.
