The contribution of weather shifts to O<sub>3</sub> concentration variability owing to climate change remains elusive. By combining regional air chemistry model simulations with near-surface observations, we found that anthropogenic emission changes contributed to approximately 23% of the increase in maximum daily 8-h average O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the BTH region in June-July-August (JJA) 2017 (compared with that in 2013). With respect to the weather shift influence, the frequencies, durations, and magnitudes of O<sub>3</sub> exceedance were consistent with those of the heat wave events in the BTH region during JJA in 2013-2017. Intensified heat waves are a significant driver for worsening O<sub>3</sub> pollution. In particular, the prolonged duration of heat waves creates consecutive adverse weather conditions that cause O<sub>3</sub> accumulation and severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Our results suggest that the variability in extreme summer heat is closely related to the occurrence of high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, which is a significant driver of deteriorating O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
