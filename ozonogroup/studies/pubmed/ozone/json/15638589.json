The assignment is based on intensities calculated with three-dimensional vibrational wave functions for the electronic ground state (X) and the excited state (B). The hot-band structures in the 218 K spectrum all can be assigned to transitions starting from vibrational states with one quantum of stretching excitation in the ground electronic state. The 295 K spectrum shows new structures, which are due to transitions originating from vibrational states in the X state with two quanta of excitation of the stretching modes--despite very small Boltzmann factors. All structures in the low-energy range of the 295 K spectrum, even the very weak ones, thus can be uniquely interpreted. The significance of hot bands results from the strong increase of Franck-Condon factors with excitation of the stretching modes in both the lower and/or the upper electronic states, whose equilibrium bond lengths differ significantly."], "CopyrightInformation": "2005 American Institute of Physics."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Str\u00f6mungsforschung, D-37073 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Z-W", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grebenshchikov", "ForeName": "S Yu", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schinke", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malicet", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brion", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daumont", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15638589", "10.1063/1.1825380"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
