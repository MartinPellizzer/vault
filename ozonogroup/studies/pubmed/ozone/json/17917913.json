During the exposure period, the experimental animals were sacrificed after 2 h and 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of exposure; then sections were examined using lectin histochemistry. Some remarkable changes, such as destroyed cilia, desquamation and mucification of epithelial cells, and destruction of nasal septal glands, were seen in the welding fume-exposed groups. Specific changes in the lectin binding patterns were also observed in the welding fume-exposed rats. The Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) staining of the cilia and columnar cells increased slightly when compared with the unexposed rats. The RCA-I and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I) staining of the goblet cells also increased as the exposure continued. The mucigenous epithelial cells reacted with Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin-I (BSL-I), RCA-I, and succinylated wheat germ agglutinin A (sWGA) after 15 days of exposure, which was not visible in the control group. The dorsal septal glands exhibited an affinity with peanut agglutinin (PNA), BSL-I, and RCA-I, which was also not visible in the control group. The affinity for Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), soybean agglutinin (SBA), PNA, sWGA, BSL-I, and UEA-I in the ventral septal glands of the welding fume-exposed groups tended to increase, whereas the concanavalin A (Con A) reactivity in the dorsal septal glands decreased slightly. In conclusion, it was assumed that the changes in the glycoconjugate residues in the nasal respiratory mucosa of the welding fume-exposed rats represented important components of defense mechanisms against the toxicants in the welding fumes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Science Education, College of Education, Pusan National University, Geumjeong-gu, Busan, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Gil Nam", "Initials": "GN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "Un Bock", "Initials": "UB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Il Je", "Initials": "IJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12597-68-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Stainless Steel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants, Occupational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stainless Steel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Welding"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17917913", "10.1080/08958370701533491", "782798741"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
