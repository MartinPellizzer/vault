However, little is known about the role of synergetic relationship between porous architecture and active site exposure of Fe-MOFs on catalysis for AOPs yet. Here, we demonstrated an overlooked compromise over these two features on modulating the catalytic ozonation reactivity of MIL-53(Fe) through a timescale-dependent crystal evolution. Enabled by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the MIL-53(Fe) was subjected to six evolution steps in terms of crystal morphology, leading to a volcano plot of catalytic ozonation reactivity for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation versus the crystallization time. Evidence suggested that the surface area of MIL-53(Fe) decreased dramatically, while the density of accessible active site increased when prolonging crystallization time, allowing for the facile modulation of catalytic ozonation reactivity of MIL-53(Fe). Electron paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence quantification tests verified that the screened MIL-53(Fe)s had a much better capacity for \u2219OH generation than benchmark ozonation catalyst \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> and \u03b1-FeOOH. Moreover, the MIL-53(Fe) with the highest reactivity (i.e., MIL-53(Fe)-18H) could effectively destruct a broad spectrum of emerging and refractory organic pollutants and allow the thorough purification of secondary effluents discharged from textile dyeing & finishing industry for in situ reuse. Therefore, our study advances the understanding of the compromise effect between porous architecture and active site on catalysis reactivity of Fe-MOFs and promotes the rational design of more effective Fe-MOFs as well as their derivatives for environmental applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
