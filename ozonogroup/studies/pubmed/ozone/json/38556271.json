Few studies have examined the relationship between sensory processing patterns and emotions, or their effects on daily life. We investigated the relationship between sensory processing patterns and emotional/behavioral problems in children with ASD.", "A retrospective chart review was conducted. Forty-three children with ASD (33 boys, 10 girls, median age 9 years) in the outpatient clinic of a psychiatric hospital participated; their parent (s) were invited to complete the Sensory Profile 2 (SP2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires. The participants' teachers were invited to complete the Teacher's Report Form (TRF).", "In the correlation analyses, each of the four quadrants of the SP2 (low registration, sensory seeking, hypersensitivity, and sensory avoiding) had significant positive correlations with different types of emotional and behavioral problems measured by the CBCL. Focusing on emotion, 'anxious/depressed' was correlated with low registration (r = 0.41) and sensory avoiding (r = 0.60), while 'withdrawal/depressed' was correlated with sensory avoiding (r = 0.46). Only one significant correlation was revealed between the SP2 and the TRF.", "Our results suggest a link between sensory processing patterns and emotional/behavioral problems. In school settings, the relationship between sensory processing patterns and emotional/behavioral problems may be easily overlooked."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "St. Lucia Hospital."}], "LastName": "Sakamoto", "ForeName": "Nao", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kurume University Health Service Center."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Oe", "ForeName": "Misari", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Ozone", "ForeName": "Motohiro", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kurume Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "2985210R", "ISSNLinking": "0023-5679"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Autism Spectrum Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emotions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensation"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Problem Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38556271", "10.2739/kurumemedj.MS7012002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
