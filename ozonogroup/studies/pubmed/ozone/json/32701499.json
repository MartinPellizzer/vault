The effluents from wastewater treatment plants and livestock production are major sources of ARB and ARGs. Chlorination, UV irradiation, and ozone disinfection cannot remove ARGs completely. In this study, the potential of electrochemical oxidation and electro-Fenton processes as alternative treatment technologies for inactivation of ARB and ARGs in both intracellular and extracellular forms was evaluated. Results showed that the electrochemical oxidation process was effective for the inactivation of selected ARB but not for the removal of intracellular ARGs or extracellular ARGs. The electro-Fenton process was more effective for the removal of both intracellular and extracellular ARGs. The removal efficiency after 120 min of electro-Fenton treatment under 21.42 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> was 3.8 logs for intracellular tetA, 4.1 logs for intracellular ampC, 5.2 logs for extracellular tetA, and 4.8 logs for extracellular ampC, respectively in the presence of 1.0 mmol/L Fe<sup>2+</sup>. It is suggested that electrochemical oxidation is an effective disinfection method for ARB and the electro-Fenton process is a promising technology for the removal of both intracellular and extracellular ARGs in wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering of Nanjing Forestry University, Longpan Road 159, Nanjing 210037, China E-mail: chenlei_njfu@163.com; Key Laboratory of Water Pollution Control and Environmental Safety of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Science and Engineering, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, Suzhou 215009, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering and School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Zhi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China; Key Laboratory of Water Pollution Control and Environmental Safety of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Chaofeng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil Engineering of Nanjing Forestry University, Longpan Road 159, Nanjing 210037, China E-mail: chenlei_njfu@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yilu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32701499", "10.2166/wst.2020.282"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
