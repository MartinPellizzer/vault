However, only limited information is known about low-level ozone's influence on the respiratory system. In the present study, we systematically investigated the degradation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), which is one of the major components of the pulmonary surfactant (PS), enabling breath function of the lung exposed to low ambient-level ozone (40 \u00b1 10 ppb). Using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique combined with the Langmuir-Blodgett approach, we first tracked the degradation process of POPC molecules by determining the degradation products during exposure to the ambient environment. As a result, we found that the POPC molecules can be readily degraded from the C\u2550C moiety in 45 min, yielding an aldehyde-type product of 1-palmitoyl-2-(9'-oxo-nonanoyl)-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POnPC) and a trace amount of an acid-type one of 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAzPC), as well as a pair of secondary ozonide (SOZ) isomers. Furthermore, with prolonged exposure, the SOZ stayed constant but the yield of PAzPC significantly increased with the decrease in POnPC. The low-level ozone-induced oxidation mechanisms for unsaturated lipids are discussed based on the quantitative analyses of these experimental observations. The present results demonstrate that the ground-level ozone is strong enough to induce dramatic oxidation damage to the unsaturated lipids of the PS. These oxidized species may trigger the lung's inflammatory response and be used as biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5339-2499"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takada", "ForeName": "Chunji", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Sapporo University of Health Sciences, Sapporo 007-0894, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chiba", "ForeName": "Hitoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6237-6618"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Ken-Ichi", "Initials": "KI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9973-6461"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Shu-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0090-7855"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Elements Strategy Initiative for Catalysts and Batteries (ESICB), Kyoto University, Kyoto 615-8520, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Shen", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35605232", "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00576"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
