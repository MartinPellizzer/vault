The commercial product \"Pilkington Active\u2122 glass\" was used as the immobilized TiO(2) photocatalyst and it was irradiated by near UV light in this study. The synergistic interaction between ozone and the photoactivated TiO(2) surface was discussed and highlighted. Furthermore, the influences of initial concentration and temperature on the degradation rate of dichloroacetic acid and the ozone consumption level during the oxidation process were investigated. The concentrations of dichloroacetic acid and chloride anions produced during degradation were measured using ion chromatography. The mineralization of dichloroacetic acid was evaluated by Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements. The degradation of dichloroacetic acid by photocatalytic ozonation showed good agreement with the kinetics of first-order reactions with respect to dichloroacetic acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Soil, Water and Air, Faculty of Environmental Science and Process Engineering, Brandenburg University of Technology, Germany. m_mehr1356@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehrjouei", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Siegfried", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00f6ller", "ForeName": "Detlev", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9LSH52S3LQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Dichloroacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dichloroacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22506699", "10.1080/10934529.2012.668026"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
