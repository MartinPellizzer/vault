Karst.) at a Mg-deficient and ozone polluted mountain site (Sch\u00f6llkopf mountain, Central Black Forest, Germany, 840 m a.s.l.). While at an early stage of yellowing the chlorophyll (Chl) content of the needles decreased slowly, significant changes occurred in the chloroplasts: The lability of the light-harvesting Chl a/b protein complex LHC II increased; the thylakoid cross-sectional area of chloroplasts in the outer mesophyll of the needles decreased, and their Chl fluorescence showed typical changes like the decrease of Fv/Fm and the increase of the photoinhibitory Fv quenching. Later on, the Chl content decreased rapidly, the changes in the chloroplasts continued and the needles turned yellow. Lutein and the pigments of the xanthophyll cycle were enhanced in relation to Chl a. Light and dark reactions of the xanthophyll cycle were highly active indicating efficient proton pumping and NADPH formation. The ratio of nonappressed to appressed thylakoid membranes increased with decreasing Fv/Fm suggesting that structural and fluorescence properties of the chloroplasts were related. The response of the needles to defined shading and improved Mg supply was also examined. The combined effects of strong sun light, low levels of non-Chl-bound Mg (Mg(free)) and ozone concentrations exceeding 80 microg m(-3) are shown to be necessary to induce the rapid yellowing process. For needles with Mg(free) < 0.12 mg g(-1) needle dry matter, the lability of the LHC II was correlated with the ozone concentration suggesting that the destabilization of the LHC II plays a central role in the rapid yellowing process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe (TH), Botanisches Institut I, Kaiserstr. 12, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany. dorothea.harms@imb.fzk.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siefermann-Harms", "ForeName": "Dorothea", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boxler-Baldoma", "ForeName": "Carmen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Wilpert", "ForeName": "Klaus", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heumann", "ForeName": "Hans-G\u00fcnther", "Initials": "HG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882059", "ISSNLinking": "0176-1617"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Picea"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15128030", "10.1078/0176-1617-01095", "S0176-1617(04)70604-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
