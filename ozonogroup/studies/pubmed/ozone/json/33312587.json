Oxyhalides is one amongst the foremost important by-products in bottled water which is produced by disinfection process such as \"ozonation\". International standards have been set and justified to permissible levels for chlorate, chlorite and bromate as 700, 700 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/l. Thereafter, 168 samples of bottled water (mineral and drinking water) from Iran market obtained with the optimal working conditions and analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) with conductivity detector. The results actuated that 23 and 17 out of 168 samples as mineral and drinking water revealed bromate content in charge of the national permissible level, found as the mean level of 37.04 and 33.58\u00a0\u03bcg/l, respectively. According to risk assessment results, the average of hazard quotient (HQ) and lifetime excess cancer (ELCR) were calculated 6.955\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-3</sup> and 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Thereupon, it is indispensable to control as well as make consumers aware of oxyholides hazard especially bromate following governmental authorities with an insight to health sectors monitoring guidelines due to its obvious harmful effects and aspects on health issues."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411463.5", "0000 0001 0706 2472"], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, South Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Djam", "ForeName": "Sima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411536.4", "0000 0000 9504 7215"], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Imam Hossein University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.466618.b", "0000 0004 0405 6503"], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Hamid", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5685-1213"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.415814.d", "0000 0004 0612 272X"], "Affiliation": "Food and Drug Laboratory Research Center (FDLRC), Iran Food and Drug Administration (IFDA), Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shoeibi", "ForeName": "Shahram", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Health Sci Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101613643"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Rodwan JG.
