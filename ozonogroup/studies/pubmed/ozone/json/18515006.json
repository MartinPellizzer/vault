Phytotoxicity and the inhibitory effects on the microbial activity of the raw and the ozonated solutions were also carried out with the aim of water reuse and environment protection. Decolorization of the aqueous solutions, disappearance of the parent compound, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal were the main parameters monitored in this study. To control the mineralization of the Congo red, pH of the ozonated solution and heteroatoms released from the mother molecule such NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) were determined. It was concluded that ozone by itself is strong enough to decolorize these aqueous solutions in the early stage of the oxidation process. Nonetheless, efficient mineralization had not been achieved. Significant drops in COD (54%) were registered. The extent of TOC removal was about 32%. Sulfur heteroatom was totally oxidized to SO(4)(2-) ions while the central -NN- azo ring was partially converted to NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-). Results of the kinetic studies showed that ozonation of the selected molecule was a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to dye concentration. The obtained results also demonstrate that ozone process reduced the phytotoxicity of the raw solution and enhanced the biodegradability of the treated azo-dyes-wastewater. Hence, this show that ozone remains one of the effective technologies for the discoloration and the detoxification of organic dyes in wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire 3E, Eau, Energie et Environnement, ENIS BP-W, 3038 Sfax, Tunisia. montunisia@yahoo.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khadhraoui", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trabelsi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ksibi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bouguerra", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elleuch", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3U05FHG59S", "NameOfSubstance": "Congo Red"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Congo Red"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18515006", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.04.060", "S0304-3894(08)00585-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
