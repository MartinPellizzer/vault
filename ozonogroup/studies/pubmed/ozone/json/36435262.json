Wastewater treatment methods aimed at reuse/recycle of fracking wastewater can help reduce water stress of the fracking process. Accordingly, this study assessed the catalytic performance and life cycle environmental impacts of cerium-based mixed oxide catalysts for catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) of organic contaminants, in order to investigate their potential as catalysts for fracking wastewater treatment. For these purposes, MnCeO<sub>x</sub> and CuCeO<sub>x</sub> were tested for phenol removal in the presence of concentrated NaCl (200 g L<sup>-1</sup>), which represented a synthetic fracking wastewater. Removal of phenol in pure (\"phenolic\") water without NaCl was also considered for comparison. Complete (100 %) phenol and a 94 % total organic carbon (TOC) removal were achieved in both the phenolic and fracking wastewaters by utilising MnCeO<sub>x</sub> (5 g L<sup>-1</sup>) and insignificant metal leaching was observed. However, a much lower activity was observed when the same amount of CuCeO<sub>x</sub> was utilised: 23.3 % and 20.5 % for phenol and TOC removals, respectively, in the phenolic, and 69.1 % and 63 % in the fracking wastewater. Furthermore, severe copper leaching from CuCeO<sub>x</sub> was observed during stability tests conducted in the fracking wastewater. A life cycle assessment (LCA) study carried out as part of this work showed that the production of MnCeO<sub>x</sub> had 12-98 % lower impacts than CuCeO<sub>x</sub> due to the higher impacts of copper than manganese precursors. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of CWO were found to be 94-99 % lower than those of ozonation due to lower energy and material requirements. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the adoption of catalytic treatment would improve both the efficiency and the environmental sustainability of both the fracking wastewater treatment and the fracking process as a whole."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
