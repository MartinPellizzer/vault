The interaction between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and its contribution to disease burden associated with co-pollution has not been thoroughly examined. We collected data on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases from a city-wide hospital discharge database in Beijing between 2013 and 2019. City-wide 24-h mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> and daily maximum 8-h mean O<sub>3</sub> were averaged from 35 monitoring stations across Beijing. Conditional Poisson regression was employed to estimate the interaction between warm-season PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on respiratory admissions. A model incorporating a tensor product term was used to fit the non-linear interaction and estimate the number of respiratory admissions attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution. From January 18, 2013 to December 31, 2019, 1,191,308 respiratory admissions were recorded. We observed multiplicative interactions between warm-season PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on upper respiratory infections (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), pneumonia (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P\u00a0=\u00a00.041), and total respiratory disease (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). PM<sub>2.5</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> co-pollution during warm season exhibited a super-additive effect on respiratory admissions, with a relative excess risk due to interaction of 1.65% (95%CI: 0.46%-2.84%). There was a non-linear pattern of the synergistic effect between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on respiratory admissions. Based on the World Health Organization global air quality guidelines, 12,421 respiratory admissions would be reduced if both daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations had not exceeded the target (PM<sub>2.5</sub> 15\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, O<sub>3</sub> 100\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). The number of respiratory admissions attributable to either PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> pollution decreased by 48.7% from 2013 to 2019. Prioritizing O<sub>3</sub> control during the warm season is a cost-effective strategy for Beijing. These findings underscore the significance of concurrently addressing both PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution and O<sub>3</sub> pollution during the warm season to alleviate the burden of respiratory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
