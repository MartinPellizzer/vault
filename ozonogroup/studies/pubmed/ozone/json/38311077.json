This study constructed the transport networks of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in different seasons from 2017 to 2020. The transport trends and the clustering formation patterns were summarized by analyzing the topological characteristics of the transport networks, and the patterns of OFS changes were diagnosed by analyzing the satellite remote sensing data. Based on that, the main clusters that each province or city belongs to in different pollutant transport networks were summarized and proposals for the inter-regional joint prevention and control were put forward. As the results showed, O<sub>3</sub> transport activity was most active in spring and summer and least active in winter, while NO<sub>2</sub> transport activity was most active in autumn and winter and least active in summer. OFS in summer mainly consisted of transitional regimes and NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regimes, while that in other seasons was mainly VOC-limited regimes. Notably, there was a significant upward trend in the proportion of transitional regimes and NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regimes in spring, autumn, and winter. For regions showing NO<sub>x</sub>-limited regime, areas with higher out-weighted degrees in the NO<sub>2</sub> transport network should focus on controlling local NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, such as central regions in summer. For regions showing VOC-limited regime, areas with higher out-weighted degrees in the O<sub>3</sub> transport network should focus on controlling local VOCs emissions, such as central and south-central regions in summer. For regions that belong to the same cluster and present the same OFS in each specific season, regional cooperative emission reduction strategies should be established to block important transmission paths and weaken regional pollution consistency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
