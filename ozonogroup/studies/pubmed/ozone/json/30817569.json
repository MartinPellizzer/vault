Occupational exposure to HCFC-123 may cause mild reversible hepatoxicity, but no fatal cases have been reported yet.", "In this report, we present cases of severe hepatitis with fatal outcome by HCFC-123. Two industrial workers from a manufacturing factory of fire extinguishers which use HCFC-123 were presented with diarrhea, fever, myalgia, and jaundice. Patients had been repeatedly exposed to the liquid form of HCFC-123 for the past three weeks before flare of symptoms.", "The blood biochemistry tests showed acute cholestatic hepatitis and liver biopsy findings indicated inflammatory hepatocellular injury. The diagnosis of HCFC-123 induced hepatitis was made.", "The treatment for both patients were generally supportive. The second patient went through hemodialysis, ventilatory care, and artificial liver support therapy (molecular adsorbent recirculating system) at intensive care unit.", "One patient recovered uneventfully, whereas the other patient showed rapid deterioration leading to acute liver failure complicated with cerebral edema, subdural hemorrhage, and death on hospital day 10.", "The HCFC-123-induced hepatitis showed similarities with halothane hepatitis, both of which may share pathophysiologic mechanisms.
