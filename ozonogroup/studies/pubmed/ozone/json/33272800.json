Thus, few vegetation models can accurately simulate the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on WUE. Here, we conducted an experiment exposing two differently O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive species (Cotinus coggygria and Magnolia denudata) to five O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and investigated the impact of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on predicted WUE using a coupled A<sub>n</sub>-g<sub>s</sub> model. We found that increases in stomatal O<sub>3</sub> uptake caused linear reductions in the maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation (V<sub>cmax</sub>) and electron transport (J<sub>max</sub>) in both species. In addition, a negative linear correlation between O<sub>3</sub>-induced changes in the minimal g<sub>s</sub> of the stomatal model (g<sub>0</sub>) derived from the theory of optimal stomatal behavior and light-saturated photosynthesis was found in the O<sub>3</sub>-sensitive M.\u00a0denudata. When the O<sub>3</sub> dose-based responses of V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> were included in a coupled A<sub>n</sub>-g<sub>s</sub> model, simulated A<sub>n</sub> under elevated O<sub>3</sub> were in good agreement with observations in both species. For M.\u00a0denudata, incorporating the O<sub>3</sub> response of g<sub>0</sub> into the coupled model further improved the accuracy of the simulated g<sub>s</sub> and WUE. In conclusion, the modified V<sub>cmax</sub>, J<sub>max</sub> and g<sub>0</sub> method presented here provides a foundation for improving the prediction for O<sub>3</sub>-induced changes in A<sub>n</sub>, g<sub>s</sub> and WUE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
