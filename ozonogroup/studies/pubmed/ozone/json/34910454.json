Emissions of ROC fuel atmospheric oxidation chemistry to produce secondary pollutants including ozone, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter. Compared to the outdoor atmosphere, the indoor organic carbon budget is comparatively understudied. We characterized indoor ROC in a test house during unoccupied, cooking, and cleaning scenarios using various online mass spectrometry and gas chromatography measurements of gaseous and particulate organics. Cooking greatly impacted indoor ROC concentrations and bulk physicochemical properties (e.g., volatility and oxidation state), while cleaning yielded relatively insubstantial changes. Additionally, cooking enhanced the reactivities of hydroxyl radicals and ozone toward indoor ROC. We observed consistently higher median ROC concentrations indoors (\u2265223 \u03bcg C m<sup>-3</sup>) compared to outdoors (54 \u03bcg C m<sup>-3</sup>), demonstrating that buildings can be a net source of reactive carbon to the outdoor atmosphere, following its removal by ventilation. We estimate the unoccupied test house emitted 0.7 g C day<sup>-1</sup> from ROC to outdoors. Indoor ROC emissions may thus play an important role in air quality and secondary pollutant formation outdoors, particularly in urban and suburban areas, and indoors during the use of oxidant-generating air purifiers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3152-5144"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Mattila", "ForeName": "James M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0170-8794"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Arata", "ForeName": "Caleb", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Abeleira", "ForeName": "Andrew", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9565-8777"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3726-1808"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Katz", "ForeName": "Erin F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4014-4896"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}], "LastName": "Goldstein", "ForeName": "Allen H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3372-334X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H6, Canada."}], "LastName": "Abbatt", "ForeName": "Jonathan P D", "Initials": "JPD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6385-7149"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, United States."}], "LastName": "DeCarlo", "ForeName": "Peter F", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0940-0353"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309, United States."}], "LastName": "Vance", "ForeName": "Marina E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6470-9970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, United States."}], "LastName": "Farmer", "ForeName": "Delphine K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34910454", "10.1021/acs.est.1c03915"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
