Participants were recruited from 22 US sites between September 2016 and January 2022. Data from baseline and three follow-ups were included.", "Area-level geocoded variables spanning various domains of SDOH, including socioeconomic status (SES), education, crime, built environment, social context, and crime, were clustered using a self-organizing map method to identify exposure profiles.", "Persistent distressing PLE was derived from the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child Version across four years. Generalized linear mixed modeling tested the association between exposure profiles and persistent distressing PLE as well as physical activities (i.e., team and individual sports), adjusting for individual-level covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, highest level of parent education, family-relatedness, and study sites.", "Among 8,145 participants (baseline mean [SD] age, 9.92 [0.63] years; 3,868 (47.5%) females; 5,566 (68.3%) White, 956 (11.7%) Black, 159 (2.0%) Asian, and 1,480 (18.4%) Hispanic participants), five exposure profiles were identified.
