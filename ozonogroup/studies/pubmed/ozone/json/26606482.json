While ozone is one of the most reactive 1,3-dipoles, SO2 does not react in this way at all. The activation energies of dipolar cycloadditions of sulfur dioxide with either ethylene or acetylene are predicted here by B3LYP, M06-2X, CBS-QB3, and CCSD(T) to be much higher than reactions of ozone. The dipolar cycloaddition of ozone is very exothermic, while that of than sulfur dioxide is endothermic. The prohibitive barriers in the case of SO2 arise from large distortion energies as well as unfavorable interaction energies in the transition states. This arises in part from the HOMO-LUMO gap of sulfur dioxide, which is larger than that of ozone. Valence bond calculations also show that while ozone has a high degree of diradical character, SO2 does not, and is better characterized as a dritterion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California-Los Angeles , Los Angeles, California 90095-1569, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University , College Station, Texas 77843, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "Steven E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California-Los Angeles , Los Angeles, California 90095-1569, United States."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houk", "ForeName": "K N", "Initials": "KN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Theory Comput", "NlmUniqueID": "101232704", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9618"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26606482", "10.1021/ct200293w"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
