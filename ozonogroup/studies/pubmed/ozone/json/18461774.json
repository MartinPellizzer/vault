Some of the specifics include source water quality, storage capacity, existing unit process, and space. An overview of the US recreational and drinking water regulations were discussed in context of cyanobacterial toxin removal and inactivation by ancillary as well as auxiliary treatment practices. Ancillary practice refers to the removal or inactivation of algal toxins by standard daily operational procedures where auxiliary treatment practice refers to intentional treatment. An example of auxiliary treatment would be the addition of powder activated carbon to remove taste and odor compounds. The implementation of new technologies as such ultraviolet disinfection and membrane filtration, to meet current and purposed regulations, can greatly affect the algal toxin removal and inactivation efficiencies. A discussion on meeting the current regulations by altering chemical disinfection, ozone, chlorine, chloramines and chlorine dioxide included their ancillary effects on the protection against algal toxins. Although much of the research has been on the efficiency of the removal and inactivation of microcystin LR and several microcystin variants, the discussion included other algal toxins: anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, and cyclindrospermopsin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lake Superior State University, USA. jwestrick@lssu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Westrick", "ForeName": "Judy A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Marine Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Microcystins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanobacteria Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Marine Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Microcystins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recreation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18461774", "10.1007/978-0-387-75865-7_13"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
