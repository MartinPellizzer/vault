Spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence excitation/emission spectroscopy were demonstrated to offer the potential for monitoring OMPs removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants or ozonation pilots but their application to activated carbon (AC) adsorption processes was only investigated at lab scale and not in real treatment facilities. In this study, indexes from fluorescence emission/excitation matrices (EEMs) were used to find correlations with the removal of 28 OMPs from a large-scale AC pilot in fluidized bed employed for wastewater advanced treatment, as well as from batch experiments. Differences in OMPs removal could be observed depending on the operational conditions (i.e. pilot or batch experiments, contact time, type of AC) and the physico-chemical properties of the molecules. 7 PARAFAC components were derived from the fluorescence EEMs of 60 samples obtained before and after adsorption. Positive correlations were obtained between the removal of fluorescence indexes and most OMPs, and correlation coefficients were much higher than the ones obtained with UV<sub>254</sub>, confirming the interesting potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to accurately monitor adsorption performances at the industrial scale. The highest correlation coefficients were obtained for OMPs having the best removals while the ones that were refractory to adsorption, as well as to interactions with DOM, exhibited weak correlations. These results suggest that interactions between OMPs and fluorescing DOM and their subsequent co-adsorption onto AC were at the origin of the correlations found. Lower correlations were also found for the most biodegradable OMPs, which indicated that the occurrence of biological effects could make the monitoring of these compounds more challenging."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
