Ozonation of drinking water, which previously has only been possible at large centralized facilities, can now be accomplished on a small-scale using microplasma technology. The efficacy of decentralized solar-powered drinking water treatment systems has not previously been described. <b>Methods:</b> We established a 1,000L decentralized solar-powered water treatment system located in Kisumu County, Kenya. Highly contaminated surface water is pumped to the treatment system, which includes flocculation and filtration steps prior to ozonation. Turbidity, total coliform bacteria, and <i>E. coli</i> were measured at various stages of water treatment, and bacterial log reduction values (LRVs) were calculated. <b>Results:</b> Forty-seven trials were conducted in which1000L of water were flocculated, filtered, and ozonated for 180 minutes. Baseline turbidity and <i>E. coli</i> concentrations were reduced from a median of 238 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and 2,419.7 most probable number/100mL, respectively, in surface water to 1.0 NTU and undetectable <i>E. coli</i> after ozonation for 180 minutes. The median <i>E. coli</i> LRV was 3.99. <b>Conclusions:</b> The solar-powered, decentralized water treatment system that utilizes ozonation for disinfection was founded to reduce <i>E. coli</i> by more than 3 log-orders of magnitude despite the high turbidity of the raw water. Further research is needed to characterize limitations, scalability, economic viability, and community perspectives that could help determine the role for similar systems in other settings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Hendrickson C et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8347-357X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA."}], "LastName": "Hendrickson", "ForeName": "Colin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), Kisumu, 3323-40100, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Oremo", "ForeName": "Jared", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), Kisumu, 3323-40100, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Akello", "ForeName": "Oscar Oluoch", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), Kisumu, 3323-40100, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Bunde", "ForeName": "Simon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), Kisumu, 3323-40100, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Rayola", "ForeName": "Isaac", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shemjen Engineering, Nairobi, 23697-00100, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Akello", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shemjen Engineering, Nairobi, 23697-00100, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Akwiri", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9260-0091"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sung-Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1847-1316"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Environmental Science and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA."}], "LastName": "Dorevitch", "ForeName": "Samuel", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Gates Open Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101717821", "ISSNLinking": "2572-4754"}, "CoiStatement": "Competing interests: S.
