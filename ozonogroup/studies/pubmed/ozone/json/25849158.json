The nonthermal technologies discussed in this review have the potential to meet industry and consumer expectations. However, the lack of standardization in operating conditions hampers comparisons among different studies, and consequently ambiguity arises within the literature. For the juice industry to advance, more detailed studies are needed on the scaling-up, process design, and optimization, as well as on the effect of such technologies on juice quality of juices in order to maximize their potential as alternative nonthermal technologies in fruit-juice processing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Analytical Chemistry , University of Granada , Granada , Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research and Development of Functional Food Centre (CIDAF), PTS Granada , Granada , Spain."}], "LastName": "Jim\u00e9nez-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Cecilia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Analytical Chemistry , University of Granada , Granada , Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research and Development of Functional Food Centre (CIDAF), PTS Granada , Granada , Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences , Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy."}], "LastName": "Lozano-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Jes\u00fas", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Analytical Chemistry , University of Granada , Granada , Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research and Development of Functional Food Centre (CIDAF), PTS Granada , Granada , Spain."}], "LastName": "Segura-Carretero", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Analytical Chemistry , University of Granada , Granada , Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Research and Development of Functional Food Centre (CIDAF), PTS Granada , Granada , Spain."}], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Guti\u00e9rrez", "ForeName": "Alberto", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit and Vegetable Juices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrostatic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25849158", "10.1080/10408398.2013.867828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
