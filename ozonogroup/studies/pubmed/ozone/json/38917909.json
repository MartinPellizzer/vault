This paper comprehensively reviews innovative microbial denitrification techniques for recovering N<sub>2</sub>O from nitrogenous wastewater and flue gas. Critical analysis is carried out on cutting-edge processes such as the coupled aerobic-anoxic nitrous decomposition operation (CANDO) process, semi-artificial photosynthesis, and the selective utilization of microbial strains, as well as flue gas absorption coupled with heterotrophic/autotrophic denitrification. These processes are highlighted for their potential to facilitate denitrification and enhance the recovery rate of N<sub>2</sub>O. The review integrates feasible methods for process control and optimization, and presents the underlying mechanisms for N<sub>2</sub>O recovery through denitrification, primarily achieved by suppressing nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) activity and intensifying competition for electron donors. The paper concludes by recognizing the shortcomings in existing technologies and proposing future research directions, with an emphasis on prioritizing the collection and utilization of N<sub>2</sub>O while considering environmental sustainability and economic feasibility. Through this review, we aim to inspire interest in the recovery and utilization of N<sub>2</sub>O, as well as the development and application of related technologies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
