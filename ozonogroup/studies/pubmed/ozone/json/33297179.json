This study investigated the toxicity and transformation characteristics of triclosan ozonation and chlorination. The results showed that two hydroxylated by-products were formed via nucleophilic substitution during ozonation, while three chlorinated compounds were generated via electrophilic substitution during chlorination. The toxicity results demonstrated that the parent compound, triclosan, exhibited mild genotoxicity and anti-estrogenic activity. The chlorination of triclosan resulted in a 30-fold increase in anti-estrogenic activity owing to the generation of toxic polychlorinated transformation by-products. In addition, the chlorination by-products were found to be genotoxic like the parent compound. Fortunately, in contrast to chlorination, ozonation could mitigate the genotoxicity and anti-estrogenic activity of triclosan-containing water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
