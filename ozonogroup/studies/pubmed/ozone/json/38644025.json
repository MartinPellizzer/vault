The results showed that an NTP-catalyzed system, especially using the CuMnTiO<sub>x</sub> catalyst, had better o-DCB degradation performance compared to plasma alone. The combination of the CuMnTiO<sub>x</sub> catalyst with NTP can achieve a degradation efficiency of up to 97.2% for o-DCB; the selectivity of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> and the carbon balance were 40%, 45%, and 85%, respectively. The dielectric constant and electrical property results indicated that the surface discharge capacity of the catalysts played a major role in the degradation of o-DCB, and a higher dielectric constant could suppress the plasma expansion and enhance the duration of the plasma discharge per discharge cycle. According to the O1s XPS and O<sub>2</sub>-TPD results, the conversion of CO to CO<sub>2</sub> follows the M-v-K mechanism; thus, the active species on the catalyst surface play an important role. Moreover, the CuMnTiO<sub>x</sub> and NTP mixed system exhibited excellent stability, which is probably because Cu doping improved the lifetime of the catalyst. This work can provide an experimental and theoretical basis for research in the degradation of o-DCB by plasma catalyst systems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
