In this study, Ag-modified manganese oxides (AgMnO<sub>x</sub>) were synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method. The effect of calcination temperature on the activity of MnO<sub>x</sub> and AgMnO<sub>x</sub> catalysts was investigated. The effect of the amount of Ag addition on the activity and structure of the catalysts was further studied by activity testing and characterization by a variety of techniques. The activity of 8%AgMnO<sub>x</sub> for ozone decomposition was significantly enhanced due to the formation of the Ag<sub>1.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> structure, indicating that this phase has excellent performance for ozone decomposition. The weight content of Ag<sub>1.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> in the 8%AgMnO<sub>x</sub> catalyst was only about 33.76%, which further indicates the excellent performance of the Ag<sub>1.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> phase for ozone decomposition. The H<sub>2</sub> temperature programmed reduction (H<sub>2</sub>-TPR) results indicated that the reducibility of the catalysts increased due to the formation of the Ag<sub>1.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub> structure. This study provides guidance for a follow-up study on Ag-modified manganese oxide catalysts for ozone decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
