Recently, it was found that the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family members, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in the DNA, is activated under high oxygen conditions by alpha ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG), a cofactor produced by aerobic metabolism in the citric acid cycle. TET, Jumonji-family histone demethylases, and prolyl hydroxylase, a repressor of HIF1\u03b1 under high oxygen conditions, all require alpha ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) as cofactors for their activation. The impact of the HIF1\u03b1 and TET proteins, which appear to have opposing functions, reaches several aspects of human life-including cell growth regulation, embryonic stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. The role of metabolism on regulating global DNA methylation and chromatin organization is recently demanding greater attention from the biomedical research community. This article will discuss the possible role of TET activation and the regulation of 5-hmC and 5-mC levels in response to environmental stress. We will also discuss how 5-hmC and 5-mC levels at the promoters of specific genes might be a useful biomarker for exposure to environmental toxins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chia", "ForeName": "Nancy", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Luan", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xiangyi", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Senut", "ForeName": "Mary-Claude", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brenner", "ForeName": "Carol", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruden", "ForeName": "Douglas M", "Initials": "DM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES012933", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R21 ES021983", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Epigenetics", "NlmUniqueID": "101265293", "ISSNLinking": "1559-2294"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1123-95-1", "NameOfSubstance": "5-hydroxymethylcytosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6R795CQT4H", "NameOfSubstance": "5-Methylcytosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8J337D1HZY", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.11.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Histone Demethylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "5-Methylcytosine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histone Demethylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21617369", "10.4161/epi.6.7.16461", "16461"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
