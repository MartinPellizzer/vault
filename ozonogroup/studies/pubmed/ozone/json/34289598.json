Observations reveal that during pollution episodes in autumn, fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations have not decreased, and particularly, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations have increased remarkably from 2013 to 2015 in Beijing. Additionally, a concurrence of O<sub>3</sub> and particulate pollution with high secondary aerosol contributions has been observed frequently, indicating high atmospheric oxidizing capacity (AOC) during particulate pollution. The WRF-Chem model simulations show elevated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and high fractions of oxygenated secondary aerosols (OSA) in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (0.53-0.73) during the severe pollution period. During daytime there exhibits an AOC-sufficient regime with the persistently high OSA fraction and an AOC-deficient regime with varied OSA fractions, separated by the O<sub>3</sub> level of 80\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup>. Our results suggest that increasing AOC can considerably weaken the emission mitigation effort by enhancing the secondary aerosol formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
