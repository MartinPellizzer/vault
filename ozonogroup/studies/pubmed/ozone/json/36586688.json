In this study, we took a large integrated industrial park in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River as an example, conducted a 1-year monitoring campaign of ambient air VOCs, and established a speciated VOC emission inventory based on the measured chemical profiles of the key industries. The comprehensive control index (CCI) of 125 VOCs was evaluated using the entropy weighting method based on comprehensive consideration of three aspects, namely, emission behavior, environmental effects, and health risks of VOCs, to identify priority VOC species and their key sources for VOC control in industrial parks. The total estimated VOC emissions in the industrial park in 2019 were 6446.96 t. Steel production, sewage treatment, natural gas chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, and industrial boilers were the main sources of VOC emissions. In terms of VOC components, halocarbons, aromatics, and OVOCs were the largest groups of VOCs emitted from the industrial park, accounting for 73.75 % of the total VOC emissions. Using the entropy weighting method, we evaluated the index weights of five parameters: emissions, ozone formation potential, secondary organic aerosol formation potential, hazard quotient, and lifetime cancer risk. Based on the CCI, five control levels for VOC species were further established. The VOC species in Level I and Level II, which contain species such as naphthalene, 2-chlorotoluene, benzene, acrolein, and chloroform, should be considered as extremely important priority control species. These results serve as a reference for the development of precise control strategies for VOCs in industrial parks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
