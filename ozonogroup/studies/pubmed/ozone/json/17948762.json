HPLC was used to analyze the Ace concentration. Total organic carbon (TOC) was used to measure the amount of water soluble organic compounds. GC-MS was used to identify the ozonized products. Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of activated sludge was used to characterize the biodegradability of ozonized products.", "During the ozonation process, Ace was degraded, new organic compounds were produced and these intermediate products were difficult mineralize by ozone, with increasing TOC of soluble organics. The ozonized products were degraded by activated sludge more easily than Ace.", "Ozonation decomposes the Ace and improves its biodegradability. The ozonation combined with biological treatment is probably an efficient and economical way to mineralize acenaphthene in wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jian-Long", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Environ Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8909524", "ISSNLinking": "0895-3988"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acenaphthenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V8UT1GAC5Y", "NameOfSubstance": "acenaphthene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acenaphthenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17948762"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
