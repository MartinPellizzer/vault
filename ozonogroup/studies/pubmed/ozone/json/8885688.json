The decomposition of DBS in aqueous solution resulted in the formation of the mutagens formaldehyde and glyoxal as intermediate products after the simultaneous treatment for 4 hr. Therefore, the aqueous solution containing decomposed DBS after the treatment for 4 hr was mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA104 in the presence and absence of S9 mix. However, the mutagenic activity was greater than the sum of the mutagenic activity of formaldehyde and glyoxal formed from DBS. The aqueous solution mixed with formaldehyde and glyoxal did not increase the mutagenicity above the sum of the mutagenic activity in the presence or absence of DBS. Furthermore, DBS at concentrations of 2.0 micrograms/plate or less did not affect the mutagenicity of the mixtures containing formaldehyde and glyoxal. In addition, there was little bacteriocidal effect of the mixed solution on the mutagenicity test strains. These results suggest that unidentified mutagenic intermediate products were produced from DBS after simultaneous treatment with ozone and UV irradiation for 4 hr."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bacteriology, School of Medicine, University of Tokushima, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murakami", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinouchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Tokushima J Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0417356", "ISSNLinking": "0040-8875"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50NP6JJ975", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyoxal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60NSK897G9", "NameOfSubstance": "dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glyoxal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8885688"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
