Significantly lower microbial counts of over 2.5 log10 (P less than .05) were observed for water-misted and ozonated (2.83% by weight) eggs or formaldehyde-fumigated (triple strength) eggs than for control and water-misted eggs. Eggshell conductance studies as measured by egg moisture losses in a desiccator showed no significant differences (P greater than .05) among untreated, water misted, ozonated (3.06% by weight) with water mist, or formaldehyde (triple strength)-fumigated eggs. Hatchability was significantly reduced (26.5 to 37.5%) following ozonation (3.03% ozone by weight, 2 h) in comparison with effects of no treatment or water misting. Misting with ozonation was equally as effective as formaldehyde fumigation in reducing microbial counts. However, ozone treatment at the concentrations tested significantly reduced hatchability when compared with results of either no treatment, water misting, or an average hatchability figure for formaldehyde fumigation. These findings indicate that ozone is a good disinfectant yet may adversely affect embryo development when given in the gaseous form."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27695-7624."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whistler", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheldon", "ForeName": "B W", "Initials": "BW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chick Embryo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egg Shell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eggs"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2780484", "10.3382/ps.0681074", "S0032-5791(19)57285-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
