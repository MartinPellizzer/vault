The impact of two disinfection regimens with ozone as a function of time, the heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), and the concentration of total organic compounds (TOC) in purified water were investigated over a period of 4 years. We have established that concentrations of ozone of 70 +/- 20 ppb in the production regimen and 250 +/- 50 ppb in the disinfection regimen are sufficient to maintain a low bioburden and low TOC in a recirculating distribution system. The purified water that entered into the distribution system has low HPC (0.01 CFU/mL), indicating a reduction by ozone in the storage tank by up to approximately 120-fold. Over 4 years, 94-98% of the microbial counts were in the category 0-5 CFU/mL, and none in category > or =50 CFU/mL. In spite of increased TOC in the inlet water, up to 40 ppb, the microbial counts in purified water in the distribution loop were unaffected. The study emphasizes that the critical points regarding microbial contamination of the purified water system are user point valves and the tubes used for transferring water to equipment. The specified ozone level prevents microbial growth and formation of biofilm in the distribution system that might otherwise endanger the water quality by sporadic release of microbes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krka d.d., Smihelska cesta 6, Novo mesto, Slovenia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Florjanic", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kristl", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7802620", "ISSNLinking": "0363-9045"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17090433", "10.1080/03639040600920614", "Q12893V76LWK5029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
