Strong correlations among numerous ambient pollutant concentrations, however, have made it difficult to determine the relative contribution of each pollutant to a given health outcome and have led to criticism that health effect estimates for particulate matter may be biased due to confounding. In the current study we used data collected from a multipollutant exposure study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, during both the summer and winter to address the potential for confounding further. Twenty-four-hour personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations to fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were measured for 56 subjects. Results from correlation and regression analyses showed that personal PM(2.5) and gaseous air pollutant exposures were generally not correlated, as only 9 of the 178 individual-specific pairwise correlations were significant. Similarly, ambient concentrations were not associated with their corresponding personal exposures for any of the pollutants, except for PM(2.5), which had significant associations during both seasons (p < 0.0001). Ambient gaseous concentrations were, however, strongly associated with personal PM(2.5) exposures. The strongest associations were shown between ambient O(3) and personal PM(2.5) (p < 0.0001 during both seasons). These results indicate that ambient PM(2.5) concentrations are suitable surrogates for personal PM(2.5) exposures and that ambient gaseous concentrations are surrogates, as opposed to confounders, of PM(2.5). These findings suggest that the use of multiple pollutant models in epidemiologic studies of PM(2.5) may not be suitable and that health effects attributed to the ambient gases may actually be a result of exposures to PM(2.5)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA. jsarnat@hsph.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarnat", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Catalano", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiologic Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2000 Jun;108(6):563-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10856032"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1999 Aug;107(8):637-41", "ArticleIdList": ["10417361"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2000 Jul;50(7):1223-35", "ArticleIdList": ["10939215"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2000 Jul;50(7):1236-50", "ArticleIdList": ["10939216"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1999 Sep;49(9 Spec No):182-91", "ArticleIdList": ["11002835"]}, {"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 2000 Dec 14;343(24):1742-9", "ArticleIdList": ["11114312"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2000 Dec;108(12):1179-87", "ArticleIdList": ["11133399"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1997 Jan;72(1):24-31", "ArticleIdList": ["9012369"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Jan;105(1):58-65", "ArticleIdList": ["9074882"]}, {"Citation": "J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol. 1998 Jan-Mar;8(1):79-100", "ArticleIdList": ["9470107"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Epidemiol. 1998 Mar 15;147(6):537-47", "ArticleIdList": ["9521180"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 1998 Jun;48(6):553-60", "ArticleIdList": ["9949739"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1999 Mar;107(3):217-22", "ArticleIdList": ["10064552"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1999 May;107(5):339-42", "ArticleIdList": ["10210688"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2000 Jul;50(7):1184-98", "ArticleIdList": ["10939211"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11675271", "PMC1242083", "10.1289/ehp.011091053", "sc271_5_1835"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
