Results from this study suggest that, although removal of a VOC generally increases with a decrease in its Henry's constant, an optimal Henry's constant range for biofiltration may exist. For the treatment of VOCs with high Henry's constant values, such as hexane and toluene, the transfer of VOCs between the vapor and liquid phases or between the vapor phase and the biofilm is a rate-determining step. However, oxygen (O2) transfer may become a rate-limiting step in treating VOCs with low Henry's constants, such as butanol, especially at high organic loadings. The results demonstrated that in a gas-phase aerobic biofilter, nitrate can serve both as a growth-controlling nutrient and as an electron acceptor in a biofilm for the respiration of VOCs with low Henry's constants. Microbial communities within the biofilters were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to provide a more complete picture of the effect of O2 limitation and denitrification on biofilter performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45221, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xueqing", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suidan", "ForeName": "Makram T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pruden", "ForeName": "Amy", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chunping", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alonso", "ForeName": "Cristina", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Byung J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Byung R", "Initials": "BR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15115369", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470918"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
