Hospital admissions for IS and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period from 2006-2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased admissions for IS were significantly associated with higher levels of PM2.5 on both warm days (>23\u00b0C) and cool days (<23\u00b0C), with an interquartile range rise associated with a 11% (95% CI = 8-14%) and 4% (95% CI = 2-7%) elevation in admissions for IS, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 remained significantly increased after inclusion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) or ozone (O3) on both warm and cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM2.5 enhance the risk of hospital admissions for IS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine , Kaohsiung Medical University , Kaohsiung , Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Hui-Fen", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24283370", "10.1080/15287394.2013.842463"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
