In this study, we examined the combined effects of O<sub>3</sub>, elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and soil nitrogen supply on Siebold's beech seedlings. Seedlings were grown under combinations of two levels of O<sub>3</sub> (low and two times ambient O<sub>3</sub> concentration), two levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (ambient and 700\u00a0ppm), and three levels of soil nitrogen supply (0, 50, and 100\u00a0kg\u00a0N ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) during two growing seasons (2019 and 2020), with leaf photosynthetic traits being determined during the second season. We found that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> ameliorated O<sub>3</sub>-induced reductions in photosynthetic activity, whereas the negative effects of O<sub>3</sub> on photosynthetic traits were enhanced by soil nitrogen supply. We observed three-factor interactions in photosynthetic traits, with the ameliorative effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on O<sub>3</sub>-induced reductions in the maximum rate of carboxylation being more pronounced under high than under low soil nitrogen conditions in July. In contrast, elevated CO<sub>2</sub>-induced amelioration of the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on stomatal function-related traits was more pronounced under low soil nitrogen conditions. Although we observed several two- or three-factor interactions of gas and soil treatments with respect to leaf photosynthetic traits, the shoot to root dry mass (S/R) ratio was the only parameter for which a significant interaction was detected among seedling growth parameters. O<sub>3</sub> caused a significant increase in S/R under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, whereas no similar effects were observed under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Collectively, our findings reveal the complex interactive effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and soil nitrogen supply on the detrimental effects of O<sub>3</sub> on leaf photosynthetic traits, and highlight the importance of taking into consideration differences between the responses of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and growth to these three environmental factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
