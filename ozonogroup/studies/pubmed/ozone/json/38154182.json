As a kind of typical organochlorine pesticide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) cannot be efficiently removed by CC. To enhance the 2,4-D removal, ozonation was applied with coagulation. The hybrid ozonation-coagulation (HOC) achieved 60.61% DOC removal efficiency, which was obviously higher than pre-ozonation coagulation (POC) (45.83%). Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy revealed stronger complexation between modified 2,4-D and coagulants during the HOC than that in subsequent coagulation of the POC process. During the HOC process, ozone promoted the formation of polymeric Al species, such as Al<sub>b</sub>. To investigate the 2,4-D removal mechanism, \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> process with the same oxidation ability as the HOC was established. 2,4-D was oxidized step-by-step to 2,4-dichlorophenol, 4,6-dichlororesorcin, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 2-chlorohydroquinone, 4-chlorocatechol, 1,2,4,5-tetrahydroxybenzene, pentahydroxybenzene and oxalic acid in \u03b3-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> process. However, during the HOC process, these oxidized intermediates were readily complexed by coagulants and accumulated in flocs. Especially 1,2,4,5-tetrahydroxybenzene and pentahydroxybenzene, completely complexed by AlCl<sub>3</sub>\u20226H<sub>2</sub>O hydrolysates as soon as being formed. Immediate entrapment and complexation between coagulant hydrolysates and 2,4-D oxidized intermediates inhibited the generation of small-molecular-weight organics such as oxalic acid, which enhanced the removal of organics with low coagulability."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
