N<sub>2</sub>O can be produced via multiple processes, and reduced, with the involvement of more diverse microbes with different physiological constraints than previously thought; therefore, there is a lack of consensus on the production processes and microbes involved under different agricultural practices. In this study, multiple approaches were applied, including N<sub>2</sub>O isotopocule analyses, microbial gene transcript measurements, and selective inhibition assays, to revisit the involvement of NH<sub>3</sub> oxidizers and denitrifiers, including the previously-overlooked taxa, in N<sub>2</sub>O emission from a cropland, and address the biological and environmental factors controlling the N<sub>2</sub>O production processes. Then, we synthesized the results from those approaches and revealed that the overlooked denitrifying bacteria and fungi were more involved in N<sub>2</sub>O production than the long-studied ones. We also demonstrated that the N<sub>2</sub>O production processes and soil microbes involved were different based on fertilization practices (plowing or surface application) and fertilization types (manure or urea). In particular, we identified the following intensified activities: (1) N<sub>2</sub>O production by overlooked denitrifying fungi after manure fertilization onto soil surface; (2) N<sub>2</sub>O production by overlooked denitrifying bacteria and N<sub>2</sub>O reduction by long-studied N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacteria after manure fertilization into the plowed layer; and (3) N<sub>2</sub>O production by NH<sub>3</sub>-oxidizing bacteria and overlooked denitrifying bacteria and fungi when urea fertilization was applied into the plowed layer. We finally propose the conceptual scheme of N flow after fertilization based on distinct physiological constraints among the diverse NH<sub>3</sub> oxidizers and denitrifiers, which will help us understand the environmental context-dependent N<sub>2</sub>O emission processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
