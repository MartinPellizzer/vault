Therefore, some methods dedicated to the detection and structural characterization of such by-products have emerged. However, most of these studies are usually carried out under simplified conditions (e.g. high concentration levels of micropollutants, drastic treatment conditions, use of deionized or ultrapure water) and somewhat unrealistic conditions compared to that implemented in water treatment plants. In the present study, a real field water sample was fortified at the part-per-billion level (50 \u03bcg L(-1)) with estrone-3-sulfate (E1-3S) before being ozonated (at 1 mg L(-1)) for 10 min. In a first step, targeted measurements evidenced a degradation of the parent compound (>80%) in 10 min. Secondly, a non-targeted chemical profiling approach derived from metabolomic profiling studies allowed to reveal 11 ozonation by-products, among which 4 were found predominant. The estrogenic activity of these water samples spiked with E1-3S before and after treatment was assessed by the ER-CALUX assay and was found to decrease significantly after 10 min of ozonation. Therefore, this innovative methodological strategy demonstrated its suitability and relevancy for revealing unknown compounds generated from water treatment, and permitted to generate new results regarding specifically the impact of ozonation on estrone-3-sulfate. These results confirm that ozonation is effective at removing E1-3S in drinking water and indicate that the by-products generated have significantly lower estrogenic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
