Recently, Dawes and co-workers [Dawes, Lolur, Li, Jiang, and Guo (DLLJG) J. Chem. Phys. 139, 201103 (2013)] created a highly accurate global PES, for which the reef is found to be replaced with a (monotonic) \"plateau.\" Subsequent dynamical calculations on this \"DLLJG\" PES have shown improved agreement with experiment, particularly the vibrational spectrum. However, it is well known that reaction dynamics is also highly influenced by the rovibrational states, especially in cases like ozone that assume a Lindemann-type mechanism. Accordingly, we present the first significant step toward a complete characterization of the rovibrational spectrum for various isotopologues of ozone, computed using the DLLJG PES together with the ScalIT suite of parallel codes. Additionally, artificial neural networks are used in an innovative fashion-not to construct the PES function per se but rather to greatly speed up its evaluation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, 12.228-900, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petty", "ForeName": "Corey", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, 12.228-900, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000000225777831"], "LastName": "Spada", "ForeName": "Rene F K", "Initials": "RFK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Aeron\u00e1utica, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, 12.228-900, SP, Brazil."}], "Identifier": ["0000000220643463"], "LastName": "Machado", "ForeName": "Francisco B C", "Initials": "FBC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Poirier", "ForeName": "Bill", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30007387", "10.1063/1.5036602"]}}]}
