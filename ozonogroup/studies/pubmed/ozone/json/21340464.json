In this work, we analyzed annual fluctuations in the content of phenol, guaiacol, chlorophenols, chlorocatechols, and chlorinated methoxyphenols in drinking water collected in Warsaw and Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki (Poland). Moreover, the effect of dissolved organic matter content on the occurrence of phenolic compounds in drinking water was studied.", "The compounds were adsorbed on octadecyl C18 solid-phase discs, separated by the use of gas chromatography, and analyzed using mass spectrometry. The content of organic matter was evaluated by the analysis of UV absorption at 254\u00a0nm by water samples. In Warsaw, raw water (derived from infiltration intakes situated in the Vistula River) and treated water (subjected to coagulation, filtration, and disinfection with chlorine dioxide) were collected in order to analyze phenols. In Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki, raw water (taken directly form the river) and treated water (subjected to coagulation, sand filtration, ozonation, and disinfection with gaseous chlorine) were taken to determine phenolic substances.", "The obtained results showed the occurrence of phenol, guaiacol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), tetrachlorophenol (TeCP), and pentachlorophenol in drinking water of both cities. Occasionally, in the waters studied, the appearance of chloroguaiacols, 3-chlorosyringol, and some chlorocatechols were noted. It was also observed that the content of dissolved organic matter in river waters may have contributed to the formation of some phenols, e.g., phenol, guaiacol, 2,4,6-TCP, and TeCP in drinking water. Finally, it was found that there were no annual (seasonal) fluctuations in phenolic compounds contents in drinking waters examined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Pollution Biophysics, University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Banacha 12/16 Street, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. michalow@biol.uni.lodz.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Micha\u0142owicz", "ForeName": "Jaromir", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stufka-Olczyk", "ForeName": "Jadwiga", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milczarek", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michniewicz", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Pollut Res Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9441769", "ISSNLinking": "0944-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6JKA7MAH9C", "NameOfSubstance": "Guaiacol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Guaiacol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Water Res. 2010 May;44(10):3147-65", "ArticleIdList": ["20409572"]}, {"Citation": "Biodegradation. 2008 Jul;19(4):507-18", "ArticleIdList": ["17934786"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2003 Apr;37(7):1443-67", "ArticleIdList": ["12600374"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2009 May;43(8):2057-92", "ArticleIdList": ["19304309"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2007 Jan;66(4):657-63", "ArticleIdList": ["16963105"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 1989 Jul 1;83(1-2):161-72", "ArticleIdList": ["2781264"]}, {"Citation": "Mutat Res. 1981 May;89(1):45-55", "ArticleIdList": ["7017390"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2003 Aug;52(6):967-73", "ArticleIdList": ["12781230"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2004 May;54(Pt 3):851-855", "ArticleIdList": ["15143035"]}, {"Citation": "Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser. 1989 Mar;349:1-265", "ArticleIdList": ["12704435"]}, {"Citation": "Bioresour Technol. 2009 Feb;100(4):1622-7", "ArticleIdList": ["18977138"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicol Ind Health. 1987 Dec;3(4):535-68", "ArticleIdList": ["3324392"]}, {"Citation": "Life Sci. 2004 May 7;74(25):3065-74", "ArticleIdList": ["15081572"]}, {"Citation": "Water Res. 2001 Mar;35(4):985-96", "ArticleIdList": ["11235894"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2008 Apr;71(6):1181-7", "ArticleIdList": ["18037470"]}, {"Citation": "IARC Monogr Eval Carcinog Risks Hum. 1995;63:33-477", "ArticleIdList": ["9139128"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol. 1991 Nov;21(4):596-606", "ArticleIdList": ["1759853"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2008 Mar;71(4):735-41", "ArticleIdList": ["18048080"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Epidemiol. 2000 Mar;16(3):245-51", "ArticleIdList": ["10870939"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21340464", "10.1007/s11356-011-0469-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
