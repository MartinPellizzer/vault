A study of latex condom deterioration was conducted with commercial non-lubricated condoms exposed to ozone levels commonly present in urban smog conditions. Environmental conditions during transport and storage may weaken the latex and contribute to its corrosive effects. In this study, commercial non-lubricated latex condoms were exposed to ozone in an environmental chamber. Deterioration was assessed by scanning electron microscopy after 18 hours of exposure. Condom air burst test protocols from the International Organization for Standardization were used to assess mechanical strength. Results revealed that there was marked deterioration of the condom wall after exposure to ozone after 6-48 hours. Mechanical strength was also decreased after 24 hours' exposure according to air burst test criteria. 3 different brands were tested to ensure that the effects were not limited to 1 brand. The condoms were non-lubricated and unpackaged when exposed, which is important in the interpretation of these results because most condoms marketed in the U.S. are pre-lubricated. Packaging may also provide additional protection. But the study did reveal a fundamental ozone-latex reaction. Anti-ozonant treatments, used in tires and other rubber products, could be an option for the prevention of deterioration in latex condoms. Careful transport and storage of condoms is important to protect them from environmentally accelerated deterioration."]}], "OtherID": ["054478", "00181168"], "PMID": "2714087", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "06", "Day": "16"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "24"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "39", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "Latex condom deterioration accelerated by environmental factors: I.

Loss of mechanical strength was quantitated by measurement of the air pressures necessary to burst the condom and volumes at burst. After 24 hours exposure to ozone the latex surface was covered with craters and after 48 hours the pressure required to burst the condom was 44% that of control samples.
