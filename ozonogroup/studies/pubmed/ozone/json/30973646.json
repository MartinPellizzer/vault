In the current work, disinfestation of stored wheat grain infested with a common insect, Rhyzopertha dominica, was attempted through ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) treatment as an alternative to chemical fumigants.", "The optimized treatment conditions for ozone fumigation of stored wheat grain were 12% (w/w) grain moisture, 2.5\u2009g m<sup>-3</sup> ozone concentration and 8\u00a0h of treatment. The mortality of R. dominica adults, pupae, larvae and eggs was 97, 100, 99 and 100%, respectively. Moisture and protein content of the ozone-treated wheat was found to be lower as compared to infested wheat. Microstructural changes in the treated samples were clearly visible on scanning electron microscopy images, whereas minimal changes at the molecular level and of rheological parameters were evident based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy peak and rheometry data.", "Ozone was found to be an effective reagent for disinfestation, aimed at all life stages of R. dominica in stored wheat grain, that leaves no residue behind. Rotational strategies can be applied to obtain increased mortality while maintaining the usability of the grain for different purposes. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-8941-5445"], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Gayatri", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rural Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palle", "ForeName": "Aphiya Amulya", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4808-7865"], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Shubhangi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Hari N", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Storage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pupa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30973646", "10.1002/jsfa.9742"]}}]}
