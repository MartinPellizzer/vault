All additives, except thiourea, significantly increased the TNT removal efficiency by gamma irradiation. The overall results of the additive experiments implied that the TNT decomposition would be initiated by *OH, e(aq)(-), and HO(2*)/O(2*)(-), and also implied that *H did not have any direct effect on the TNT decomposition. Additions of methanol and nitrous oxide were more effective in TNT removal than the other additives, achieving complete removal of TNT at doses below 20 kGy. Total organic carbon (TOC) of the irradiated solution was analyzed to evaluate the degree of TNT mineralization under the additive conditions. TOC under the nitrous oxide addition was removed rapidly, and complete TNT mineralization was thus achieved at 50 kGy. Methanol addition was very effective in the TNT removal, but it was not effective in reduction in TOC. Trinitrobenzene (TNB), oxalic acid and glyoxalic acid were detected as radiolytic organic by-products, while ammonia and nitrate were detected as radiolytic inorganic by-products. The most efficient TNT removal and its mineralization by gamma irradiation would be achieved by supersaturating the solution with nitrous oxide before irradiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Kunsan National University, Kunsan, South Korea. bjlee70@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Byungjin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Seung-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hazardous Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "118-96-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Trinitrotoluene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hazardous Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trinitrotoluene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19036516", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.10.017", "S0304-3894(08)01491-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
