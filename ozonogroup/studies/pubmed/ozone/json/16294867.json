These new contaminants are important because many of them are not degraded under the typical biological treatments applied in the wastewater treatment plants and represent a continuous input into the environment. Thus, compounds such as diclofenac are present in surface waters in all Europe and a crucial need for more enhanced technologies that can reduce its presence in the environment has become evident. In this sense, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) represent a good choice for the treatment of hazardous nonbiodegradable pollutants. This work deals with the solar photodegradation of diclofenac, an antiinflammatory drug, in aqueous solutions by photo-Fenton reaction. A pilot-scale facility using a compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactor was used for this study. Results obtained show rapid and complete oxidation of diclofenac after 60 min, and total mineralization (disappearance of dissolved organic carbon, DOC) after 100 min of exposure to sunlight. Although diclofenac precipitates during the process at low pH, its degradation takes place in the homogeneous phase governed by a precipitation-redissolution-degradation process. Establishment of the reaction pathway was made possible by a thorough analysis of the reaction mixture identifying the main intermediate products generated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/ MS) and liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) were used to identify 18 intermediates, in two tentative degradation routes. The main one was based on the initial hydroxylation of the phenylacetic acid moiety in the C-4 position and subsequent formation of a quinone imine derivative that was the starting point for further multistep degradation involving hydroxylation, decarboxylation, and oxidation reactions. An alternative route was based on the transient preservation of the biphenyl amino moiety that underwent a similar oxidative process of C-N bond cleavage. The proposed degradation route differs from those previously reported involving alternative degradation processes (ozonization, UV/H2O2, or photolysis), indicating that diclofenac degradation follows different pathways, depending on the treatment applied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plataforma Solar de Almer\u00eda, CIEMAT, Carretera Sen\u00e9s Km. 4, 04200 Tabernas, Espa\u00f1a."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "P\u00e9rez-Estrada", "ForeName": "Le\u00f3nidas A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Malato", "ForeName": "Sixto", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gernjak", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ag\u00fcera", "ForeName": "Ana", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thurman", "ForeName": "E Michael", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferrer", "ForeName": "Imma", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Alba", "ForeName": "Amadeo R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "144O8QL0L1", "NameOfSubstance": "Diclofenac"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diclofenac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16294867", "10.1021/es050794n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
