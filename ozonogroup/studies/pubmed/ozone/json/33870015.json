Using spatiotemporal models and participant home address, we assigned 1-year (2008) and 5-year (2004-2008) average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), elemental carbon (EC), and ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and distance to major roadway. We examined associations of 1- and 5-year exposures, and distance to road, with CT vascular volumes using multivariable linear regression models.", "There was a consistent negative association of higher O<sub>3</sub> with lower small vessel volumes, which persisted after adjustment for distance to road. Per interquartile range (IQR) of 2008 O<sub>3</sub>, BV5 was 0.34 mL lower (95% confidence intervals [CI], -0.61 to -0.06; <i>P</i> = 0.02), with similar results for 5-year exposure. One-year EC exposure and closer proximity to road were weakly associated with small vessel volumes; BV5 was 0.18 mL higher per IQR of 2008 EC (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.42; <i>P</i> = 0.13) and 0.40 mL higher per IQR closer proximity to road (95% CI: -0.10 to 0.89; <i>P</i> = 0.12).
