Most of the evidence for immunotoxicity of such contaminants has been obtained from laboratory animal studies and risk assessors must make decisions about risk to the human population based on these studies. Uncertainties associated with this process include determining what level of immune suppression is adverse, extrapolating across species from rodent to human, and across levels of biologic organization from effects on immune function at the cellular level to effects on incidence of disease at the population level, accounting for intra-species variability, and assessing the relationship between effects following acute, subchronic, and chronic exposure. This paper reviews immunotoxicity data that may be applied to the development of risk assessment methods and models designed to reduce some of these uncertainties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selgrade", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immune System"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10413194", "10.1016/s0300-483x(99)00006-2", "S0300-483X(99)00006-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
