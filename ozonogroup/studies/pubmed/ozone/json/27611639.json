This study investigated the reaction kinetics and mechanisms of NDMA formation during ozonation of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and daminozide (DMZ) as structural model N,N-dimethylhydrazine compounds. The reaction of ozone with these NDMA precursor compounds was fast, and k<sub>O3</sub> at pH 7 was 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> for UDMH and 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> for DMZ. Molar NDMA yields (i.e., \u0394[NDMA]/\u0394[precursor]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100) were 84% and 100% for UDMH and DMZ, respectively, determined at molar ozone dose ratio ([O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>0</sub>/[precursor]<sub>0</sub>) of \u22654 in the presence of tert-butanol as hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenger. The molar NDMA yields decreased significantly in the absence of tert-butanol, indicating OH formation and its subsequent reaction with the parent precursors forming negligible NDMA. The k<sub>OH</sub> at pH 7 was 4.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup>\u00a0M<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> for UDMH and DMZ, respectively. Reaction mechanisms are proposed in which an ozone adduct is formed at the nitrogen next to N,N-dimethylamine which decomposes via homolytic and heterolytic cleavages of the -N<sup>+</sup>-O-O-O<sup>-</sup> bond, forming NDMA as a final product. The heterolytic cleavage pathway explains the significant OH formation via radical intermediates. Overall, significant NDMA formation was found to be unavoidable during ozonation or even O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of waters containing N,N-dimethylhydrazine compounds due to their rapid reaction with ozone forming NDMA with high yield. Thus, source control or pre-treatment of N,N-dimethylhydrazine precursors and post-treatment of NDMA are proposed as the mitigation options."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
