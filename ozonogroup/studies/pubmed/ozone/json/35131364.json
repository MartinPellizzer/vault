The efficacy of ozone's oxidative potential on common microorganisms has been extensively studied, particularly in the food and water treatment industries. However, little is still understood regarding its antimicrobial capabilities for the treatment of textile substrates in air. In this study, fabric swatches inoculated with bacterial and fungal suspensions are exposed to ozone for different durations and at different ozone concentrations. Pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus), and fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans), are the microbes utilised in this study. The efficacy of ozone is demonstrated by the complete removal of microbiota on the tested swatches when a concentration and exposure duration of 20\u00a0ppm and 4 mins are respectively maintained in a test ozone chamber. We expect the insights from this work to guide the development of new ozonation techniques capable of rapid sterilisation in industrial & public settings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
