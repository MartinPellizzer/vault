The surface chemistry of UVO-PS has been extensively characterized. Although cells attached rapidly to the oxidized dishes with serum present it was found that serum actually inhibits the rate of attachment. Spreading of attached cells was favored by the presence of serum. It is suggested that the increased quantity of hydrophilic carboxyl groups on longer exposed UVO-PS leads to a change in the protein layer adsorbed from serum and also a higher affinity of the surface for extracellular proteins secreted by the attached cells. The UVO-PS surfaces present a new way of producing tissue culture grade polystyrene (TCPS) in a highly controllable method, which would ensure greater consistency in TCPS surfaces.
