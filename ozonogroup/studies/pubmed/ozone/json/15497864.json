With the combination of chromosomal aberration test and a new analytical technique to differentiate total organic chlorine (TOCl) and total organic bromine (TOBr), it was found that TOBr was correlated to the mutagenicity of chlorinated waters. It was also implied that for a bromide-to-TOC ratio of 0.1 (mg/mg C), brominated DBPs could account for at least 29% of the total toxicity of DBPs formed during chlorination. On the other hand, bromate ion, a major ozonation DBP, was not a major contributor to the activity inducing chromosomal aberrations of the water treated with an ozone/chlorine sequential process. Therefore, ozonation is one possible option to reduce the health risk caused by DBPs even in the presence of bromide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban Management, Kyoto University, Yoshidahonmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. echigo@urban.env.kyoto-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Echigo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Natsui", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Araki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ando", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Humic Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "712K4CDC10", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypochlorous Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Humic Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hypochlorous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15497864"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
