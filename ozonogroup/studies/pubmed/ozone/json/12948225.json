We calculated the ORAQI with the data obtained at four air-pollution monitoring stations located in the city of Salamanca over the period between 1993 and 2001. For the calculations, SO2, PM10, NO2, CO and O3 were used as the most significant pollutants for the surroundings of the monitoring stations. The evolution of this index over 9 years is reported, and the repercussion of the most characteristic pollutants of each season of the year on the ORAQI along the whole period analysed is studied. The importance of the summer pollution in the characterisation of the least polluted surroundings was observed. At the most polluted sites, a decrease in the values corresponding to winter occurs, leading the ORAQI to take similar values along the whole year. In general, taking into account the surroundings of all the monitoring stations, the quality of the air to which the inhabitants of the city of Salamanca are exposed to can be said to be good."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dpto. de Qu\u00edmica Anal\u00edtica, Nutrici\u00f3n y Bromatologia, Universidad de Salamanca, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez Cabrera", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fidalgo Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00edn Mateos", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12948225", "10.1039/b302664g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
