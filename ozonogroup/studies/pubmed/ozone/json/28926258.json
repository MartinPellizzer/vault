Infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations were employed to identify and characterize the products formed in each case. Together, these deposition techniques provide information over the essentially full course of the gas-phase reaction. At short times with twin jet deposition, the primary product is the O atom insertion product (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>AlOCH<sub>3</sub>. With merged jet deposition and longer gas-phase mixing times, the methyl peroxy radical H<sub>3</sub>COO\u00b7 was seen in good yield along with final stable products H<sub>2</sub>CO, H<sub>3</sub>COH, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. Production of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and its deposition onto the walls of the reaction tube as a powdery film was noted as well. All of these outcomes were combined to propose a reaction mechanism for this system. Of particular note, the observation of H<sub>3</sub>COO\u00b7 provides clear evidence for a free radical component to the overall mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati , P.O.
