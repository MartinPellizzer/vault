The main sources of OH radicals are the photolysis of ozone and the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO). Due to the attenuation of solar radiation in the indoor environment, the possibility of OH formation through photolytic pathways indoors has been ignored up to now. In the indoor air, the ozonolysis of alkenes has been suggested as an alternative route of OH formation. Models and indirect measurements performed up to now according to this hypothesis suggest concentrations of OH radicals on the order of 10(4)-10(5) molecules per cubic centimeter. Here, we present direct measurements of significant amounts of OH radicals of up to 1.8\u22c510(6) molecules per cubic centimeter during an experimental campaign carried out in a school classroom in Marseille. This concentration is on the same order of magnitude of outdoor OH levels in the urban scenario. We also show that photolysis of HONO is an important source of OH radicals indoors under certain conditions (i.e., direct solar irradiation inside the room). Additionally, the OH concentrations were found to follow a linear dependence with the product J(HONO)\u22c5[HONO]. This was also supported by using a simple quasiphotostationary state model on the OH radical budget. These findings force a change in our understanding of indoor air quality because the reactivity linked to OH would involve formation of secondary species through chemical reactions that are potentially more hazardous than the primary pollutants in the indoor air."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aix Marseille University, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Formation de Recherche en Evolution 3416, 13331 Marseille, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez Alvarez", "ForeName": "Elena", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amedro", "ForeName": "Damien", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Afif", "ForeName": "Charbel", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gligorovski", "ForeName": "Sasho", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schoemaecker", "ForeName": "Coralie", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fittschen", "ForeName": "Christa", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doussin", "ForeName": "Jean-Francois", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wortham", "ForeName": "Henri", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NlmUniqueID": "7505876", "ISSNLinking": "0027-8424"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T2I5UM75DN", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrous Acid"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Sep 24;110(39):15848", "Note": "Schoemacker, Coralie [corrected to Schoemaecker, Coralie]"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrous Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schools"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Finlayson-Pitts BJ, Pitts JN., Jr Tropospheric air pollution: Ozone, airborne toxics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particles.
