The aim of this experiment was to determine the effect of 1-bromopropane on female reproductive function in rats. Forty female Wistar rats were divided into four equal groups. Each group was exposed daily to 0, 200, 400, or 800 ppm of 1-bromopropane for eight h a day. After exposure for 7 weeks, all rats in the 800-ppm group became seriously ill and were sacrificed during the 8th week. The other dose groups were exposed for 12 weeks. In the 800-ppm group, but not in the other two exposed groups, body weight was significantly less than the control at each time point from 2 to 7 weeks after the beginning of exposure. Tests of vaginal smears showed a significant increase in the number of irregular estrous cycles with extended diestrus in the 400- and 800-ppm groups. Histopathological examination of the ovary showed a significant dose-dependent reduction of the number of normal antral follicles and a decrease in the number of normal growing follicles in the 400-ppm group. No significant change was found in plasma concentrations of LH or FSH in any group when compared with the control. Our results indicate that 1-bromopropane can induce a dose-dependent ovarian dysfunction in nonpregnant female rats associated with disruption in follicular growth process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan. tetsu@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Tetsuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ichihara", "ForeName": "Gaku", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hailan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xiaozhong", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "Kei-ichiro", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsukamura", "ForeName": "Hiroko", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamijima", "ForeName": "Michihiro", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakajima", "ForeName": "Tamie", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takeuchi", "ForeName": "Yasuhiro", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9805461", "ISSNLinking": "1096-0929"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y9746DNE68", "NameOfSubstance": "1-bromopropane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Estrous Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Follicle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vaginal Smears"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12520079", "10.1093/toxsci/71.1.96"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
