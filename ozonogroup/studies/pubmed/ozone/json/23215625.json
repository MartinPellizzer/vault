Mixed results are obtained from various therapies, usually drugs, but also oxygen inhalation, behavioral psychology, physical therapy, and peripheral or central neurostimulation. When refractory to treatment, it has severe impact on quality of life. OBJECTIVES/SUBJECTS: Five (5) patients are presented who had suffered from severe/persistent headache refractory to standard management (including 5-HT1 agonist triptan drugs) and were treated with ozone therapy.", "Ozone administration was by major autohemotherapy. The procedure involved venous blood drawn into a sterile single-use glass bottle containing anticoagulant, gently mixed with an equal volume of O3/O2 gas mixture (prefiltered through a sterile 0.20-\u03bcm filter) and slowly reinfused back into the donor patient via the antecubital vein.", "The analyzed parameters were analgesia requirements, days of sick leave due to headache, number of headache events, and pain intensity according to the visual analogue scale (VAS); these recorded at three time points: pre-ozone therapy, post-ozone therapy, and before the last follow-up (mean: 64.6\u00b136.8 months).", "The number of headache episodes pretreatment (n=80; range 5-200) was significantly decreased during the first 6 months post-treatment (n=0, range 0-1; p=0.042) and over the 6 months before the last follow-up visit (n=1, range 0-2; p=0.043). The corresponding VAS scores were 8.7\u00b10.8 pretreatment versus 1.1\u00b12.5 the 6 months post-treatment (p=0.003) and versus 3.1\u00b13.3 the 6 months before last follow-up visit (p=0.036).", "Ozone therapy decreased headache episodes and pain severity over a protracted period.
