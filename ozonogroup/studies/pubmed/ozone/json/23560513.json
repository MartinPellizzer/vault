In overdoses, it is associated with nephrotoxicity. We examined the potential protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and NAC + ozone therapy (OT) combination against APAP-induced nephrotoxicity.", "Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: sham, control (APAP), NAC, and NAC + OT. In the APAP, NAC, and NAC + OT groups, kidney injury was induced by oral administration of 1 g/kg APAP. The NAC group received NAC (100 mg/kg/day). NAC + OT group received NAC (100 mg/kg/day) and ozone/oxygen mixture (0.7 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 5 days immediately after APAP administration. All animals were killed at 5 days after APAP administration. Renal tissues and blood samples were obtained for biochemical and histopathological analyses. Neopterin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels were measured in sera. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were determined in renal homogenates.", "NAC and NAC + OT significantly decreased MDA and TNF-\u03b1 levels and increased IL-10 levels and GPx activities. Serum neopterin and IL-6 levels were not different among all groups. APAP administration caused tubular necrosis in the kidney. The degrees of renal necrosis of the APAP group were higher than the other groups. Renal injury in rats treated with combination of NAC and OT were found to be significantly less than the other groups.", "Our results showed that NAC and OT prevented renal injury in rats and reduced inflammation. These findings suggest that combination of NAC and OT might improve renal damages because of both oxidative stress and inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Diskapi, Ankara, Turkey. drfucar@gmail.com"}], "LastName": "Ucar", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taslipinar", "ForeName": "Mine Yavuz", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alp", "ForeName": "Bilal Firat", "Initials": "BF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aydin", "ForeName": "Ibrahim", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aydin", "ForeName": "Fevzi Nuri", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agilli", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Toygar", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ozkan", "ForeName": "Esin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Macit", "ForeName": "Enis", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oztosun", "ForeName": "Muzaffer", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cayci", "ForeName": "Tuncer", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ozcan", "ForeName": "Ayhan", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ren Fail", "NlmUniqueID": "8701128", "ISSNLinking": "0886-022X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Nephritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23560513", "10.3109/0886022X.2013.780530"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
