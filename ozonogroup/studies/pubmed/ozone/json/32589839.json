In this study, two types of soot obtained using different air/fuel ratios (A/F) were aged under visible light with or without ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at an atmospherically relevant level in an environmental chamber. Physicochemical characteristics and OP of aged soot were systematically measured using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay (OP<sup>DTT</sup>). Regardless of the presence of O<sub>3</sub>, visible light markedly promoted oxidation of soot, which led to consumption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, formation of oxygen-containing functional groups, and enhancement of OP<sup>DTT</sup> values. Compared to low-A/F soot, high-A/F soot contained more elemental carbon but less organic carbon and was more sensitive to visible light by exhibiting greater changes. It was proposed that elemental carbon in soot under visible-light irradiation initiated an inside-to-outside oxidation pathway, where reactive oxygen species played an important role. This study clarified the solar irradiation-triggered self-oxidation process in soot, which is important to its atmospheric and health effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jiali", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9335-139X"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yueyue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soot"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soot"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32589839", "10.1021/acs.est.0c01150"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
