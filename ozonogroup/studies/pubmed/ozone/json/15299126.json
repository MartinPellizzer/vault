In industrialized countries, [O(3)] has risen by 0.5% to 2.5% per year. Tropospheric [O(3)] is predicted to reach a global mean of >60 nL L(-1) by 2050 with greater averages locally. Previous studies in enclosures suggest that this level of [O(3)] will decrease leaf photosynthesis, thereby limiting growth and yield of Glycine max L. Merr. SoyFACE (Soybean Free Air gas Concentration Enrichment) is the first facility to elevate atmospheric [O(3)] (approximately 1.2x current) in replicated plots under completely open-air conditions within an agricultural field. Measurements of gas exchange (assimilation versus light and assimilation versus intercellular [CO(2)]) were made on excised leaves from control and treatment plots (n = 4). In contrast to expectations from previous chamber studies, elevated [O(3)] did not alter light-saturated photosynthesis (A(sat), P = 0.09), carboxylation capacity (V(c,max), P = 0.82), or maximum electron transport (J(max), P = 0.66) for the topmost most recently fully expanded leaf at any stage of crop development. Leaves formed during the vegetative growth stage did not show a significant ozone-induced loss of photosynthetic capacity as they aged. Leaves formed during flowering did show a more rapid loss of photosynthetic capacity as they aged in elevated [O(3)]. A(sat), V(c,max), and J(max) (P = 0.04, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively) were decreased 20% to 30% by treatment with ozone. This is noteworthy since these leaves provide photosynthate to the developing grain. In conclusion, a small (approximately 20%) increase in tropospheric [O(3)] did not significantly alter photosynthetic capacity of newly expanded leaves, but as these leaves aged, losses in photosynthetic carbon assimilation occurred."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Plant Biology and of Crop Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "Patrick B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernacchi", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ort", "ForeName": "Donald R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Stephen P", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Illinois"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ainsworth EA, Davey PA, Bernacchi CJ, Dermody OC, Heaton EA, Moore DJ, Morgan PB, Naidu SL, Ra HY, Zhu X, et al (2002) A meta-analysis of elevated [CO2] effects on soybean (Glycine max) physiology, growth and yield.
