Those in Group B took FGG. Those in Group C received ozone injection (10 -18 mL) from knee joint cavity at 25 mg/L, once weekly for 4 weeks in total. Those in Group D received injection from knee joint cavity and took FGG. The therapeutic course for all was one month. The efficacy was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Western Ontario MacMaster University Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC).", "The VAS score was obviously lower in Group D than in Group B and Group A at 24 h and 1 week (P <0. 05). After one month of treatment, the VAS score was obviously lower in Group D than in Group A, B, and C (P < 0.05). After treatment the total integral of WOMAC was 25.34 +/- 2.12 in Group D, obviously lower than that in Group A (44.72 +/- 6.57), Group B (40.58 +/- 5.98), and Group C (38.53 +/- 5. 13), showing statistical difference (P <0.05).
