Flares and compressor engines used in natural gas operations, for example, are large sources not only of NOx but also offormaldehyde, a hazardous air pollutant and powerful ozone precursor We used a neighborhood scale (200 m horizontal resolution) three-dimensional (3D) air dispersion model with an appropriate chemical mechanism to simulate ozone formation in the vicinity ofa hypothetical natural gas processing facility, based on accepted estimates of both regular and nonroutine emissions. The model predicts that, under average midday conditions in June, regular emissions mostly associated with compressor engines may increase ambient ozone in the Barnett Shale by more than 3 ppb beginning at about 2 km downwind of the facility, assuming there are no other major sources of ozone precursors. Flare volumes of 100,000 cubic meters per hour ofnatural gas over a period of 2 hr can also add over 3 ppb to peak 1-hr ozone somewhatfurther (>8 km) downwind, once dilution overcomes ozone titration and inhibition by large flare emissions of NOx. The additional peak ozone from the hypothetical flare can briefly exceed 10 ppb about 16 km downwind. The enhancements of ambient ozone predicted by the model are significant, given that ozone control strategy widths are of the order of a few parts per billion. Degrading the horizontal resolution of the model to 1 km spuriously enhances the simulated ozone increases by reducing the effectiveness of ozone inhibition and titration due to artificial plume dilution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Houston Advanced Research Center, 4800 Research Forest Dr, The Woodlands, TX 77381, USA. eolaguer@harc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olaguer", "ForeName": "Eduardo P", "Initials": "EP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Petroleum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2013 Feb;63(2):125-6. doi: 10.1080/10962247.2013.760323", "PMID": "23472294"}, {"RefSource": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2013 Feb;63(2):127-8. doi: 10.1080/10962247.2013.760325", "PMID": "23472295"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Extraction and Processing Industry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Petroleum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Texas"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22916444", "10.1080/10962247.2012.688923"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
