The objectives of this experimental study of sour cherry juice were fourfold: (1) to quantify the removal efficiency of new processing technologies (PEF, O, US), and their combinations, for the pesticides chlorpyrifos ethyl, \u03c4-fluvalinate, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin, and malathion; (2) to detect their impact on physical, bioactive, and sensory properties; (3) to determine their microbial inactivation levels for Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas syringae subs. Syringae, and Penicillum expansum; and (4) to jointly optimize multiple responses of physical, quality, and sensory properties, pesticides, and microbial inactivation.", "Except for all the O treatments, the physical, bioactive and sensory properties of sour cherry juice were not adversely affected by the treatments. The joint optimization suggested PEF1 (24.7\u00a0kV\u2009cm<sup>-1</sup> for 327\u2009\u03bcs), PEF2 (24.7\u00a0kV\u2009cm<sup>-1</sup> for 655\u2009\u03bcs), PEF2\u2009+\u2009O\u2009+\u2009US, US, and PEF2\u2009+\u2009O as the five best treatments.
