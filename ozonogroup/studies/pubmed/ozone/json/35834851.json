In this study, the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation chemical kinetic model based on reaction kinetic constants between O<sub>3</sub> (and \u2022OH) and pollutants, and pseudo-first order rate constants for pollutant adsorption was established. The model parameters were obtained via O<sub>3</sub> and p-chlorobenzonic acid decay curves, and adsorption kinetic experiments, respectively. Higher \u2022OH exposures were obtained at the expense of lower O<sub>3</sub> exposures during catalytic ozonation compared to simple ozonation. Importantly, the experimentally measured and model-predicted removal ratios correlated well in all reaction systems, with correlation coefficients above 0.950 in synthetic solution and 0.893-0.979 in secondary effluent. Furthermore, the model revealed that pollutants were degraded mainly by O<sub>3</sub> and/or \u2022OH oxidation during catalytic ozonation, while adsorption of pollutants on catalysts contributed negligibly. Hence, the degradation ratios of pollutants could be satisfactorily predicted using the simplified model based only on the O<sub>3</sub> and \u2022OH exposures in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation systems with low adsorption capacity catalysts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
