We determined that the bactericidal ability improved as the plasma gas temperature increased. Specifically, the bactericidal ability on E. coli of 80-\u2103 plasma was enhanced by as much as 6.3 times compared to that of 10-\u2103 plasma. The relationship between plasma gas temperature and the amount of hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone introduced into the solution was investigated. Our results also showed that each reactive species production increased by 2.1, 9.0, 1.6, and 17 times, respectively, with 80-\u2103 compared to 10-\u2103 plasma. The relationship between the bactericidal ability and amount of reactive species indicated that singlet oxygen and ozone introduced to the solution mostly influenced the bactericidal ability as the plasma gas temperature increased. We conclude that the plasma gas temperature is the crucial parameter for plasma sterilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FIRST, Tokyo Institute of Technology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawano", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takamatsu", "ForeName": "Toshihiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Infection Prevention and Control, Tokyo Healthcare University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumura", "ForeName": "Yuriko", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FIRST, Tokyo Institute of Technology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyahara", "ForeName": "Hidekazu", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Infection Prevention and Control, Tokyo Healthcare University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwasawa", "ForeName": "Atsuo", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FIRST, Tokyo Institute of Technology."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okino", "ForeName": "Akitoshi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biocontrol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9712121", "ISSNLinking": "1342-4815"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30584203", "10.4265/bio.23.167"]}}]}
