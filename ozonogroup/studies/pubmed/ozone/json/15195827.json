One monitoring site (rural) was located upwind of the Auckland urban complex, a second downwind (rural-coastal), and a third within the urban area, while the fourth was an elevated urban-city site located 250 m up the Sky Tower in the central city. In contrast to the high elevation site, the diurnal behaviour of ozone at the three low elevation sites followed a typical solar radiation cycle with high ozone during the day and low nocturnal values. The effect of NO(x) titration was distinct at the urban sites. There was also a seasonal variability in the measured ozone levels with high concentrations in spring and a significant summer minimum. The observed surface ozone concentrations in Auckland were significantly lower than other cities of the world, although a potential for high oxidant formation existed. Observed ozone episodes appear to have been either generated locally or the precursors transported via the prevailing southwest wind. A unique feature of Auckland's air quality is the dilution of polluted city air due to the mixing of east-coast air into the clean west-coast circulation leading to the overall lower average concentrations in summer. A second feature is the potential interaction between sea salt particles and ozone that may provide an additional ozone loss mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography and Environmental Science, Tamaki Campus, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adeeb", "ForeName": "Farah", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shooter", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New Zealand"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Titrimetry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2002 May;52(5):593-605", "ArticleIdList": ["12022698"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1990;63(3):189-224", "ArticleIdList": ["15092317"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 1999;100(1-3):19-42", "ArticleIdList": ["15093111"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1993 Mar 5;259(5100):1436-9", "ArticleIdList": ["17801277"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15195827", "10.1023/b:emas.0000029904.28706.c0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
