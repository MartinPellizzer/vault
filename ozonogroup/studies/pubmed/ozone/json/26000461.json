The fabrication sequences of nanochannels and microelectrodes were optimized. The oxygen plasma etching rate of PMMA nanochannels was studied, and the average rate was 15 nm/min under optimal conditions. An UV-ozone assisted thermal bonding method was developed to realize a low-temperature chip bonding, and the variations in width and depth of nanochannels before and after bonding were 2% and 5%, respectively. As a demonstration, a nanoparticle crystal (NPC)-based nanofluidic biosensor with integrated Ag microelectrodes was designed and fabricated. Sub-microchannel arrays with a depth of 400 nm and a width of 30 \u03bcm on the biosensor functioned as filters, and trapped 540 nm silica nanoparticles modified with streptavidin inside the connected microchannel to assemble the NPC. The interspaces in the NPC formed a three-dimensional nanochannel network with an equivalent diameter of 81 nm. By measuring the conductance across the NPC, a high quality nanofluidic sensing of biotin was achieved. The limit of detection was 1 aM, and the detection range was from 1 aM to 0.1 nM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
