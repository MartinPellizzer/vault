Treatment of supernatants derived from unstimulated human saliva specimens (n=12) with O3 (4.48 mmol) revealed that this reactive oxygen species gave rise to the oxidative consumption of pyruvate (generating acetate and CO2 as products), lactate (to pyruvate and sequentially acetate and CO2), carbohydrates in general (a process generating formate), methionine (giving rise to its corresponding sulphoxide), and urate (to allantoin). Further, minor O3-induced modifications included the oxidation of trimethylamine and 3-D-hydroxybutyrate, the fragmentation of salivary glycosaminoglycans to NMR-detectable saccharide fragments, and the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to their ozonides. Moreover, evidence for the ability of O3 to induce the release of selected low-molecular-mass salivary biomolecules from macromolecular binding-sites was also obtained. Since many of the oxidation products detectable in O3-treated samples are identical to those arising from the attack of *OH radical on biofluid components, it appears that at least some of the modifications observed here are attributable to the latter oxidant (derived from O3*- generated from the single electron reduction of O3)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Science, London South Bank University, 103 Borough Road, London, UK. grootvm@lsbu.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grootveld", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silwood", "ForeName": "Christopher J L", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynch", "ForeName": "Edward", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biofactors", "NlmUniqueID": "8807441", "ISSNLinking": "0951-6433"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8558G7RUTR", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dentistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17012760", "10.1002/biof.5520270102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
