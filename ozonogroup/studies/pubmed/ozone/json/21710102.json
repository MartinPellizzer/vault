A time series ecological study was conducted on subjects aged over 60 years and living in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, Brazil, with a population near 700,000 inhabitants. Hospital admission data of public health patients (SUS) were obtained from DATASUS for the period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006, according to the ICD-10 diagnoses I20 to I22 and I24. Particulate matter with less than 10 \u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide and ozone were the pollutants examined, and the control variables were mean temperature and relative humidity. Data on pollutants were obtained from the S\u00e3o Paulo State Sanitary Agency. The generalized linear model Poisson regression with lags of up to 5 days was used. There were 1303 hospital admissions during the period. Exposure to particulate matter was significantly associated with hospitalization for cardiovascular disease 3 days after exposure (RR = 1.006; 95%CI = 1.000 to 1.010) and an increase of 16 \u00b5g/m(3) was associated with a 10% increase in risk of hospitalization; other pollutants were not associated with hospitalization. Thus, it was possible to identify the role of exposure to particulate matter as an environmental pollutant in hospitalization for cardiovascular disease in a medium-sized city in Southeastern Brazil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Medicina and Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Ci\u00eancias Ambientais, Universidade de Taubat\u00e9, SP, Brasil. luiz.nascimento@unitau.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nascimento", "ForeName": "L F C", "Initials": "LF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Med Biol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8112917", "ISSNLinking": "0100-879X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Angina Pectoris"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidemiological Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Admission"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21710102", "10.1590/s0100-879x2011007500079", "S0100-879X2011007500079"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
