A difference in adherence is noticed between macrophages occurring in first or second lung washings. The latter are less sensitive to ozone stimulation. At ozone doses higher than 0.2 mg/m3, the effect disappears and is even negative for second-washing macrophages after exposure of rats to 0.8 mg/m3 (0.4 ppm). The increased activity observed after exposure to the lower levels of O3 is explained as a defensive reaction of the organism. Failure to stimulate activity or a decrease of activity, observed at the higher O3 concentrations, may point to adverse events."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veninga", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evelyn", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "7513622", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3712503", "10.1080/15287398609530887"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
