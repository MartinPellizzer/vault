The implications of such a year on the human well-being and health are therefore of multiple nature and can be quantified referring to the exceedances of the corresponding thresholds. This work focused on the analysis of the May-September period of 2015 in the city of Milan (Italy) in terms of Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index (MOCI) and ozone concentrations, recorded by monitoring stations and modeled through the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Main findings show that thermo-hygrometric stress events (periods of at least six consecutive days characterized by daily maximum values of the MOCI higher than 0.5) are characterized by daily ozone higher than the guideline level of the World Health Organization (equal to 100\u00a0\u03bcgm<sup>-3</sup>). This means that thermo-hygrometric stress conditions are added up to poor air quality conditions, with severe risks for human health. Moreover, a daily MOCI-daily ozone correlation coefficient equal to 0.6 was found for the whole period. The degree of correspondence between ozone events (defined according to the European Air Quality Directive) and MOCI events was also investigated pointing out that 86% and 95% of days during ozone events are correctly predicted by events of recorded and modeled MOCI respectively, with a corresponding false alarm rate of 3% and 9%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
