Unusual isomeric features in fatty acids of human foods such as conjugated double bonds or chain branching found in dairy products, some seeds and nuts, and marine foods potentially have important effects on human health. Recent advancements in identifying fatty acids with unusual double bond positions and pinpointing the position of methyl branches have empowered the study of their biological functions. We present recent advances in fatty acid structural elucidation by mass spectrometry in comparison with the more traditional methods. The double bond position can be determined by purely instrumental methods, specifically solvent-mediated covalent adduct chemical ionization (SM-CACI) and ozone induced dissociation (OzID), with charge inversion methods showing promise. Prior derivatization using the Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi (PB) reaction to yield stable structures that, upon collisional activation, yield the double bond position has emerged. The chemical ionization (CI) based three ion monitoring (MRM) method has been developed to simultaneously identify and quantify low-level branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs), unattainable by electron ionization (EI) based methods. Accurate identification and quantification of unusual fatty acid isomers has led to research progress in the discovery of biomarkers for cancer, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerosis. Modulation of eicosanoids, weight loss and the health significance of BCFAs are also presented. This review clearly shows that the improvement of analytical capacity is critical in the study of fatty acid biological functions, and stronger coupling of the methods discussed here with fatty acid mechanistic research is promising in generating more refined outcomes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5715-2193"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China. wangdh36@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China. wangdh36@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tingxiang", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9494-4245"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dell Pediatric Research Institute, Depts of Pediatrics, of Chemistry, and of Nutrition, University of Texas at Austin, 1400 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Austin, TX, USA. tbrenna@utexas.edu."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Brenna", "ForeName": "J Thomas", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9894-7459"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China. wangdh36@mail.sysu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong Hao", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38197562", "10.1039/d3fo03716a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
