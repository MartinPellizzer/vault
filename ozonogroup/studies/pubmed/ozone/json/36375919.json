In this work, CuO/Cu<sub>2</sub>O heterojunctioned catalyst is fabricated by heating Cu<sub>2</sub>O at high temperature, and is adopted as ozone decomposition catalyst. The results show that after Cu<sub>2</sub>O is heated at 180\u00b0C conversion of ozone increases from 75.2% to 89.3% at mass space velocity 1,920,000 cm<sup>3</sup>/(g\u00b7hr) in dry air with 1000 ppmV ozone, which indicates that this heterojunction catalyst is one of the most efficient catalysts reported at present. Catalysts are characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, which confirmed that the heterojunction promotes the electron transfer in the catalytic process and creates more defects and oxygen vacancies in the CuO/Cu<sub>2</sub>O interfaces. This procedure of manufacturing heterostructures would also be applicable to other metal oxide catalysts, and it is expected to be more widely applied to the synthesis of high-efficiency heterostructured catalysts in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
