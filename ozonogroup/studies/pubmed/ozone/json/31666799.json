Time series data for measured species generally displayed strong diurnal patterns. Six species show a diurnal pattern of daytime maximums (NO, NO<sub>y</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub>), while five species show a diurnal pattern of night time maximums (NO<sub>2</sub>, HONO, ClNO<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). Vector autoregression analyses were completed to better understand important species influencing the formation of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. For the species studied, r<sup>2</sup> values of predicted versus measured concentrations ranged from 0.82-0.99. Fitting parameters for the autoregressive matrix, \u03a0, indicated the importance of species precursors. In addition, values of fitting parameters for \u03a0 were relatively insensitive to data size, with variations generally <10%. Variable causation was quantified using the Granger causation method. Assuming O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> behave as chemical products, reactants (in order of importance) are as follows: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, HONO, and ClNO<sub>2</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "for submission to Atmospheric Environment Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.
