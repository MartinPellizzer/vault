The reaction between ozone and lung surfactant, which contains POPC, leads to decreased pulmonary function, but little is known about the changes that occur to the interfacial material as a result of oxidation. The results reveal that the initial reaction of ozone with POPC leads to a rapid increase in surface pressure followed by a slow decrease to very low values. The neutron reflection measurements, performed on an isotopologue of POPC with a selectively deuterated palmitoyl strand, reveal that the reaction leads to loss of this strand from the air-water interface, suggesting either solubilization of the product lipid or degradation of the palmitoyl strand by a reactive species. Reactions of (1)H-POPC on D(2)O reveal that the headgroup region of the lipids in aqueous solution is not dramatically perturbed by the reaction of POPC monolayers with ozone supporting degradation of the palmitoyl strand rather than solubilization. The results are consistent with the reaction of ozone with the oleoyl strand of POPC at the air-water interface leading to the formation of OH radicals. The highly reactive OH radicals produced can then go on to react with the saturated palmitoyl strands leading to the formation of oxidized lipids with shorter alkyl tails."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, Malet Street, London, WC1E 7HX, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Katherine C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rennie", "ForeName": "Adrian R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "King", "ForeName": "Martin D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hardman", "ForeName": "Samantha J O", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lucas", "ForeName": "Claire O M", "Initials": "CO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfrang", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "Brian R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "Arwel V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxononanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2644-64-6", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE895536Y5", "NameOfSubstance": "1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutron Diffraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20883049", "10.1021/la1022714"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
