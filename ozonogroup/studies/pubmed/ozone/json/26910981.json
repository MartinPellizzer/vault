The result showed that the model was capable of reproducing the temporal and spatial distribution and evolution characteristics of the typical summer ozone pollution event over YRD. The YRD region was mainly affected by the subtropical high-pressure control, and the weather conditions of sunshine, high temperature and small wind were favorable for the formation of photochemical pollution on August 10-18, 2013. The results of simulation showed that the spatial and temporal distribution of O3 was obviously affected by the meteorological fields, geographic location, regional transport and chemical formation over YRD. The sensitivity experiment showed that the O3 concentration affected by maritime airstream was low in Shanghai, but the impact of Shanghai emissions on the spatial and temporal distribution of O3 concentration over YRD was significant; The main contribution of the high concentration of O3 in Nanjing surface was chemical generation ( alkene and aromatic) and the vertical transport from high-altitude O3, whereas the main contribution of the high concentration of O3 in Hangzhou and Suzhou was physics process. The influence of the 15:00 peak concentration of O3 over YRD was very obvious when O3 precursor was reduced at the maximum O3 formation rate (11-13 h)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jin-hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Han-qing", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-lei", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-e", "Initials": "YE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26910981"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
