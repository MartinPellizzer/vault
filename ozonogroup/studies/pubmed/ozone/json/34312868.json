Flavanone 3\u03b2-hydroxylase (F3H) was used as a marker of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. The activity of F3H, the expression of gene encoding F3H and the antioxidant status in blueberries treated with ozone at a concentration of 15\u2009ppm for 30\u2009min, every 12\u2009h of storage, and maintained at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u2009weeks were investigated.", "The results showed that ozonation process increases the expression of the F3H gene after 1\u00a0week of storage, which translates into a higher catalytic capacity of protein, as well as a higher content of flavonoids and total antioxidant potential of ozonated blueberries compared to non-ozonated fruits.", "The present study provides experimental evidence indicating that ozone treatment in proposed process conditions positively affects flavonoid metabolism in highbush blueberry fruit leading to the maintainance of the high quality of the fruit during storage. \u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5579-1629"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Food Toxicology, Institute of Food Technology and Nutrition, University of Rzeszow, St. Cwiklinskiej 1A, Rzeszow, 35-601, Poland."}], "LastName": "Piechowiak", "ForeName": "Tomasz", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7833-9985"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Cell Biology, Medical College, University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow, St. Sucharskiego 2, Rzeszow, 35-225, Poland."}], "LastName": "Sk\u00f3ra", "ForeName": "Bartosz", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3593-2620"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioenergetics, Food Analysis and Microbiology, Institute of Food Technology and Nutrition, University of Rzeszow, St. Zelwerowicza 4, Rzeszow, 35-601, Poland."}], "LastName": "Sowa", "ForeName": "Patrycja", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2019/35/B/NZ9/01552", "Agency": "Narodowe Centrum Nauki", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.11.9", "NameOfSubstance": "flavanone 3-dioxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Blueberry Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Storage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Piechowiak T, Antos P, J\u00f3zefczyk R, Kosowski P, Skrobacz K and Balawejder M, Impact of ozonation process on the microbiological contamination and antioxidant capacity of highbush blueberry (Vaccinum corymbosum L.) fruit during cold storage.
