In this study, the performance of various leachate treatment sequences to remove COD and nitrogen from a leachate stream and the associated cost are presented. The results show that, to achieve 100% nitrogen removal, autotrophic nitrogen removal (ANR) or a combination of ANR and nitrification - denitrification (N-dN) is more cost effective than using only the N-dN process (0.58\u00a0\u20ac/m<sup>3</sup>) without changing the leachate polishing costs associated with granular activated carbon (GAC). Treatment of N-dN effluent by ozonation or coagulation led to the reduction of the COD concentration by 10% and 59% respectively before GAC adsorption. This reduced GAC costs and subsequently reduced the overall treatment costs by 7% (ozonation) and 22% (coagulation). On the contrary, using Fenton oxidation to reduce the COD concentration of N-dN effluent by 63% increased the overall leachate treatment costs by 3%. Leachate treatment sequences employing ANR for nitrogen removal followed by ozonation or Fenton or coagulation for COD removal and final polishing with GAC are on average 33% cheaper than a sequence with N-dN\u00a0+\u00a0GAC only. When ANR is the preceding step and GAC the final step, choice of AOP i.e., ozonation or Fenton did not affect the total treatment costs which amounted to 1.43 (ozonation) and 1.42\u00a0\u20ac/m<sup>3</sup> (Fenton). In all the investigated leachate treatment trains, the sequence with ANR\u00a0+\u00a0coagulation\u00a0+\u00a0GAC is the most cost effective at 0.94\u00a0\u20ac/m<sup>3</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
