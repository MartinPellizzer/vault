Up to 10 controls were matched to every case by age, gender and ethnicity, in all 362 cases and 3512 controls. Measurements of pollutants' concentrations, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and particulate matter of size less than 10 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), as well as the mean daily measurements of meteorological conditions were obtained from the local monitoring stations. The association between T1D and pollution, solar radiation (SR), temperature and relative humidity was adjusted for socioeconomic status, temperature, maternal age and pre-gestational maternal DM, using conditional logistic regression. The environmental exposures were presented as indicators of quartiles averaged over whole pregnancy and by trimesters.", "Exposure to ozone and solar radiation during gestation were both associated with the T1D in offspring, although at borderline significance. Compared to the lowest quartile, the odds ratio (OR) for exposure to 3rd and 4th quartile of O<sub>3</sub> was equal 1.61 (95%CI: 0.95; 2.73) and 1.45 (95%CI: 0.83; 2.53), respectively. Likewise, the ORs for exposure to SR were equal 1.83 (95%CI: 0.92; 3.64), 2.54 (95%CI: 1.21; 5.29) and 2.06 (95%CI: 0.95; 4.45) for to 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles, respectively. Exposure to SO<sub>2</sub> followed a dose-response pattern, but was not statistically significant. Other environmental factors were not independently related to T1D. Analysis of exposures one year prior to the disease onset indicated a positive association between T1D and SR.", "We showed that exposure to high ozone levels and solar radiation during gestation might be related to the T1D.
