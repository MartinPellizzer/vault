The use of methyl bromide (MB) should be reduced because it has phytotoxic and ozone depleting properties. In the present study, fumigations with mixtures of gaseous phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub> ) and MB were conducted to disinfest B. dorsalis. The effect of combined fumigation on postharvest quality of Nanfeng mandarin fruit was then evaluated.", "There was a clear synergistic effect between MB and PH<sub>3</sub> against B. dorsalis at 20\u2009\u00b0C. The third-instar larvae of B. dorsalis were the most tolerant to treatment with both MB alone and combined with PH<sub>3</sub> . Toxicity assay of third instars indicated that higher PH<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased MB toxicity, and 1.42-2.84\u2009g\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> of PH<sub>3</sub> was optimal when combined with MB. Probit analysis showed that, combined with 2.13\u2009g\u2009m<sup>-3</sup> PH<sub>3</sub> , similar mortality was achieved with 50% of the MB required when applied alone. Furthermore, the fruit quality test showed that MB fumigation resulted in a higher respiration rate and >40% fruit rot after storage. The combined treatment reduced these effects and did not have adverse effects on fruit firmness, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, or vitamin C content.", "Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effect between PH<sub>3</sub> and MB and indicate that this treatment has potential as a novel strategy for postharvest control of B. dorsalis, especially in MB-sensitive fruit. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Equipment Technology, Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Equipment Technology, Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guangping", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Equipment Technology, Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Baishu", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Quarantine Technology Centre, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, Gimcheon, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jeong Oh", "Initials": "JO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Quarantine Technology Centre, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, Gimcheon, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Min-Goo", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Equipment Technology, Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Australia."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-4111-7961"], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017YFF0210204", "Agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018JK025", "Agency": "Scientific Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FW6947296I", "NameOfSubstance": "phosphine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insect Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tephritidae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Liu Y, Heying E and Tanumihardjo SA, History, global distribution, and nutritional importance of citrus fruit.
