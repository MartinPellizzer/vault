Kudzu also emits isoprene, a hydrocarbon which can significantly affect atmospheric chemistry including reactions leading to tropospheric ozone. We have studied physiological aspects of isoprene emission from kudzu so the ecological consequences of isoprene emission can be better understood. We examined: (a) the development of isoprene emission as leaves developed, (b) the interaction between photon flux density and temperature effects on isoprene emission, (c) isoprene emission during and after water stress, and (d) the induction of isoprene emission from leaves grown at low temperature by water stress or elevated temperature. Isoprene emission under standard conditions of 1000 \u03bcmol photons\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> and 30\u00b0C developed only after the leaf had reached full expansion, and was not complete until up to two weeks past the point of full expansion of the leaf. The effect of temperature on isoprene emission was much greater than found for other species, with a 10\u00b0C increase in temperature causing a eight-fold increase in the rate of isoprene emission. Isoprene emission from kudzu was stimulated by increases in photon flux density up to 3000 \u03bcmol photons\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup>. In contrast, photosynthesis of kudzu was saturated at less than 1000 \u03bcmol\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> photon flux density and was reduced at high temperature, so that up to 20% of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis was reemitted as isoprene gas at 1000 \u03bcmol photons\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> and 35\u00b0C. Withholding water caused photosynthesis to decline nearly to zero after several days but had a much smaller effect on isoprene emission. Following the relief of water stress, photosynthesis recovered to the prestress level but isoprene emission increased to about five times the prestress rate. At 1000 \u03bcmol photons\u00b7m<sup>-2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>-1</sup> and 35\u00b0C as much as 67% of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis was reemitted as isoprene eight days after water stress. Leaves grown at less than 20\u00b0C did not make isoprene until an inductive treatment was given. Inductive treatments included growth at 24\u00b0C, leaf temperature of 30\u00b0C for 5 h, or witholding water from plants. With the new information on temperature and water stress effects on isoprene emission, we speculate that isoprene emission may help plants cope with stressful conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin, 53706-1383, Madison, WI, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharkey", "ForeName": "Thomas D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin, 53706-1383, Madison, WI, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loreto", "ForeName": "Francesco", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Mar;98(3):1175-80", "ArticleIdList": ["16668743"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Pollut Control Assoc. 1972 Jul;22(7):537-43", "ArticleIdList": ["5040345"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1993 Mar;189(3):420-4", "ArticleIdList": ["24178500"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1988 Sep 16;241(4872):1473-5", "ArticleIdList": ["3420404"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1993 Feb;101(2):435-440", "ArticleIdList": ["12231698"]}, {"Citation": "J Lipid Res. 1980 Jul;21(5):505-17", "ArticleIdList": ["6995544"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1990 Nov;182(4):523-31", "ArticleIdList": ["24197372"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1989 May;90(1):267-74", "ArticleIdList": ["16666747"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Sep;97(1):170-4", "ArticleIdList": ["16668365"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Dec;97(4):1588-91", "ArticleIdList": ["16668590"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1992 May 22;256(5060):1157-65", "ArticleIdList": ["1317061"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1987 Jan;71(2):262-267", "ArticleIdList": ["28312254"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28314006", "10.1007/BF00320984", "10.1007/BF00320984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
