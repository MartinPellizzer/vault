The widely reported manganese-based catalysts for ozone decomposition still facing the persisting issues encompass inefficiency and instability. To surmount these challenges, we developed a mesoporous silica thin films with perpendicular nanochannels (SBA(\u22a5)) confined Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst (Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@SBA(\u22a5)). Under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 500,000\u00a0mL\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, the Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@SBA(\u22a5) catalyst exhibited 100% ozone decomposition efficiency in 5\u00a0h and stability across a wide humidity range, which exceed the performance of bulk Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> confine in commonly reported SBA-15. Rapidly decompose 20\u00a0ppm O<sub>3</sub> to a safety level below 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> in the presence of dust in smog chamber (60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060\u00a0cm) was also realized. This prominent catalytic performance can be attributed to the unique confined structure engenders the highly exposed active sites, facilitate the reactant-active sites contact and impeded the water accumulation on the active sites. This work offers new insights into the design of confined structure catalysts for air purification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
