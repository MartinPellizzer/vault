A novel degradation system integrating ozone, microchannel, and ultrasound was designed to effectively degrade azo dye-contaminated wastewater. The effects of discharge voltage of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, liquid flow rate, microchannel width, ultrasonic power, initial pH, and reaction temperature on methylene blue (MB) decolorization were studied. A maximum MB decolorization efficiency of 92.7% was obtained in the ozone/microchannel/ultrasound (O<sub>3</sub>/MC/US) system with 14 min of treatment. In addition, the 14-min decolorization efficiency and TOC removal efficiency obtained in O<sub>3</sub>/MC/US system were increased by 12.6 and 6.5%, respectively, compared to those obtained in the pure O<sub>3</sub> system. Based on the results of scavenging experiments, the combined effects of microchannel and ultrasound were proved to improve the contribution rate of hydroxyl radicals, thus improving the decolorization efficiency. The present work clearly illustrates that ozonation degradation can be effectively enhanced by microchannel and ultrasound, and also provides a feasible method for the treatment of organic wastewater."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Food Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province 214122, China yujf@jiangnan.edu.cn; School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province 214122, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huiyang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Food Manufacturing Equipment & Technology, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province 214122, China yujf@jiangnan.edu.cn; School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province 214122, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jianfeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengxian College, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 210088, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiangyu", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Wastewater"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T42P99266K", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylene Blue"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylene Blue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36789706", "10.2166/wst.2023.021"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
