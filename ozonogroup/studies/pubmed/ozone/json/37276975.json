One-year (Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2021) hourly mass concentrations data of 54 VOCs, NO<sub>X</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> from 10 photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMs) in and around the Yunlin County were analyzed. The novelty of the study lies in the utilization of artificial neural network (ANN) to evaluate the contribution of VOCs sources in O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the region. Firstly, the station specific source-apportionment of VOCs were carried out using positive matrix factorization (PMF)-resolving six sources viz. AAM: aged air mass, CM: chemical manufacturing, IC: Industrial combustion, PP: petrochemical plants, SU: solvent use and VE: vehicular emissions. AAM, SU, and VE constituted cumulatively more than 65% of the total emission of VOCs across all 10\u00a0PAMs. Diurnal and spatial variability of source-segregated VOCs showed large variations across 10\u00a0PAMs, suggesting for distinctly different impact of contributing sources, photo-chemical reactivity, and/or dispersion due to land-sea breezes at the monitoring stations. Secondly, to understand the contribution of controllable factors governing the O<sub>3</sub> pollution, the output of VOCs source-contributions from PMF model along with mass concentrations of NO<sub>X</sub> were standardized and first time used as input variables to ANN, a supervised machine learning algorithm. ANN analysis revealed following order of sensitivity in factors governing the O<sub>3</sub> pollution: VOCs from IC\u00a0>\u00a0AAM\u00a0>\u00a0VE\u00a0\u2248\u00a0CM\u00a0\u2248\u00a0SU\u00a0>\u00a0PP\u00a0\u2248\u00a0NO<sub>X</sub>. The results indicated that VOCs associated with IC (VOCs-IC) being the most sensitive factor which need to be regulated more efficiently to quickly mitigate the O<sub>3</sub> pollution across the Yunlin County."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
