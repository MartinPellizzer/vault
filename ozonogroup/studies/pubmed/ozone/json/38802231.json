Phenylalanine (Phe) was used as the target amino acid to comprehensively investigate variability of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation during chlorine disinfection and residual chlorine conditions subsequent to ozonation. The results showed that subsequent to ozonation, the typical regulated and unregulated DBPs formation potential (DBPsFP), including trichloromethane (TCM), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), chloral hydrate (CH), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), and trichloroacetamide (TCAcAm) increased substantially, by 2.4, 3.3, 5.6, 1.2, 2.5, and 6.0 times, respectively, compared with only chlorination. Ozonation also significantly increased the DBPs yield under a 2 day simulated residual chlorine condition that mimicked the water distribution system. DBPs formations followed pseudo first order kinetics. The formation rates of DBPs in the first 6 hr were higher for TCM (0.214 hr<sup>-1</sup>), DCAN (0.244 hr<sup>-1</sup>), CH (0.105 hr<sup>-1</sup>), TCAcAm (0.234 hr<sup>-1</sup>), DCAA (0.375 hr<sup>-1</sup>) and TCAA (0.190 hr<sup>-1</sup>) than thereafter. The peak DBPsFP of TCM, DCAN, CH, TCAcAm, DCAA, and TCAA were obtained when that ozonation time was set at 5-15 min. Ozonation times > 30 min increased the mineralization of Phe and decreased the formation of DBPs upon chlorination. Increasing bromine ion (Br<sup>-</sup>) concentration increased production of bromine- DBPs and decreased chlorine-DBPs formation by 59.3%-92.2% . Higher ozone dosages and slight alkaline favored to reduce DBP formation and cytotoxicity. The ozonation conditions should be optimized for all application purposes including DBPs reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
