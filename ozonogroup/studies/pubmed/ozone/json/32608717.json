Results showed that the annual mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration of a maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) was 108 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in the Henan Province with the trend of summer > spring > autumn > winter. Different levels of O<sub>3</sub> were observed in various cities. The number of days exceeding the standard was up to 88 days in Anyang, while the lowest was found in Xinyang with 17 days. The most severe of O<sub>3</sub> pollution occurred during late spring and early summer. During this period, the average monthly concentration of O<sub>3</sub> MDA8 was above 140 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, and peaked in June. The qualitative and quantitative analysis showed that the monthly average concentration of O<sub>3</sub> MDA8 was negatively correlated with particulate matter, and the O<sub>3</sub> hourly concentration was also negatively correlated with CO and NO<sub>2</sub>. The O<sub>3</sub> MDA8 concentration and meteorological factors (sunshine duration, temperature, rainfall, visibility, humidity, and wind speed) had different correlations during different seasons and various cities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Yan-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shi-Jie", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Sha-Sha", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Meteorological Service, Zhengzhou 450003, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Jia-He", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Environmental Science, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui-Qin", "Initials": "RQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32608717", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201908122"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
