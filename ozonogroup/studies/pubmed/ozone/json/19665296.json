The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo gravimetric (TG) analysis, and N(2) adsorption/desorption measurements (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method). The influence of calcination temperature on the catalytic activities, and the lifetime test of the catalyst pretreated at 350 degrees C had been studied. XRD and TG results show that when calcined in the temperature range of 300-450 degrees C, manganese carbonate (MnCO(3)) is partly decomposed to MnOx (x=1.6-2.0) species in the catalysts. However, when calcined at 500 degrees C, MnOx partly turns into Mn(2)O(3) in the catalyst. The catalytic activity test indicates that the catalysts calcined at 300-400 degrees C exhibit the best performance for O(3) decomposition, and the completely conversion temperature of ozone (T(100)) is in the region of 30-35 degrees C, which is lower than surface temperature of water tanks of running automobile. Under gas hour space velocity (GHSV) of 635,000h(-1) and reaction temperature of 40 degrees C, after lifetime test for 80 h, the catalyst calcined at 350 degrees C keeps 90% conversion, which indicates that they have excellent ability to resist deactivation. The catalysts calcined at 300-400 degrees C show great potential to be applied at lower temperature, especially in winter and at the stage of automobile engine cold start."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry & Technology of the Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Quanwei", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhimin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianli", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yaoqiang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Maochu", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5TWQ1V240M", "NameOfSubstance": "Palladium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9ZV57512ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "manganese carbonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Palladium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19665296", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.07.040", "S0304-3894(09)01156-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
