During the last year, mechanistic advances occurred in understanding type 2 innate lymphoid cells, particularly related to their response to ozone, involvement with experimental food allergy responses, and regulation by IL-33. Novel ways of regulating T<sub>H</sub>2 cells through epigenetic regulation of GATA-3 through sirtuin-1, a class III histone deacetylase, were published. The understanding of eicosanoid regulation of inflammation increased and focused on additional properties of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and the role of prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> and its receptors and inhibitory prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> pathways. Mechanisms through which extracellular vesicles are released and contribute to allergic responses were reported. There was a deeper appreciation of mucosal barrier function, the epithelial alarmin IL-33, and the microbiome. Finally, there were advances concerning allergic inflammatory cells (mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils) that will undoubtedly have an effect on disease understanding and new therapeutic strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
