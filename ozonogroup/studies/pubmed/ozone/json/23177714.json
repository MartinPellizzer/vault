The rate constants of OMT reacting with ozone and hydroxyl radical ((\u00b7)OH) were determined to be 0.04 and 5.3\u00d710(8) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7.5 and 20 \u00b0C, respectively. OMT was predominantly degraded by ()OH in the catalytic ozonation with Fe@AC. The high-molecular-weight degradation byproducts identified were O,O,O-trimethyl phosphoric ester (TMP), pyrrolidin-2-one, N-methyl-2-sulfanylacetamide, 2-(methylthio)acetamide, O,O,S-trimethylthiophosphate (STMP), and N-methyl-2-(methylthio)acetamide. Besides, low-molecular-weight organic acids and inorganic anions were also detected and quantified, including formic, acetic and oxalic acids as well as nitrate, sulfate and phosphate ions. In the catalytic ozonation, TMP and phosphate were two major P-containing byproducts resulting from OMT degradation. The toxicity of OMT solution gradually decreased during the catalytic ozonation, indicating that Fe@AC is a safe catalyst for OMT removal by ozone in water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
