Average ambient ozone concentration was 60\u202fppb which was more than sufficient to cause phytotoxic effects. EDU treatment resulted in less lipid peroxidation along with increased chlorophyll content, biomass and yield. EDU alleviated the negative effects of ozone by enhancing activities of antioxidants and antioxidative enzymes. Two dimensional electrophoresis (2DGE) analysis revealed massive changes in protein abundance in Kundan at vegetative stage (50% proteins were increased, 20% were decreased) and at flowering stage (25% increased, 18% decreased). In PBW 343\u202fat both the developmental stages about 15% proteins were increased whereas 20% were decreased in abundance. Higher abundance of proteins related to carbon metabolism, defense and photorespiration conferred tolerance to EDU treated Kundan. In PBW343, EDU provided incomplete protection as evidenced by low abundance of many primary metabolism related proteins. Proteomic changes in response to EDU treatment in two varieties are discussed in relation to growth and yield."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
