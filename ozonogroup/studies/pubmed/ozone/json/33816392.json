Various factors such as malocclusion, trauma, stress, parafunctional habits (clenching and bruxing), osteoarthritis, and synovitis play a role in its occurrence, although the etiology of these disorders is little understood. Several treatments are being used to treat these disorders. Ozone therapy has been recently introduced as one of these treatments. Considering that no extensive study has been found in this field so far, this study is aiming to report the studies that have been conducted to determine the efficacy of ozone injection therapy in temporomandibular joint disorders. This report addresses the studies which are conducted clinically, experimentally, and semi-experimentally over the past 10 years (2009-2019). The prepared articles are screened according to the inclusion criteria. In this study, total six related articles are addressed. One study was pre- and postintervention, and five studies were clinical trials. Studies show that although more studies are needed in contrast with occlusal splint, ozone therapy is generally more effective treatment for pain reduction compared to medication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Advanced Biomedical Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Haghighat", "ForeName": "Sheila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Oshaghi", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Adv Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101586897", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9175"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Singh V, Sudhakar KNV, Mallela KK, Mohanty R.
