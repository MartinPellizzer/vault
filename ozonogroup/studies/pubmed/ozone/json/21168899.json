Photochemical pollution was detected during the measurement on Aug 2, 2008, and the maximum hourly average [O(3)] reached 128ppbv, caused by both the local photochemical reactions and regional transportation of pollutants. The NO(x) Ozone Production Efficiency (OPE (NO(x))) values were 6.9 and 20.2 on Aug 2 and Aug 24, 2008 respectively, which were the two days with highest O(3) pollution. The OPE (NO(x)) of 6.9 on Aug 2 was within a typical range in city area, and it implied that the high O(3) could be due to local sources. While OPE (NO(x)) of 20.2 on Aug 24 was larger than the typical value in the region, but lower than that of the surrounding clean area during 2008 Beijing Olympics Closing Ceremony. It indicated that the pollution was because of regional transportation of pollutants. In addition, 60% of the extent of the Smog Production Model (SPM) data was less than 0.6 and the rest was slightly larger than 0.6, with maximum of 0.78. It indicated that the sensitivity of O(3) generated was volatile organic compounds (VOCs) control during the observation period. The SPM results also implied that O(3) product in high-O(3) day is a transition state from VOCs sensitivity to NO(x) sensitivity. Lastly, the analysis of the wind direction and extent of SPM showed that the photochemical pollution of this region was mostly subject to the influence of southeastern air flow in the summer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.
