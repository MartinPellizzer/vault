Also, the antimicrobial efficiency of aqueous ozone increases with an increase in its concentration and exposure time, but with a detrimental effect on the quality of the treated food. In this study, the effect of aqueous ozone at low concentration, multi-mode frequency irradiation and their combination on microbial safety and nutritional quality of cherry tomato was investigated. Individual washing with aqueous ozone and mono-mode frequency irradiation resulted in <1 log CFU/g reduction in the spoilage microorganisms, while dual-mode frequency irradiation (DMFI) resulted in higher microbial reduction (1.3-2.6 1 log CFU/g). The combined system (20/40\u00a0kHz\u00a0+\u00a0aqueous ozone) on the other hand, resulted in >3 log CFU/g microbial reduction. The application of DMFI enhanced the antimicrobial efficiency of aqueous ozone without any detrimental effect on the physicochemical properties (except the firmness), bioactive compounds, and antioxidants of the cherry tomato during 21\u00a0days refrigerated storage. The result obtained indicates the promising substitute to the single washing technique for microbial safety as well as preserving the nutritional quality and enhancing the shelf life of cherry tomato."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
