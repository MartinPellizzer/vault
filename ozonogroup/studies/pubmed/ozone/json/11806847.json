COPD is caused by cigarette smoking, evidenced by deterioration in lung function. Lung function is only rarely assessed in animal models. A cigarette smoke driven pathology should provide the best in vivo model for COPD. However, as lesions produced this way take 8-12 months to develop other strategies have to be employed. Emphysematous lesions were also achieved by treatment with elastase, lipopolysaccharide, ozone and other inducers. Several studies described treatments that have shown activity in these models. Transgenic models were discussed, as was the importance of species and strain selection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Respiratory Pharmacology Group, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, National Heart and Lung Institute, London, UK. d.hele@ic.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hele", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Congress"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Respir Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101090633", "ISSNLinking": "1465-9921"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "genetics", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Massaro GD, Massaro D.
