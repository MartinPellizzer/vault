The flight path from Moffett Field, California (37 degrees N, 121 degrees W), to Great Slave Lake, Canada (61 degrees N, 115 degrees W), extended to the center of the polar jet associated with but outside of the Arctic vortex, in which the abundance of O(3) was twice its mid-latitude value, whereas BrO levels were 5 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) between 18 and 21 kilometers, and 2.4 pptv below that altitude. The ClO mixing ratio was as much as 65 pptv at 60 degrees N latitude at an altitude of 20 kilometers, and was enhanced over mid-latitude values by a factor of 3 to 5 at altitudes above 18 kilometers and by as much as a factor of 40 at altitudes below 17 kilometers. Levels of ClO and O(3) were highly correlated on all measured distance scales, and both showed an abrupt change in character at 54 degrees N latitude. The enhancement of ClO abundance north of 54 degrees N was most likely caused by low nitrogen dioxide levels in the flight path."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brune", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toohey", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Starr", "ForeName": "W L", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vedder", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Danielsen", "ForeName": "E F", "Initials": "EF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17815896", "10.1126/science.242.4878.558", "242/4878/558"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
