Average daily (0800-2000 hours) O3 concentrations in the CF. NF. NF 1.5 and NF 20 treatments were. 29. 47, 76 and 98 nl 1(-1) . respectively, for the 140 d treatment period. At the end of the treatment period, total phenolic and proanthocyanidin concentrations in the previous year's needles were 25-29% higher in the NF 2.0 treatment compared with the lower O3 treatments. Catechin concentration increased in the previous year's needles by as much as 81 % between the NF 2.0 treatment and the lower O3 treatments. Catechin is an effective antioxidant, and elevated levels might confer some protection against O3 injury. No significant differences in total phenolics and proanthocyanidins in the previous year's needles were detected among the remaining treatments, or among any O3 treatment for the current year's needles. Lignin content in needles of both years was not significantly affected by O3 exposure. Chances in the phenolic content of older needles in response to elevated O3 could alter plant-pathogen interactions and slow down microbiol decomposition, which could contribute to a decline in site soil quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Program and Department of Crop Science, Box 7632, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USADepartment of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, FinlandU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Program, and Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "F L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Program and Department of Crop Science, Box 7632, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USADepartment of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, FinlandU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Program, and Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anttonen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Program and Department of Crop Science, Box 7632, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USADepartment of Ecology and Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, FinlandU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Program, and Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heagle", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26763644", "10.1111/j.1469-8137.1996.tb01868.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
