Since the discovery of RNS formation in sunlit surface waters, these reactive intermediates have been detected in numerous sunlit natural waters and engineered water treatment systems. This critical review summarizes what is known regarding RNS, including their formation, contributions to contaminant transformation, and products resulting from RNS reactions. Reaction mechanisms and rate constants have been described for nitrogen dioxide (\u02d9NO<sub>2</sub>) reacting with phenolic compounds. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding reactions of RNS with other types of organic compounds. Promising methods to quantify RNS concentrations and reaction rates include the use of selective quenchers and probe compounds as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, high resolution mass spectrometry methods have enabled the identification of nitr(os)ated byproducts that form <i>via</i> RNS reactions in sunlit surface waters, UV-based treatment systems, treatment systems that employ chemical oxidants such as chlorine and ozone, and certain types of biological treatment processes. Recommendations are provided for future research to increase understanding of RNS reactions and products, and the implications for drinking water toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5450-8377"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z4, Canada. rachel.scholes@ubc.ca."}], "LastName": "Scholes", "ForeName": "Rachel C", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Process Impacts", "NlmUniqueID": "101601576", "ISSNLinking": "2050-7887"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drinking Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Nitrogen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drinking Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Nitrogen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "57"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35546580", "10.1039/d2em00102k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
