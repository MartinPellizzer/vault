We synthesized observations of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors in two summer months of 2020 at 10 sites in the Zhejiang province, East China and simulated the in situ photochemistry. O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the northeastern Zhejiang province was more serious than that in the southwest. The site-average daytime O<sub>3</sub> increment correlated well (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.73) with the total reactivity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide toward the hydroxyl radical (OH) in urban areas. Model simulation revealed that the main function of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>) at the rural sites where isoprene accounted for >85% of OH reactivity of VOCs was to facilitate the radical cycling. With NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reduction from 0 to 90%, the self-reactions between peroxy radicals (Self-Rxns), a proven pathway for secondary organic aerosol formation, were intensified by up to 23-fold in a NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-rich environment. In contrast, reducing VOCs could weaken the Self-Rxns while reducing O<sub>3</sub> production rate and atmospheric oxidation capacity. This study observes and simulates O<sub>3</sub> chemistry based on extensive measurements in typical Chinese cities, highlighting the necessity of reducing VOCs for co-benefit of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3306-1008"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong 00000, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Xiaopu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7996-7294"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong 00000, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Centre, Hangzhou 310012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Ecological and Environmental Monitoring, Forewarning and Quality Control, Hangzhou 3100212, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Qiaoli", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9181-3562"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong 00000, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Enyu", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong 00000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Beining", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong 00000, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Peiwen", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Institute for Earth System Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Centre, Hangzhou 310012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Ecological and Environmental Monitoring, Forewarning and Quality Control, Hangzhou 3100212, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Xudong", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36314604", "10.1021/acs.est.2c04340"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
