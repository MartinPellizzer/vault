It is well-established that these nanocrystals can be readily synthesized with specific shapes using colloidal methods in solutions containing capping agents. However, these capping agents tend to reduce the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts. Therefore, it is imperative to remove these agents without altering the morphology to enhance catalytic efficiency. In this study, we developed a method for eliminating melamine, a common capping agent, from supported Au nanoflowers using water extraction and ultraviolet-ozone treatment. This process significantly enhances the catalytic performance, particularly for alcohol oxidation reactions such as the conversion of 1-phenylethyl alcohol to acetophenone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science."}], "LastName": "Imura", "ForeName": "Yoshiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science."}], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "Haruna", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science."}], "LastName": "Jino", "ForeName": "Yuta", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science."}], "LastName": "Akiyama", "ForeName": "Ryota", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Ochanomizu University."}], "LastName": "Morita-Imura", "ForeName": "Clara", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Science."}], "LastName": "Kawai", "ForeName": "Takeshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39168624", "10.5650/jos.ess24106"]}}]}
