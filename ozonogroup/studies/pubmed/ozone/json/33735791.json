Although previous studies have reported that nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) promote pollen allergy, the specific biological processes and underlying mechanisms remain less understood. In this study, Platanus pollen grains were exposed to gaseous pollutants (NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>). We employed environmental electron microscopy, flow cytometry, western blot assay, enzyme-linked immunoassay, ultraviolet absorption spectrometry, circular dichroism, and protein mass spectrometry to characterise the subpollen particles (SPPs) released from pollen grains. Furthermore, we determined the immunogenicity and pathogenicity induced by Platanus pollen allergen a 3 (Pla a 3). Our results demonstrated that NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> could damage the pollen cell membranes in SPPs and increase the amount of Pla a 3 allergen released into the atmosphere. Additionally, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> altered the structure of Pla a3 protein through nitrification and oxidation, which not only enhanced the immunogenicity of allergens but also increased the stability of the protein. In\u00a0vivo analysis using an animal model indicated that NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> greatly aggravated pollen-induced pneumonia. Thus, our study provides guidance for the prevention of pollen allergic diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
