In this paper, degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen wastewater by the system of ultrasound/Mg/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/ozone (US/Mg/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>) was carried out. The effects of different influencing factors, such as initial pH of the solution, reaction time, temperature, catalyst addition, ozone flow rate, and ultrasonic intensity, on the degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen wastewater were investigated. The optimum reaction conditions were determined. The combination of ultrasonic technology and ozone oxidation technology can enhance the mass transfer of ozone and generate a large amount of HO. Due to Mg/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst has large surface area, the number of reactive sites and reaction molecule transport channels per unit area increases, resulting in the increase of HO on the surface, thus improving the catalytic activity. The introduction of ultrasound promotes the cleavage of N-H bonds on the catalyst surface, thereby promoting the degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen in the water. Results prove that there is not only a synergistic effect between ultrasound and catalytic ozone oxidation, but a strengthening effect of ultrasound on catalytic ozone oxidation. The research carried out in this paper provides a theoretical basis for the degradation of ammoniacal nitrogen in water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
