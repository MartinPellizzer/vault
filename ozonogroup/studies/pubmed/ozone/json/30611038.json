Herein, for the first time, we explored four environmental-benign iron-based MOFs (Fe-MOFs) for the catalytic ozonation reaction. These Fe-MOFs were characterized by PXRD, FT-IR, SEM, XPS, N<sub>2</sub> sorption-desorption isotherms and chemisorbed-pyridine IR. All Fe-MOFs show high catalytic performances with their intrinsic Lewis acid sites (LAS). Furthermore, MIL-53(Fe) demonstrates the highest catalytic activity because of its largest amount of LAS and suitable porosity-derived attractive mass-transfer property. The Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation kinetic rate is calculated to be 5.76 min<sup>-1</sup> with MIL-53(Fe), while 1.82 min<sup>-1</sup> with MIL-88B(Fe), 1.40 min<sup>-1</sup> with MIL-101(Fe), 0.87 min<sup>-1</sup> with MIL-100(Fe) and 0.43 min<sup>-1</sup> of ozonation alone. The TOC removal in MIL-53(Fe)/O<sub>3</sub> system is 4 times higher than that of ozonation alone. MIL-53(Fe) displays acceptable reusability and stability after 5 cycles. Surface LAS of MIL-53(Fe) are the active sites for the ozone decomposition. Moreover, surface-adsorbed hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical and singlet oxygen are confirmed as the reactive oxygen species from ozone decomposition in MIL-53(Fe) suspension. This work offers new platforms for catalytic ozonation and may drive the development of MOFs-based catalytic ozonation for effective water treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
