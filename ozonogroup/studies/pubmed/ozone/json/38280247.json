In this case the digestate originated from a mixture of dairy and animal wastes and a small amount of agricultural wastes. It was processed by the application of several treatments, applied in series, i.e. microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, selective electrodialysis and combined UV/ozonation. The initially applied membrane filtration methods (micro- and ultra-filtration) removed most of the suspended solids and macromolecules with a combined efficiency of more than 80%, while the reverse osmosis (at the end) removed almost all the remaining solutes (85-100%), producing sufficiently clarified water, appropriate for potential reuse. In the selective electrodialysis unit over 95% of ammonium and potassium were recovered from the feed, along with 55% of the phosphates. Of the latter, 75% was retrieved in the form of struvite."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
