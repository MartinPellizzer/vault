The excitation-emission matrices spectra (EEMs) of natural as well as oxidised NOM fractions revealed two well-resolved bands with maxima at Ex/Em of 250-265/422-452 nm and at Ex/Em 300-336/414-446 nm ascribed to humic and fulvic material. The study of emission and synchronous spectra also confirmed the presence of protein-like constituents in all examined NOM fractions. The study of EEMs proved, that oxidation of all NOM fractions with ClO(2) caused mainly the break-up of molecules into smaller fragments and a decrease of the aromaticity. Changes in EEMs after the oxidation of individual NOM fractions with O(3) confirmed the formation of a significant amount of ozonation by-products, i.e. carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones during the oxidation process. In addition, the fluorescence studies confirmed relatively high reactivity of all NOM fractions with ClO(2) as well as with ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Water Treatment Technology, Adam Mickiewicz University, Faculty of Chemistry, ul.
