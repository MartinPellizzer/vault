In the present study, the reaction of tetramethylethene (TME) with ozone was investigated using self-assembled low temperature matrix isolation system. The TME and ozone were co-deposited on a salt plate at 15\u00a0K, and then slowly warmed up the plate. The first transient species primary ozonide (POZ) was detected, indicating that the reaction followed Criegee mechanism. Then POZ began to decompose at 180\u00a0K. However, secondary ozonide (SOZ) was not observed according to Criegee mechanism. Probably, Criegee Intermediate (CI) did not react with inert carbonyl of acetone, but with remaining TME formed tetra-methyl epoxide (EPO)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
