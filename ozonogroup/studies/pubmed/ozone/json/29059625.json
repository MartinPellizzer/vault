However, the association between air pollution exposure, especially particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <= 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and SDB is still unclear. We collected 4312 participants' data from the Taipei Medical University Hospital's Sleep Center and air pollution data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. Associations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <=10\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>), PM<sub>2.5</sub>, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) were investigated by generalized additive models. We found that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 1-year mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> (3.4\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) and NO<sub>2</sub> (2.7\u00a0ppb) was associated with a 4.7% and 3.6% increase in AHI, respectively. We also observed the association of an IQR increase in 1-year mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> with a 2.5% increase in ODI. The similar pattern was found in the association of daily mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure with increased AHI. Moreover, participants showed significant AHI and ODI responses to air pollution levels in spring and winter. We concluded that exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with SDB. Effects of air pollution on AHI and ODI were significant in spring and winter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
