Ozone has strong oxidizing power and has been utilized widely in water and wastewater treatment. In recent years, researches on combined process of ozone-membrane filtration are increasing. This paper does reviews and analysis of these researches. It is noticed that there has been a few of researches on the ozone treatment plus MBR process. Pre-ozonation of feed to MBR and slight ozonation of the mixed liquid in MBR may be used to relieve membrane fouling.Combined processes of ozone-membrane filtration can be divided into three classes in terms of the function of ozone and the system configuration: (1) cleaning the fouled membrane with ozone; (2) separate ozone-membrane filtration process; (3) integrated ozone-membrane filtration process. Although most reports supported that ozonation can control membrane fouling development,there were contrary results. At present, researches on the mechanisms of ozone's effect on membrane fouling control concentrated on the change of organic composition of the filtration influent under ozonation, however, particulate substances, microbial and inorganic substances may also be affected and then play roles in membrane fouling, depending on source water quality and process configuration. Moreover, there have not been common parameters to evaluate the ozone diffusion equipment and efficiency. The authors suggest that further researches should emphasize on integrated ozone-membrane process, and more attention should be paid to the cost-effectiveness of the combined process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China. zhuht03@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Hong-tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Xiang-hua", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Failure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membranes, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}], "NumberOfReferences": "79"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19353897"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
