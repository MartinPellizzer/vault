Antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione levels were measured in rat type II cells that were freshly isolated, cultured for 1 day in serum-supplemented medium, and subsequently grown in serum-free nutrient medium. After measurement of peak bioelectric properties on Day 4 in primary culture, alveolar epithelial monolayers were exposed to ozone at various concentrations and lengths of exposure. Ozone-induced alterations in monolayer bioelectric properties and impairment of cellular organization were used to evaluate oxidant injury. The primary effect of ozone exposure was a dose-dependent increase in monolayer permeability, which resulted from damage to intercellular junctions and/or loss of epithelial integrity. Extensive and persistent permeability increases correlated with focal areas of epithelial degradation. The focal nature of ozone injury to alveolar epithelium in vitro suggests that individual cell susceptibility to oxidant stress may account for the overall decrement in barrier function. However, this sensitivity does not result from overall loss of antioxidant defenses associated with cell culture, as these monolayers (when cultured in serum-free medium) maintained their antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione content at levels found in freshly isolated cells. We conclude that the sensitivity of these monolayers to ozone injury in vitro reflects a disproportionate degree of oxidant stress on cell membranes relative to intracellular antioxidant defenses, i.e., cellular susceptibility to oxidant injury may depend on the ratio of the surface area of the cell to its cytoplasmic volume."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Anatomy, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheek", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buckpitt", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarkington", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NIEHS 00628", "Acronym": "EH", "Agency": "NCEH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophysiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Alveoli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8128496", "10.1006/taap.1994.1049", "S0041008X84710490"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
