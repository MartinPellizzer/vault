However, emerging technologies such as ozonization can be used to reduce the levels of these contaminants. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of using ozone at different period and application times during the soaking step of parboiling process. Samples were analyzed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of mycotoxins, swelling power and solubility, head rice yield, protein solubility, cooking time, texturometric profile, colorimetric profile and defective grains. The results showed tha parboiled rice grains treated with ozone present significant reduction of mycotoxins contamination, regardless of the time and period of application and the mycotoxin evaluated. Regardig to technological properties, the samples treated with ozone in the final 3\u00a0h and for 5\u00a0h of soaking presented higher head rice yield, luminosity and hardness, with decreases in cooking time, percentage of defective grains and soluble protein."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
