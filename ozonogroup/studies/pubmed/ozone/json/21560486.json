Data on the average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone(O(3)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), and particles with aerodynamic diameter < 10 microm (PM(10)) for each month were obtained from the Environmental Protection Department through 71 stations of air quality monitor distributed nationwide. PSI value (pollutants standard index)> 100 was considered poor air quality. Seasonal variations in asthma admissions were compared to the air pollution quality data using Spearman's rank correlation.", "Asthma hospitalization was not related to the number of days when the PSI was > 100 during the 24-months period (r = -0.361; p = 0.083). However, it was significantly associated with seasonal changes in the concentration of each pollutant. The most strongly related air pollutant variable was PM(10) (standardized coefficients 0.384), followed by 0(3) (standardized coefficients 0.255) and SO(2) (standardized coefficients 0.162) concentrations. The association of seasonal changes in asthma hospitalization with these pollutants was greater in pre-school and school age children. Temperature and rainfall in all seasons were not related to asthma hospitalization. None of the pollutants were associated with seasonal variations in admission rate for adolescents.", "Seasonal variations of asthma hospitalization among preschool children are associated with concentration of air pollutants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Asthma and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkuo and Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeh", "ForeName": "Kuo-Wei", "Initials": "KW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chee-Jen", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jing-Long", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "8402034", "ISSNLinking": "0125-877X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7U1EE4V452", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Monoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21560486"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
