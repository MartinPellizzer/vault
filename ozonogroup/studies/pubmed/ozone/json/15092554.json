Cotton (cv SJ-2) was grown in open-top chambers in the field at three levels of soil water and exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CF), nonfiltered air (NF), and NF x 1.25, and NF x 1.5 ambient O3 concentrations in Riverside, CA, from June to October 1986. Ozone reduced carbon fixation an average of 74.6% in optimally watered (OW) plots, 63.4% in suboptimal (SO) plots, but only 19.3% in severely water-stressed (SS) plots. Leaf and stem biomass in OW and SO plots showed similar linear reductions in mass response to increased O3 concentrations, but SS plots showed no response to O3 except at the highest O3 treatment (seasonal 12-h O3 mean of 0.111 ppm 218 microm(-3)). These results showed that moderately water-stressed cotton had similar physiological and growth responses to O3 as well-watered plants, but severely water-stressed cotton showed little response to O3 at ambient O3 concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Temple", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kupper", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lennox", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rohr", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092554", "10.1016/0269-7491(88)90038-3", "0269749188900383"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
