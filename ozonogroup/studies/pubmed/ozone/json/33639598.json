Psychosocial stress could be a potential effect modifier for adverse health effects of air pollution, but research evidence is scarce. A cross-sectional study with 373 elderly subjects was conducted in Beijing during 2018-2019. We collected psychosocial stress information on anxiety, perceived stress and depression, obtained daily environmental data, measured resting BP, blood glucose and lipids in study participants, and analyzed the associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> with cardiovascular health indicators and the modification effect by psychosocial stress. Results showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> was significantly associated with increased systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP) ; and O<sub>3</sub> was significantly associated with elevated DBP, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total triglyceride (TG). In addition, the associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> with TG, and O<sub>3</sub> with SBP and TG were higher in participants with high psychosocial stress, whereas the associations of O<sub>3</sub> with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)\u00a0were higher in participants with low psychosocial stress. For an interquartile range (IQR) (56.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3) increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> at 4-d moving average, TG increased by 21.43% (95% CI: 2.90, 43.29) in high perceived-stress group, and decreased by 20.05% (95% CI:\u00a0-30.31,\u00a0-8.28) in low perceived-stress group (p for interaction\u00a0= 0.04). For an IQR (63.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3) increase in O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0at 2-d moving average, TG increased by 32.01% (95% CI: 7.65, 61.89) in high perceived-stress group, and increased by 7.95% (95% CI:\u00a0-9.80, 29.20) only in low perceived-stress group (p for interaction\u00a0= 0.04). For an IQR (64.0\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3) increase in O<sub>3</sub> at 3-d moving average, HDL-C decreased by 4.55% (95% CI:\u00a0-12.15, 3.72) in high perceived-stress group, and increased by 0.57% (95% CI:\u00a0-6.99, 8.75) in low perceived-stress group (p for interaction=0.002). In conclusion, our results indicated that short-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were associated with significant changes in BP, blood glucose and lipids, and psychosocial stress may increase the susceptibility of the participants to the adverse cardiovascular effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
