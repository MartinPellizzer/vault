Healthy men (n = 10) were evaluated over 3 consecutive days (130 min/day) of chamber exposure to O3 and filtered air (FA); subjects alternated between rest and light treadmill exercise during exposures. For O3, the level was varied at 20-min intervals, i.e., 250, 350, 450, 450, 350, and 250 parts/billion, and concluded with 10 min at 250 parts/billion. ST was quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques, and T-lymphocyte blastogenesis was measured in cell cultures of peripheral blood monocytes by comparing [3H]thymidine incorporation in mitogen-stimulated (concanavalin A) and nonstimulated cells. After the third day of O3 at 20 h postexposure, ST levels were reduced significantly compared with the FA control subjects (down 14%; -0.96 mumol/l). Mitogen-activated T lymphocytes exhibited a 61% increase in blastogenic activity after 3 days of O3 exposure, significant compared with the proliferative activity of activated T lymphocytes collected after FA or before O3. Acute airway function was impaired by O3, e.g., on day 1, the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were decreased 8% (-0.92 liter) and 14% (-0.86 l/s), respectively, from preexposure values, and full recovery was delayed beyond 24 h. Effects of O3 exposure on cellular and biochemical markers increased in magnitude after each exposure and did not parallel the apparent adaptability of bronchial sensitivity to O3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA. mfoster@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foster", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wills-Karp", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tankersley", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paquette", "ForeName": "N C", "Initials": "NC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-03819", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01-HL-31429", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8872648", "10.1152/jappl.1996.81.2.794"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
