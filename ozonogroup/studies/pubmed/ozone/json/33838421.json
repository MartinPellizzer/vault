On one hand, the CeO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-16 mesoporous structured materials presented large surface area and uniform pore distribution, which was conducive to the adsorption of transformation by-products (TBPs) and then, the mass transfer. On the other hand, CeO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-16 could enhance the ozone utilization efficiency and meanwhile facilitate the formation of OH, the main reactive oxygen species. Through the exploration of dissoluble organic matters and the identification of the reaction intermediates, two BPA degradation pathways were proposed. This approach reported here will benefit the design and construction of mesoporous structured materials for catalytic elimination of hazards to remediate the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
