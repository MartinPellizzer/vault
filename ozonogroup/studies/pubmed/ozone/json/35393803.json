The constituent features of VOCs, the preferred VOCs species, and VOCs characteristic pollutant ratios were analyzed. The results showed that alkanes were the most important component in the volume fraction of VOCs, accounting for 62.40%. C2-C6 alkanes, benzene series, ethylene, and acetylene were the key species of VOCs. Olefins and aromatics were the main contribution components of OFP, with contribution rates of 41.35% and 37.50%, respectively. Aromatics were the main contributors to SOA, with a contribution rate of more than 90%. Low carbon alkanes, low carbon olefins, and benzene series were the key contributing species of OFP. Controlling toluene, m/<i>p</i>-xylene, and <i>o</i>-xylene is the key to the coordinated control of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. VOCs in the atmosphere of the sampling point were not only affected by motor vehicle exhaust but were also significantly affected by industrial emissions, such as solvents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ren-Chang", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Jia-Jia", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Hangzhou 310007, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Kai-Er", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J64922108F", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35393803", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202108082"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
