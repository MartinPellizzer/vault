In this temperature regime, no typical low-temperature combustion (LTC) reactions have been observed for MC when oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is used as the oxidizer. Upon ozone addition, significant oxidation of methyl crotonate is found. On the basis of experimentally observed energy-dependent mass peaks in combination with temperature-dependent mole fraction profiles and photoionization efficiency curves, we provide new insights into the methyl crotonate ozonolysis reaction network. The observed MC + O<sub>3</sub> products, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, are found to be related to the keto-hydroperoxides resulting from the isomerization of the primary ozonide. Evidence is also provided that molecular growth mainly results from cycloaddition reactions of the Criegee intermediate into aldehydes and alkenes as well as addition reactions of the Criegee intermediates to the double bond of methyl crotonate and sequential decomposition into ketones. Furthermore, species that contribute in large amounts to the low-temperature oxidation of methyl crotonate, like H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OOH, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, and HC(O)OH, are identified, and their mole fractions are reported. Additionally, preliminary modeling is performed which qualitatively captures the observed NTC behavior and reveals future research opportunities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1375-0797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California 94551, United States."}], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), 38116 Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Moshammer", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "37"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32893634", "10.1021/acs.jpca.0c05684"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
