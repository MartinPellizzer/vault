Although laboratory measurement of <i>k</i><sub>OH</sub>' has been achieved 20 years ago, the instruments required are often costly and complex. Long-term atmospheric observations remain challenging and elusive. In this work, a novel instrument combining laser-flash photolysis with a mid-infrared Faraday rotation spectrometer (LFP-FRS) has been developed for the measurement of <i>k</i><sub>OH</sub>' and for studying gas phase free radical kinetics. The reactor is composed of a Herriott-type optical multipass cell, and OH radicals were generated by flash photolysis of ozone with a 266 nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The decay of the OH signal was directly measured with a time-resolved FRS spectrometer at 2.8 \u03bcm. The overlapping path length between the pump beam and probe beam was 25 m. High performance was achieved by subtracting the signals before and after flash photolysis to eliminate interferences caused by H<sub>2</sub>O absorption and background drift. The optimum precisions (1\u03c3) of OH concentration and <i>k</i><sub>OH</sub>' measurement were 4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup> and 0.09 s<sup>-1</sup> over data acquisition times of 56 and 112 s, respectively. The performance of the system was evaluated by the reaction of OH with CO and NO. The measured rate coefficients (<i>k</i><sub>OH+CO</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>OH+NO</sub>) were in good agreement with values reported in the literature. The developed LFP-FRS provides a new, high precision, and highly selective tool for atmospheric chemistry research of OH radicals and other transient paramagnetic free radicals such as HO<sub>2</sub> radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Physico-Chemistry, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Nana", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Physico-Chemistry, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1700-8992"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Physico-Chemistry, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Weixiong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Physico-Chemistry, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunhui", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Physico-Chemistry, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Nana", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Atmospheric Physico-Chemistry, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Weijun", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physicochimie de l'Atmosph\u00e8re, Universit\u00e9 du Littoral C\u00f4te d'Opale, 59140 Dunkerque, France."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Weidong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Lille, CNRS, UMR 8522-PC2A-Physicochimie des Processus de Combustion et de l'Atmosph\u00e8re, F-59000 Lille, France."}], "LastName": "Fittschen", "ForeName": "Christa", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31984730", "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05117"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
