By applying a recently developed non-target workflow, 178 carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds were detected during bench-scale ozonation of two lake waters and three secondary wastewater effluent samples and full-scale ozonation of secondary treated wastewater effluent. An overlapping subset of carbonyl compounds (20%) was detected in all water types. Moreover, wastewater effluents showed a significantly higher fraction of N-containing carbonyl compounds (30%) compared to lake water (17%). All carbonyl compounds can be classified in 5 main formation trends as a function of increasing specific ozone doses. Formation trends upon ozonation and comparison of results in presence and absence of the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH radical scavenger DMSO in combination with kinetic and mechanistic information allowed to elucidate potential carbonyl structures. A link between the detected carbonyl compounds and their precursors was established by ozonating six model compounds (phenol, 4-ethylphenol, 4-methoxyphenol, sorbic acid, 3-buten-2-ol and acetylacetone). About one third of the detected carbonous carbonyl compounds detected in real waters was also detected by ozonating model compounds. Evaluation of the non-target analysis data revealed the identity of 15 carbonyl compounds, including hydroxylated aldehydes and ketones (e.g. hydroxyacetone, confidence level (CL)\u00a0=\u00a01), unsaturated dicarbonyls (e.g. acrolein, CL\u00a0=\u00a01; 2-butene-1,4-dial, CL\u00a0=\u00a01; 4-oxobut-2-enoic acid, CL\u00a0=\u00a02) and also a nitrogen-containing carbonyl compound (2-oxo-propanamide, CL =1). Overall, this study shows the formation of versatile carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds upon ozonation involving ozone and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH reactions. Carbonyl compounds with unknown toxicity might be formed, and it could be demonstrated that acrolein, malondialdehyde, methyl glyoxal, 2-butene-1,4-dial and 4-oxo-pentenal are degraded during biological post-treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
