Profiling of VHCs is of great significance but replete with challenges due to the species' richness and diversity. In this study, we developed a novel method employing water removal mode combined with thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) for on-line measurement of VHCs at the ultratrace level. By removing water with Nafion dryer tandem cold trap device, VHCs could achieve better separation and identification, and detection precision of VHCs lower than 10%. The proposed method exhibited limits of detection for VHCs ranging from 0.1 to 6.2\u00a0pptv. Benefiting from the improved trapping efficiency due to water removal, we successfully quantified 34\u00a0VHCs at the Shangdianzi background station and achieved a comprehensive assessment of VHCs in ambient air."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
