The primary outcomes included the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain intensity and Harris Hip Score (HHS) for hip function. The secondary outcomes included bone marrow edema examination, and conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA).", "Ozone therapy effectively improves VAS for pain intensity and HHS during the follow-up period compared to the control group. Ozone therapy showed a significant resolution of bone marrow edema of the femoral head compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Thirteen of the 49 hips (26.53%) in the control group underwent THA, whereas only 6 hips (10.34%) in the ozone therapy group required THA during a 30-month follow-up (P = 0.041).
