Recent industrialization has led to an increasing air pollutant problem which is exacerbated by the topography and prevailing climate of the region. To date, interest has remained firmly focused on the levels of traditional air pollutants (sulphur dioxide [SO2], oxides of nitrogen [NOx], smoke and suspended particulate matter [SPM]), with little attention paid to photochemical oxidants such as ozone (O3). This paper reports the first assessment of ambient O3 levels in southwest China. Measurements were made in and around Chongqing using a combination of UV-absorption (at a site located in the northern sector of the city) and passive samplers (at 20 sites located in and around the city) between 1993 and 1996. The 7-h daily mean O3 concentrations ranged between 2 and 16 ppb (x10(9)) during the winter months, increasing to 18-41 ppb during the summer (June-August), when peak hourly mean O3 concentrations of 93 ppb were attained. Ozone exposures across the region commonly approached (or exceeded) UN-ECE and WHO short-term guidelines for the protection of crops. In addition, controlled chamber studies, in which 11 cultivars of Chinese crops commonly grown in the Chongqing region were screened for relative O3 sensitivity, indicated the potential for subtle effects on the growth of a number of crop plants, if ambient O3 levels continue to rise in the region. Employing ozone exposures somewhat higher than those experienced in the field, several cultivars of commonly grown Chinese cereal, vegetable and salad crops were found to be sensitive to O3 in terms of growth, but this was not always associated with the appearance of visible symptoms of injury and, in contrast to what was generally expected, only three species showed significant O3-induced reductions in root:shoot partitioning. There is a clear and urgent need for a comprehensive study of ambient air quality and its impact on crops and natural vegetation in this, as in other, rapidly developing regions of China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AEA Technology, Culham, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 3DB, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stevenson", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barrowcliffe", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15093294", "10.1016/s0269-7491(98)00017-7", "S0269749198000177"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
