They include ozone (O3), particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead. All except lead may interfere with oxygen delivery, and so may be of special concern to asthmatics. In controlled experiments, SO2 causes acute asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction, preventable by beta-agonist medications. Ozone causes acute irritant symptoms, restrictive lung dysfunction, increased bronchial reactivity, and lower-airway inflammation in healthy people and asthmatics. Exposures to O3, and possibly to other pollutants, appear to exacerbate bronchoconstrictive or inflammatory responses to inhaled aeroallergens (bioaerosols); this may represent an important health risk to asthmatics. Exposure levels known to evoke acute responses to O3 or SO2 are uncommon in community air pollution; however, some asthmatics might be susceptible to lesser, more common exposures. Evidence concerning NO2 is equivocal, but it may have O3-like effects in some asthmatics. Epidemiology has often associated particulate pollution with asthma exacerbations and other cardiorespiratory illnesses, even in cities with relatively mild air pollution. Current laboratory research cannot fully explain this association. Advances in emission controls should further reduce ambient pollution levels, but probably will not reduce asthma morbidity. Better asthma management, with improved anti-inflammatory medications, more careful monitoring by patients and health care providers, and reasonable efforts to reduce pollutant and aeroallergen exposures, offers the best hope to reduce asthma morbidity in the new century."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, Downey, CA 90242, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linn", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Curr Opin Pulm Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9503765", "ISSNLinking": "1070-5287"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "NumberOfReferences": "44"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10813245", "10.1097/00063198-199901000-00004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
