This is obviously a bad approximation of the surface of the human body. In order to evaluate the importance of using a realistic geometric representation of the surface of the human body we here present calculations of the flux of carcinogenically effective radiation falling on three different bodies: a vertically standing cylinder, a sphere and a horizontally oriented surface. The exposure to carcinogenic radiation depends strongly on the surface geometry. However we find that the radiation amplification factors are almost independent of the surface geometry chosen. The biological amplification factors for the three geometrical representations are also similar to within 20%. The total amplification factor for the increase in the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer related to ozone depletion is about 17% larger when a cylindrical representation is used compared to when a plane horizontal surface is considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics, University of Oslo, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dahlback", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2287633", "10.1111/j.1751-1097.1990.tb01820.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
