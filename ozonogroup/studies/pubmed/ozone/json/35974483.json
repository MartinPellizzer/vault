However, flower diameter, nectary volume and nectar amount per flower (but not nectar concentration) were significantly increased by supplemental UV-B radiation. In addition UV-B treated plants showed higher reproductive success (i.e. lower abortion rates and higher fruit to flower ratio) and a trend to higher pollination success (i.e. increased number of seeds per fruit). As a result, the seed yield was increased. Seed mass, seed germination and early seedling growth were not affected by UV-B treatment of mother plants. \u2022\u2002 It is suggested that the UV-B induced changes in flower attributes might have affected pollinators' behaviour in a way that improved the fitness of M. maritima."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Plant Biology, Department of Biology, University of Patras, GR-265 00 Patras, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petropoulou", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Plant Biology, Department of Biology, University of Patras, GR-265 00 Patras, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Georgiou", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Plant Biology, Department of Biology, University of Patras, GR-265 00 Patras, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Psaras", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Plant Biology, Department of Biology, University of Patras, GR-265 00 Patras, Greece."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manetas", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ballar\u00e9 CL, Barnes PW, Flint SD. 1995.
