The experimental Arrhenius expression obtained for the reaction of the OH radical with AAL is (1.68 +/- 0.89) x 10(-12) x exp(1100/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), for T = 282-315 K; the Arrhenius expression for the reaction of OH radical with AIC is (1.94 +/- 1.04) x 10(-14) x exp(2207/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), for T = 282-317 K, where the indicated errors are one least-squares standard deviation. All OH radical reaction rate constants have been measured relative to k(OH + alpha-pinene) and k(OH + 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of OH radical with allyl alcohol-d(6) isotopomer (AAL-d(6)) has been measured at T = 298 K, and the value is 5.10 x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The kinetic isotope effect is small, with k(AAL)/k(AAL-d(6)) = 1.32. Rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of NO(3) radical with AAL [relative to k(NO(3) +methacrolein)] and O(3) [relative to k(O(3) + beta-pinene)] have been measured, and the values are 7.7 x 10(-15) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at T = 298 K and 1.6 x 10(-17) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at T = 296 K, respectively. Rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of NO(3) radical and O(3) with AIC have been measured, and the values are 9.4 x 10(-16) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at T = 299 K and 5.54 x 10(-18) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at T = 299 K, respectively. Multireference ab initio calculations at the MRMP2/6-311G(d,p) level have been carried out for reactions of OH radical with AAL and AIC. Results indicate that prereactive hydrogen bonded complexes form in the entrance channels for these reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Midwest Research Institute, 425 Volker Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri 64110, USA. james.kenneth.parker@arl.army.mil"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parker", "ForeName": "James K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Espada-Jallad", "ForeName": "Cyntia", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19725585", "10.1021/jp9055939"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
