Our test samples were (1) wet-spun fibers of smalldiameter (1-2 nm) singlewall (SW)-CNTs and (2) dry-spun fibers containing large-diameter (20 nm) multiwall (MW)-CNTs. Our results indicate that SW-CNTFs undergo oxygenation to a higher extent than MW-CNTFs due to the higher reactivity of SW-CNTs with a larger curvature strain. Oxygenation resulting from O\u2083 exposure was evidenced as increase in surface O atomic% (at% by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS) and as reductions in G/D (by Raman spectroscopy) as well as electrical conductivities due to changes in nanotube graphitic structure. By XPS, we identified the emergence of various types of O-functionalities on the fiber surfaces. After long duration O3 exposure (>300 s for SW-CNTFs and >600 s for MW-CNTFs), both <i>sp</i>\u00b2 C\u2550O (carbonyl) and <i>sp</i>\u00b3 C-O moieties (ether/hydroxy) were observed on fiber surfaces. Whereas, only <i>sp</i>\u00b3 C-O (ether/hydroxy) components were observed after shorter exposure times. O\u2083 treatment led to only changes in surface chemistry, while the fiber morphology, microstructure and dimensions remained unaltered. We believe the surface chemistry controllability demonstrated here on commercial fibers spun by different methods containing nanotubes of different structures is of significance in aiding the practical application development of CNTFs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNT-Application Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 3058565, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sundaram", "ForeName": "Rajyashree M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNT-Application Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 3058565, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "Takeo", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNT-Application Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 3058565, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kokubo", "ForeName": "Ken", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNT-Application Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 3058565, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hata", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CNT-Application Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Central 5, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 3058565, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sekiguchi", "ForeName": "Atsuko", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotubes, Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoelectron Spectroscopy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34229816", "10.1166/jnn.2021.19536"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
