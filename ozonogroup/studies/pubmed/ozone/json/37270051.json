In this study, to mitigate BA-driven autotoxicity, the effects of O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation treatment (O<sub>3</sub> concentration: 1, 2, 4, 8\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration: 4, 8\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) on waste nutrient solution (WNS) were investigated in terms of BA degradation, the rate of germination inhibition (GI), and the rate of root growth inhibition (RI). In the case of O<sub>3</sub> treatment, the BA degradation rate improved up to 14.1% as the O<sub>3</sub> concentration increased, while alleviation of GI was insignificant (94.6-100%), confirming that a single O<sub>3</sub> treatment was unsuitable for mitigating autotoxicity. On the other hand, O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment increased BA degradation by up to 24.8%, thereby significantly reducing GI (up to 7.69%) and RI (up to 0.88%). Both the highest BA mineralization rate and phytotoxicity mitigation was observed at BA<sub>125</sub> (4-4) (BA mineralization: 16.7%, GI: 12.82%, RI: 11.69%) and BA<sub>125</sub> (1-8) (BA mineralization: 17.7%, GI: 7.69%, RI: 0.88%) at each H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. In addition, the operating costs were evaluated by a chemical and electricity cost analysis at the different treatments. As a result, the operating costs of BA<sub>125</sub> (4-4) and BA<sub>125</sub> (1-8) were calculated to be 0.40 and 0.42 $ L<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup> of mineralized BA, respectively. After consideration of the mineralization rate, autotoxicity mitigation, and operating cost, BA<sub>125</sub> (1-8) was suggested for the optimal treatment condition and our findings would contribute to the alleviation of BA-driven autotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
