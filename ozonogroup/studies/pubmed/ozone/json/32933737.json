As the key precursors of ozone generation, it is necessary to control the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) pollution. To have a better understanding of the pollution status and source contribution, the concentrations of 117 ambient VOCs were analyzed from April to August 2018 in an urban site in Shijiazhuang. Results showed that the monthly average concentration of total VOCs was 66.27 ppbv, in which, the oxygenated VOCs (37.89%), alkanes (33.89%), and halogenated hydrocarbons (13.31%) were the main composite on. Eight major sources were identified using Positive Matrix Factorization modeling with an accurate VOCs emission inventory as inter-complementary methods revealed that the petrochemical industry (26.24%), other industrial sources (15.19%), and traffic source (12.24%) were the major sources for ambient VOCs in Shijiazhuang. The spatial distributions of major industrial activities emissions were identified by using geographic information statistics system, which illustrated the VOCs was mainly from the north and southeast of Shijiazhuang. The inverse trajectory analysis using Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) clearly demonstrated the features of pollutant transport to Shijiazhuang. These findings can provide references for local governments regarding control strategies to reduce VOCs emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
