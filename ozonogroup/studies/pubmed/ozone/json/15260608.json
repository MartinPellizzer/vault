Progress on understanding the anomalous isotope effects in ozone is reviewed. Then, calculations are performed for the simpler reaction xNe+yNe+H<-->xNeyNe+H, where x and y label either identical or different isotopes. The atomic masses in the model are chosen so that symmetry is the only difference between the systems. Starting from a single potential energy surface, the properties of the bound, quasibound, and continuum states of the neon dimer are calculated. Then, the vibration rotation infinite order sudden approximation is used to calculate cross sections for all possible inelastic and dissociative processes. A rate constant matrix that exactly satisfies detailed balance is constructed. It allows recombination to occur both via direct three-body collisions and via tunneling into the quasibound states of the energy transfer mechanism. The eigenvalue rate coefficients are determined. Significant isotope effects are clearly found, and their behavior depends on the pressure, temperature, and mechanism of the reaction. Both spin statistics and symmetry breaking produce isotope effects. Under most conditions the breaking of symmetry enhances the rates, but a wide spectrum of effects is observed; they range from isotope effects with a normal mass dependence to huge, mass-independent isotope effects to cancellation and even to reversal of the isotope effects. This is the first calculation of symmetry-induced isotope effects in recombination rates from first principles. The relevance of the present effects to ozone recombination is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Theoretical Division (T-12, MS B268), Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pack", "ForeName": "Russell T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "Robert B", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15260608", "10.1063/1.1758697"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
