NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations were continuously measured over a three-month period, as well as real-time particle size distribution. A rural site located at Cape Gris-Nez, 20km from Calais, was considered to deduce intrinsic contribution of ship emissions at the harbor city. The average concentrations of the studied species as well as the pattern of the conditional bivariate probability function at the two sites evidenced that in-port shipping, especially during the maneuvering operations, has an important influence on the NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The impact of shipping in the harbor of Calais on average concentrations was estimated to 51% for SO<sub>2</sub>, 35% for NO, 15% for NO<sub>2</sub> and 2% for PM<sub>10</sub> in the studied period. Concentration peaks of SO<sub>2</sub> and NOx associated with an O<sub>3</sub> depletion appeared synchronized with departures and arrivals of ferries. For winds blowing from the harbor, when compared to the background level, the number of particles appeared 10 times higher, with the highest differences in the 30-67nm and the 109-167nm size ranges. The average impact of in-port ships on PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations was estimated to +28.9\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and concerned mainly the PM<sub>1</sub> size fraction (40%). Punctually, PM<sub>10</sub> can potentially reach a concentration value close to 100\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
