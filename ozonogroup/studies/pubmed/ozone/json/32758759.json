As the main grain producing area in China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is facing serious O<sub>3</sub> pollution. This study analyzed the hourly ground-level O<sub>3</sub> observation data of 158 stations from 2014 to 2019 in YRD, and grain production data of 193 districts and counties. The exposure-response relationships based on AOT40 (accumulated hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration above 40\u00a0ppb) was used to estimate the yield loss and economic loss of two food crops (winter wheat and rice). This study used spatial interpolation and calculated the specific data values of each district and county in order to improve the assessment reliability. For years 2014-2019, averaged O<sub>3</sub> concentration during the 75\u00a0days growing period of rice and wheat were 33.1-50.6\u00a0ppb and 32.2-48.0\u00a0ppb, AOT40 value were 5.2-12.0\u00a0ppm\u00a0h and 4.6-9.4\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, and the averaged relative yield losses were 4.9%-11.4% and 9.4%-19.3%, respectively. The trend of O<sub>3</sub> in the YRD in a six-year period peaked in 2016 and 2017 for rice and winter wheat, respectively. During 2014-2017, the average estimated yield loss of rice was 2445 Mt. accounting for about 9.1% of the actual production, and the average estimated economic loss was about 1037 million USD; for winter wheat, it was 2025 Mt, 20.4% and 736 million USD, respectively. These results urge governments to provide effective policies and measures to control O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
