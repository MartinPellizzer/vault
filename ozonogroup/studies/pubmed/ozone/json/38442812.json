Given the existing limitations of satellite data products, especially the lack of ground-level ozone characterization, and the discontinuity of ground observations, there is a pressing need for high-precision models to simulate ground-level ozone to assess surface ozone pollution. In this study, we have compared several widely utilized ensemble learning and deep learning methods for ground-level ozone simulation. Furthermore, we have thoroughly contrasted the temporal and spatial generalization performances of the ensemble learning and deep learning models. The 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3-D CNN) model has emerged as the optimal choice for evaluating the daily maximum 8-h average ozone in Yunnan Province. The model has good performance: a spatial resolution of 0.05\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.05\u00b0 and strong predictive power, as indicated by a Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.83 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.54\u00a0\u03bcg/m\u00b3 in sample-based 5-fold cross-validation (CV). In the final stage of our study, we applied the 3-D CNN model to generate a comprehensive daily maximum 8-h average ozone dataset for Yunnan Province for the year 2021. This application has furnished us with a crucial high-resolution and highly accurate dataset for further in-depth studies on the issue of ozone pollution in Yunnan Province."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
