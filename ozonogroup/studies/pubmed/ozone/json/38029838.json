However, it has not been reported in atopic dermatitis (AD). We used Arraystar m<sup>6</sup>A-mRNA epitranscriptomic microarray to screen for differentially expressed genes and their m<sup>6</sup>A levels and m<sup>6</sup>A-related enzymes in patients with AD. We confirmed that the m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methyltransferase WTAP and 2 candidate differentially expressed genes (S100A9 and SERPINB3) were significantly upregulated in keratinocytes in public data and epidermal lesions of patients with AD. In\u00a0vitro cell experiments confirmed that WTAP influenced the expression of the 2 candidate differentially expressed genes and promoted primary human epidermal keratinocyte proliferation while inhibiting human epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we showed that WTAP, S100A9, and SERPINB3 expression correlated with AD severity. Our findings revealed that WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification promoted the expression of S100A9 and SERPINB3 to aggravate human epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and dysdifferentiation contributing to the pathophysiological development of AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
