During N<sub>2</sub>O production, soil microorganisms play important driving and regulating roles. A few recent studies have revealed the potential effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a widely distributed soil fungi, on controlling N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, how AMF regulate N<sub>2</sub>O production from soils remains poorly understood. To address the knowledge gap, we manipulated two independent soil environments, which were either allowed (AM) or prevented (NM) access by AMF hyphae in a microcosm experiment (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Soil physicochemical properties, N<sub>2</sub>O flux, the diversity of bacterial communities, and the abundance of key genes responsible for N<sub>2</sub>O production were assessed in both treatments over three months. Results showed that the presence of AMF significantly decreased N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural soils in the 1st month, and the abundance of key genes responsible for denitrification (nirK and nosZ) significantly decreased in AM treatments, indicating that the regulation of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions is transmitted by AMF-induced changes in the denitrification process. A structural equation model further revealed that AMF indirectly influenced N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by altering the abundance of N metabolism-related genes, rather than by altering soil chemical properties or the diversity of bacterial communities. Thus, we proposed a possible mechanism by which AMF can regulate denitrification activities and therefore N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
