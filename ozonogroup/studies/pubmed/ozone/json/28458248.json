Cu<sub>x</sub>O-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (Cu<sub>x</sub>FeO NPs, both Cu(I) and Cu(II) were contained, about 70\u00a0nm) were creatively synthesized using Fe(0) as the precursor and subsequently employed as the ozonation catalyst for dimethyl phthalate (DMP) degradation. Results showed that DMP degradation by O<sub>3</sub>/Cu<sub>x</sub>FeO was significantly faster than those ozonation catalyzed by CuO, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or mixture of CuO and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (1:1\u00a0M ratio), which was ascribed to the unique Cu<sub>x</sub>FeO NPs that composed of abundant structural Cu(I) (\u2261Cu(I)). It was among the first revealing the synergistic effect between \u2261Cu(I) and surface lattice oxygen (O<sup>2-</sup>) in HO\u00b7 generation, resulting in rapid DMP degradation kinetics and high mineralization efficiency. Besides the generation of \u2261Cu(I), galvanic corrosion between Fe(0) and Cu(II) also generated structural Fe(II), which could reduce the \u2261Cu(II) back to \u2261Cu(I), thus compensating the electron loss of \u2261Cu(I) and finally obtaining a high-efficiency cycling between \u2261Cu(II) and \u2261Cu(I). The DMP degradation pathway was introduced based on the intermediates detected. By regulating the (re)-generation of low-valent metal (\u2261Cu(I)), this study provides an innovative strategy to significantly promote the generation of HO\u00b7 in catalytic ozonation, which might be promising for advanced wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
