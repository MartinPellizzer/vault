On this flight ozone concentration at altitudes between 20 and 37 km were determined with vertical resolution of approximately 0.5 km. In addition, horizontally resolved ozone measurements with 0.15-km resolution were obtained over a 2-km range. The temporal variation of the hydroxyl radical concentration was measured in the 34-37-km altitude region, ranging from 40 parts/trillion shortly after noon to approximately 5 parts/trillion 2 h after sunset. Improvements in the system are proposed to increase the sensitivity of the instrument below the parts/trillion level, permitting hydroxyl determinations in the 20-30-km altitude range."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heaps", "ForeName": "W S", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McGee", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hudson", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caudill", "ForeName": "L O", "Initials": "LO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20396015", "10.1364/AO.21.002265", "25898"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
