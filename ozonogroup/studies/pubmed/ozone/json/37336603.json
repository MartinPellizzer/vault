Among various methods, groun-based monitoring of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations is highly reliable for research analysis. To obtain information on the spatial characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, it is necessary that the ground monitoring sites be constructed in sufficient density. In recent years, many researchers have used machine learning models to estimate surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, which cannot fully provide the spatial and temporal information contained in a sample dataset. To solve this problem, the current study utilized a deep learning model called the Residual connection Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (R-ConvLSTM) to estimate daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> over Jiangsu province, China during 2020. In this research, the R-ConvLSTM model not only provides the spatiotemporal information of MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>, but also involves residual connection to avoid the problem of gradient explosion and gradient disappearance with the deepening of network layers. We utilized the TROPOMI total O<sub>3</sub> column retrieved from Sentinel-5 Precursor, ERA5 reanalysis meteorological data, and other supplementary data to build a pre-trained dataset. The R-ConvLSTM model achieved an overall sample-base cross-validation (CV) R<sup>2</sup> of 0.955 with root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.372\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>. Model estimation also showed a city-based CV R<sup>2</sup> of 0.896 with RMSE of 14.029\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, the highest MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> in spring being 122.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.60\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> and the lowest in winter being 69.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.48\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
