O<sub>3</sub> is a secondary pollutant whose concentrations are determined inter alia by emissions of precursors such as oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and thus future health burdens depend on policies relating to climate and air quality. While emission controls are expected to reduce levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> and their associated mortality burdens, for secondary pollutants like O<sub>3</sub> the picture is less clear. Detailed assessments are necessary to provide quantitative estimates of future impacts to support decision-makers. We simulate future O<sub>3</sub> across the UK using a high spatial resolution atmospheric chemistry model with current UK and European policy projections for 2030, 2040 and 2050, and use UK regional population-weighting and latest recommendations on health impact assessment to quantify respiratory emergency hospital admissions associated with short-term effects of O<sub>3</sub>. We estimate 60,488 admissions in 2018, increasing by 4.2%, 4.5% and 4.6% by 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively (assuming a fixed population). Including future population growth, estimated emergency respiratory hospital admissions are 8.3%, 10.3% and 11.7% higher by 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively. Increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in future are driven by reduced nitric oxide (NO) in urban areas due to reduced emissions, with increases in O<sub>3</sub> mainly occurring in areas with lowest O<sub>3</sub> concentrations currently. Meteorology influences episodes of O<sub>3</sub> on a day-to-day basis, although a sensitivity study indicates that annual totals of hospital admissions are only slightly impacted by meteorological year. While reducing emissions results in overall benefits to population health (through reduced mortality due to long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>), due to the complex chemistry, as NO emissions reduce there are associated local increases in O<sub>3</sub> close to population centres that may increase harms to health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
