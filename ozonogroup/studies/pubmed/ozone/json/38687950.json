However, the effect of interlayer anions on ozone removal remains ambiguous. Here, a series of NiFe-LDH with different interlayer anions (F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) were prepared to investigate the effect of the interlayer anion on ozone removal for the first time. It was found that the interlayer anions are a key factor affecting the water resistance of the NiFe-LDH catalyst under moist conditions. NiFe-LDH-CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> exhibited the best water resistance, which was much better than that of NiFe-LDH containing other interlayer anions. The in situ DIRFTS demonstrates that the carbonates in the interlayer of NiFe-LDH-CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> will undergo coordination changes through the interaction with water molecules under moist conditions, exposing new metal sites. As a result, the newly exposed metal sites could activate water molecules into hydroxyl groups that act as active sites for catalyzing ozone decomposition. This work provides a new insight into the interlayer anions of LDH, which is important for the design and development of LDH catalysts with excellent ozone removal properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4574-2967"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhisheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiaotong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-0669"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jinzhu", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8476-8217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "50"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38687950", "10.1021/acs.est.4c02276"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
