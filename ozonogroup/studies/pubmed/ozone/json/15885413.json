Acid Black 22 as well as synthesized C.I. Acid Black 22 wastewater by means of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as UV/H2O2, O3 and pre-ozonation coupled with UV/H2O2 processes, were evaluated in this study. It was observed that the UV/H2O2 process took longer retention time than ozonation for color removal of dye bath effluent. Reversely, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal showed different phenomena that ozonation and UV/H2O2 process obtained 33 and 90% of removal efficiency for 160 min of retention time, respectively. Additionally, laboratory synthesized dye wastewater was substantially more efficient in the decolorization process than dye bath effluent. Therefore, in this work, pre-ozonation coupled with UV/H2O2 process was employed to enhance the reduction of both color and TOC in dye bath effluent at the same time. At the same time, the retention time demand was reduced to less than 115 min for 90% removal of TOC and color by this combined process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Hungkuang University, No. 34 Chung-Chie Road, Shalu, Taichung County, Taiwan 433, ROC. hyshu@sunrise.hk.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Hung-Yee", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Ming-Chin", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "direct black 22"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cotton Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Textile Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15885413", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2005.01.020", "S0304-3894(05)00053-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
