The composting process involves an interaction between the organic waste, microorganisms, moisture and oxygen. The molasses-based biomethanated distillery wastewater is presently effectively utilized with sugarcane pressmud through the composting process. The aim of present work was to evaluate the effect of ozone pretreatment on the rate of composting process and the quality of compost obtained. The GC-MS & FTIR analysis of ozone pretreated wastewater indicated the degradation and/or transformation of the organic compounds to simpler compounds present in the wastewater. Composting was performed by mixing fixed weight ratios of pressmud and different ratios of ozone pretreated wastewater (1:3, 1:4 and 1:5). The composting process was found to occur faster in the ozone pretreated wastewater for all the ratios as compared to the untreated wastewater. The final compost characteristics were found to be optimum for the 1:3 and 1:4 ratios of pressmud and wastewater. The bio-oxidative phase duration of composting has been reduced for the ozone pretreated wastewater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
