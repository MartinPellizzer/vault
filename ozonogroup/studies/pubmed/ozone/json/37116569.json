Developing low-cost and efficient catalysts is a promising alternative for ozone decomposition. This work presents a creative strategy that using \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-supported Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles for constructing interfacial oxygen vacancies (Vo) to remove ozone. The efficiency of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was superior to that of pure \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> by nearly two times for 200-ppm ozone removal after 6-h reaction at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, which is ascribed to the highly active interfacial Vo. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy suggest that the Fe<sup>3+</sup>-Vo-Co<sup>2+</sup> was formed when Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was loaded in \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the desorption and electron transfer ability of intermediate peroxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>) on Fe<sup>3+</sup>-Vo-Co<sup>2+</sup> are higher than the Vo from other regions. In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy also demonstrate the higher conversion rate of O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> on Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Base on the intermediates detected, we propose a recycle mechanism of interfacial Vo for ozone removal: O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> is quickly converted to O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and transformed into O<sub>2</sub> on interfacial Vo. Moreover, O<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), H<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveal that the oxygen mobility, reducibility, and conductivity of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/\u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are greatly superior to those of \u03b1-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is contributed to the conversion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Consequently, our proposed strategy effectively enhances the activity and stability of the bimetallic transition oxides for ozone decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
