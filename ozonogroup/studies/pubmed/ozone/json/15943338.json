For use of high-spectral-resolution gas absorption cross sections from the literature in trace gas retrieval algorithms, accurate determination of the instrument's spectral slit function is essential. Ground-based measurements of the zenith sky provide a geophysical determination of atmospheric trace gas abundances. When compared with other measurements, they can be used to verify the performance of the OMI flight instrument. We show that the approach of using published high-resolution absolute absorption cross sections convolved with accurately calibrated spectral slit functions for OMI compares well with in situ gas absorption cell measurements made with the flight instrument and that use of these convolved cross sections works well for reduction of zenith sky data taken with the OMI flight instrument for ozone and nitrogen dioxide that are retrieved from measured spectra of the zenith sky with the differential optical absorption spectroscopy technique, the same method to be used for the generation of in-flight data products. Finally, it is demonstrated that the spectral stability and signal-to-noise ratio performance of the OMI flight instrument, as determined from preflight component and full instrument tests, are sufficient to meet OMI mission objectives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, P.O.
