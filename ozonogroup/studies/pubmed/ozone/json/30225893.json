This study is focused on exploring the potential relationship between short-term air pollution exposure and occurrence of AF.", "A case-crossover design was used to investigate the effect of pollutants on AF occurrence among 100 patients from 2013 to 2014. The air pollutants included ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> ), particulate matter less than 10 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub> ), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub> ), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ). Participants with cardiac implantable electronic devices implanted were followed-up to December 31, 2014.", "A 10 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> was associated with 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-6.2) and 2.7% (95% CI: 0.6-4.8) increase in the risk of AF occurrence, respectively. No statistically significant association was noted with SO<sub>2</sub> , NO<sub>2</sub> , CO, and O<sub>3</sub> .", "Short-term exposure to particular matter, both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> , is associated with an increased risk of AF.
