The animals were divided into four groups, which were treated with sesame oil (vehicle), framycetin (standard), or two doses of ozonated sesame oil (peroxide values 500 and 700 mEq/1000 g, respectively). The formulations were topically applied on the excision wounds once daily for 11 consecutive days and the animals were euthanized on the 12(th) day. Wound healing was assessed by measuring the wound contracture, tensile strength, collagen content and superoxide dismutase activity of skin of the excised wound area. On the terminal day, areas of the wounds of the group receiving high dose ozonated oil were significantly smaller than those of the group treated with vehicle. Ozonated oil treated wounds had significantly higher tensile strength, collagen content and superoxide dismutase activity than that of the vehicle treated wounds. Histopathological analysis of skin of the excised wound area treated with ozonated oil revealed better healing activity vis-\u00e0-vis vehicle-treated wounds. Thus, it can be concluded that ozonated oil can be of potential therapeutic use for healing wounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Bombay College of Pharmacy, Kalina, Mumbai-400 098, India."}], "LastName": "Pai", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Bombay College of Pharmacy, Kalina, Mumbai-400 098, India."}], "LastName": "Gagangras", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Bombay College of Pharmacy, Kalina, Mumbai-400 098, India."}], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Bombay College of Pharmacy, Kalina, Mumbai-400 098, India."}], "LastName": "Majumdar", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7809431", "ISSNLinking": "0250-474X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bocci V.
