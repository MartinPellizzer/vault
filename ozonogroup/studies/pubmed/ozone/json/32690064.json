Therefore, we conducted this study to research the association between air pollutants and outpatient visits in Fuzhou, China.", "We used a generalized linear Poisson model to study the association between air pollution and outpatient visits for respiratory and circulatory diseases from 2016 to 2018 in Fuzhou, China.", "In the single pollutant model, nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) had a significant effect. For lag day 0 to lag day 5, the effect decreased with every 10\u2009\u03bcg/L increase in NO<sub>2</sub>. The daily maximum 8-h mean ozone (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) and upper respiratory outpatient visits were positively associated during the cold period [lag2, excess risk (ER) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.68% (0.44-2.94%)], while O<sub>3</sub>-8h and respiratory disease were positively associated during the warm period [lag5, ER (95% CI): 1.10% (0.11-2.10%) and lag4, ER (95% CI): 1.02% (0.032-2.02%)]. Similarly, particulate matter (PM) with an average aerodynamic diameter of less than 10\u2009\u03bcm (PM<sub>10</sub>) and lower respiratory diseases were positively associated during the warm period [lag0, ER (95% CI): 1.68% (0.44-2.94%)]. When the concentration of O<sub>3</sub>-8h was higher than 100\u2009\u03bcg/L, there was a positive effect on circulatory [lag5, ER (95% CI): 2.83% (0.65-5.06%)], respiratory [lag5, ER (95% CI): 2.47% (0.85-4.11%)] and upper respiratory [lag5, ER (95% CI): 3.06% (1.38-4.77%)] outpatient visits. The variation in O<sub>3</sub>-8h changed slightly when we adjusted for other air pollutants, and after adjusting for O<sub>3</sub>-8h, the ERs of the other air pollutants changed slightly.
