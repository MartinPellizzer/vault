In this study, batch reactors and columns were used to explore the influence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and increased assimilable organic carbon (AOC) due to ozonation pre-treatment on BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal in MAR systems. 8 m column experiments were carried out for 10 months to investigate BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> behavior in anoxic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-reducing zones of MAR systems. Anoxic batch experiments showed that an increase of AOC promoted microbial activity and corresponding BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal. A drastic increase of BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> biodegradation was observed in the sudden absence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in both batch reactors and columns, indicating that BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> competed for biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was preferred as an electron acceptor under the simultaneous presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. However, within 75 days' absence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the anoxic column, BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal gradually decreased, indicating that the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is a precondition for denitrifying bacteria to reduce BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-reducing anoxic zones. In the 8\u00a0m anoxic column set-up (retention time 6 days), the BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal achieved levels as low as 1.3\u00a0\u03bcg/L, starting at 60\u00a0\u03bcg/L (98% removal). Taken together, BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal is likely to occur in vicinity of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-reducing anoxic zones, so MAR systems following ozonation are potentially effective to remove BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
