SR-1) treated with various air pollutants at realistic concentrations that prevail in urban areas. Six-week-old plants responded with an increase in the steady-state mRNA levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase, when exposed to defined and subnecrotic concentrations of automobile exhaust and/or ozone over a period of 48 h. An enhanced expression of genes encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic superoxide dismutases suggested that air pollutants induced considerable oxidative stress. Moreover, wounding or elicitor treatment of plants already exposed to automobile exhaust and/or ozone additionally increased the expression of the above defence genes, but not so in NO(2). Since the main difference between NO(2) and exhaust gas is the absence of the hydrocarbon compounds in the former, we regard hydrocarbons as favourite candidates for the toxic effect of exhaust gas, and they possibly act by generating an enhanced oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Molecular Biology Group, Biozentrum, N-200, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Marie-Curie Str. 9, D-60439 Frankfurt/M, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bahl", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loitsch", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kahl", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091511", "10.1016/0269-7491(94)00079-s", "026974919400079S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
