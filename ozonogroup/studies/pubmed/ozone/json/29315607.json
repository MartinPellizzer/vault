The calculations kept track of the contributions by the sun's direct beam, by diffuse-sky radiance, by radiance reflected from the sea surface and by water-leaving radiance. Clear, hazy and cloudy sky conditions were simulated for a range of solar zenith angles, wind speeds and atmospheric ozone concentrations. The radiances were used to estimate erythemal exposures due to the sun and sky, as well as from radiation reflected by the sea surface and backscattered from the water column. Diffuse-sky irradiance is usually greater than direct-sun irradiance at wavelengths below 330 nm, and reflected and water-leaving irradiance accounts for <20% of the UV exposure on a vertical surface. Total exposure depends strongly on solar zenith angle and azimuth angle relative to the sun. Sea surface roughness affects the UV exposures by only a few percent. For very clear waters and the sun high in the sky, the UV index within the water can be >10 at depths down to two meters and >6 down to 5 m."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 The American Society of Photobiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sequoia Scientific, Inc., Bellevue, WA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mobley", "ForeName": "Curtis D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dermatological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8955-125X"], "LastName": "Diffey", "ForeName": "Brian L", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29315607", "10.1111/php.12885"]}}]}
