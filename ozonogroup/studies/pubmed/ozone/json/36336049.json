The annual average mixing ratio of VOCs was 17.4 \u00b1 10.1 ppbv, with monthly averages ranging from 11.6 to 25.2 ppbv. According to the empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA), O<sub>3</sub> formation during O<sub>3</sub> season was \"VOCs-limited\", while it was in a \"transition\" regime during O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes. In the O<sub>3</sub> season, higher ozone formation potential (OFP) of m/p-xylene, o-xylene, toluene, isopentane, and n-butane were evident during O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes, in line with the increasing contributions of solvent usage and coating, as well as gasoline evaporation to OFP obtained through a matrix factorization model (PMF). Aromatics contributed the most to the secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP). In the non-O<sub>3</sub> season, the contribution of vehicle exhaust to SOAFP elevated on hazy days, thereby revealing the importance of traffic-derived VOCs for PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution. Our results indicate that the prior control of different VOC sources should vary by season, thereby facilitating the synergistic control of O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
