Clone 14 had been already analysed prior to the onset of the experiment. At the end of the 14-month experiment, which incorporated frost events during a simulated winter period, neither symptoms corresponding to those of spruce Type I or IV decline, nor those of ozone damage could be observed. However, the 1986 needles of the trees on soil 1, which exhibit an adequate nutrient content, showed zonal chlorosis independently of the ozone + acid mist treatment. Analysis of variance of chlorophyll contents and needle ages showed a clear reduction to nearly 50% in the 1986 needles of clone 11, soil 1, and clone 16, soil 2. In contrast, clones 14 and 16 (soil 1) formed significantly more chlorophylls during the shorter exposure time in the 1987 flush. The detailed analysis of the individual pigment components of clone 14 needles provided no evidence for a destructive influence of the treatment on the chlorophylls, xanthophylls and beta-carotene in the two needle generations which had developed during the experiment, in spite of the distinct K deficiency of the 1986 needles of the trees on soil 2 and the common chlorosis of the needles of the trees on soil 1. The observed increase in violaxanthin content upon O(3)-treatment observed in clone 14 can be considered as an expression of the protective function of the xanthophylls against photooxidative processes. In conclusion, the observed differences in the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents are better correlated with the individual clone and soil character than with the ozone + acid mist treatment. Comparing the results of the pigment analyses of the needles the differences in the pigment concentrations reflect the N and K contents (Pfirrmann et al., 1990), which differ significantly between the clones. Thus it is not possible to pool the pigment data of all clones without considering the different nutrient levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botanisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t, D-8000 Munich 19, FRG."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Senser", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kloos", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00fctz", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092286", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90052-e", "0269-7491(90)90052-E"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
