No injuries of nerve root and cauda equina nerve,infection were found. There was no significant difference in VAS score between two groups at 1 month after operation (P>0.05),but at 12 months after operation,VAS score of group A was better than that of group B (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in JOA score between two groups at 12 months after operation (P>0.05). According to the functional improvement rate to evaluate the clinical effects,in group A,9 cases got excellent results, 21 good,3 fair;and in group B,6 excellent,18 good,7 fair.
