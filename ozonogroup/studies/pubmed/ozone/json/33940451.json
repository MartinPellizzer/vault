In this study, the freshwater and seawater were selected to investigate the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) decomposition kinetics, bromide transformation and bromate depression, and the evolutions of BrO<sub>3</sub>\u00af under different scavengers were explored to speculate the primary bromate formation pathways. The results showed that the initial O<sub>3</sub> half-live period (t<sub>1/2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>) in seawater was only one-sixth of that in freshwater, and its attenuation rate increased analogously with the increase of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in both freshwater and seawater. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could promote the formation of BrO<sub>3</sub>\u00af via hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) based bromate pathways, nevertheless higher concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> facilitated the reduction of HOBr/OBr\u00af back to Br\u00af, resulting in 87.0% and 73.2% of BrO<sub>3</sub>\u00af retardment in freshwater and seawater, respectively. The suppression ratios of BrO<sub>3</sub>\u00af were up to 48.4% and 35.3% in freshwater with the addition of \u2022OH and \u2022O<sub>2</sub>\u00af scavengers, and the corresponding depressions in seawater decreased to 35.3% and 12.7%, indicating that \u2022OH was dominant on bromate formation when the concentration of residual ozone was adequate to generate some bromine intermediates, meanwhile H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and \u2022O<sub>2</sub>\u00af functioned as the key reductants for bromate depression. Based on these results, the Br\u00af transformation mechanisms via O<sub>3</sub>, \u2022OH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and \u2022O<sub>2</sub>\u00af reactions were speculated, and the feasibility of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-ozonation was verified for the treatment of high Br\u00af-containing seawater."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
