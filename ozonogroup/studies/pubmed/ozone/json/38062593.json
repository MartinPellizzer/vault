Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Experimental Animal Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Aydin Adnan Menderes University, from June to July 2021.", "Twenty-one, female Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups; red beetroot extract group (RBG, n=7), ozonated olive oil group (OOG, n=7), and physiological saline group (CG). Three round wound areas of similar shapes were produced on the back areas. Skin incisions with a diameter of 15 mm were made in rats with a scalpel under anaesthesia protocol. Beetroot extract was applied to RBG, ozonated olive oil to OOG, and saline to CG, once a day for 21 days. Tissue samples were taken from the wounds on the 3rd, 10th, and 21st day of the study, and a histopathological examination (Hematoxylin eosin staining) was performed for haemorrhage, congestion, necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis levels. Wound healing was also determined macroscopically by photography on same days. Serum oxidant (TOS, \u03bcmol H2O2 equivalents/L), antioxidant status (TAS, mmol trolox equivalents/L), serum total thiol (\u03bcmol/L), serum native thiol (\u03bcmol/L) and paraoxonase (PON, U/L) were determined from blood samples on the 21st day.", "Lower inflammation and higher blood antioxidant levels were determined in the RGB and OOG groups compared to the CG. A better wound healing on histology was observed in the OOG group compared to RGB.", "Red beetroot extract and ozonated olive oil enhanced wound healing in female rats.
