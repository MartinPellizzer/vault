Despite their widespread adoption, membrane fouling presents a significant impediment to the broader application of MBRs, necessitating ongoing research and development of effective antifouling strategies. As highly promising, efficient, and environmentally friendly chemical methods for water and wastewater treatment, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have demonstrated exceptional competence in the degradation of pollutants and inactivation of bacteria in aqueous environments, exhibiting considerable potential in controlling membrane fouling in MBRs through direct membrane foulant removal (MFR) and indirect mixed-liquor improvement (MLI). Recent proliferation of research on AOPs-based antifouling technologies has catalyzed revolutionary advancements in traditional antifouling methods in MBRs, shedding new light on antifouling mechanisms. To keep pace with the rapid evolution of MBRs, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive summary and discussion of the antifouling advances of AOPs in MBRs, particularly with a focus on understanding the realizing pathways of MFR and MLI. In this critical review, we emphasize the superiority and feasibility of implementing AOPs-based antifouling technologies in MBRs. Moreover, we systematically overview antifouling mechanisms and strategies, such as membrane modification and cleaning for MFR, as well as pretreatment and in-situ treatment for MLI, based on specific AOPs including electrochemical oxidation, photocatalysis, Fenton, and ozonation. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for selecting antifouling strategies (MFR or MLI) in MBRs, along with proposed regulatory measures for specific AOPs-based technologies according to the operational conditions and energy consumption of MBRs. Finally, we highlight future research prospects rooted in the existing application challenges of AOPs in MBRs, including low antifouling efficiency, elevated additional costs, production of metal sludge, and potential damage to polymeric membranes. The fundamental insights presented in this review aim to elevate research interest and ignite innovative thinking regarding the design, improvement, and deployment of AOPs-based antifouling approaches in MBRs, thereby advancing the extensive utilization of membrane-separation technology in the field of wastewater treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resources Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, College of Environment, Hohai University, 1 Xikang Road, Nanjing 210098, P.
