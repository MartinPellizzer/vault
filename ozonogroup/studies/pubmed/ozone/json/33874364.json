Baladey) and turnip (Brassica rapa L. ev. Sultani) were examined. Exposure to O<sub>3</sub> decreased A in both species, while gs was increased in radish and decreased in turnip. The effect of different concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> , (50, 100, 150 nl l<sup>-1</sup> on radish was examined and it was found that A decreased, while g, increased, with increasing concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> . Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of fumigated leaves showed that the increase in g<sub>s</sub> in radish resulted from the collapse of epidermal cells. Counts of the percentage of stomata which were fully open demonstrated that 80 nl 1<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> caused an increase of 18% in radish and a decrease of 14% in turnip. The proportion of opened stomata was found to increase with increasing O<sub>3</sub> concentration in radish."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berks SL5 7PY, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berks SL5 7PY, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashmore", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berks SL5 7PY, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bell", "ForeName": "J N B", "Initials": "JNB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Aarnes H, Baumann C, Eriksen AB, Sol\u00e5s A, Sundbye A, Solvernes KA. 1993.
