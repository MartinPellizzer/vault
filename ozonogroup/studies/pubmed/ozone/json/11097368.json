Mean extent and severity scores of four lung sites were higher for Los Angeles than Miami residents, with effect of city statistically significant for extent (P=0.02). Also, maximum scores for extent and severity by city were significantly greater for Los Angeles residents (P=0.02, each), but not by smoking history. Smokers did have higher scores for mean extent and severity (by lung site and smoking history), but neither this nor inclusion of smoking and city in the model reached significance. With respect to maximum extent and maximum severity scores, a stratified comparison of cities by smoking history showed a trend (not significant) toward higher scores for Los Angeles residents. Mean extent and severity scores for the lower lobe were higher for basilar sections than for apical sections (each P<0.001). Cumulative data indicate that expanded pathologic studies are essential for efforts to complete a convergence of epidemiological and experimental data implicating exceedences of the Federal ozone standard as a contributor to human lung injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA. sherwin@pathfinder.hsc.usc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sherwin", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richters", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kraft", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richters", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Virchows Arch", "NlmUniqueID": "9423843", "ISSNLinking": "0945-6317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11097368", "10.1007/s004280000262"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
