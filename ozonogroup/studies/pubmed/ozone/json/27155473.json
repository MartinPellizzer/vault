It has been assumed that these different aspects are randomly spread in the symptomatic (injured) regions of the leaf blade. Interestingly, secretory ducts that constitutively produce polyphenols also exhibit these same variations in their vacuolar aspect, in a spatial sequence related to the destiny of these cells (e.g., programmed cell death (PCD) in lytic secretion processes). Here, we demonstrate that the deposition pattern of polyphenols prior to the establishment of the hypersensitive-like response, a type of PCD caused by O3, follows the same one observed in the epithelial cells of the constitutive lysigenous secretory ducts. Astronium graveolens, an early secondary Brazilian woody species, was selected based on its susceptibility to high light and presence of secretory ducts. The synergism effects were assessed by exposing plants to the high O3 concentrations at an urban site in S\u00e3o Paulo City. Confocal, widefield and light microscopies were used to examine polyphenols' occurrence and aspects. The spatial pattern of polyphenols distribution along the leaflets of plants submitted to the synergism condition, in which a dense vacuolar aspect is the target of a cell destined to death, was also observed in the constitutive secretory cells prior to lysis. This similar structural pattern may be a case of homology of process involving both the constitutive (secretory ducts) and the induced (photosynthesizing cells) defenses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
