In this system, ambient air is expanded through a 0.4 mm nozzle to low pressure in a detection chamber, where OH radical is irradiated by the 308 nm laser pulse at a repetition rate of 8.5 kHz. Then, the resultant fluorescence corresponding to the A<sup>2</sup>\u03a3<sup>+</sup>(\u03c5<sup>'</sup>=0)\u2190X<sup>2</sup>\u03a0<sub>i</sub>(\u03bd<sup>''</sup>=0) transition at 308 nm is detected using gated photon counting. The AIOFM-LIF system was integrated into a mobile observing platform for the field observation following the series of laboratory characterization. A portable standard OH radical source by water photolysis-ozone actinometry was established and optimized for accurate system calibration. The factors affecting the system sensitivity were quantified. It was shown that the ultimate system sensitivity is 9.9 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup> cps (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> mw<sup>-1</sup>; the minimum detection limits are (1.84 \u00b1 0.26) \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> and (3.69 \u00b1 0.52) \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> at night and noon, respectively; and the whole error of AIOFM-LIF system is about 16%. Then, the system was deployed in Shenzhen, China, during the \"A comprehensive STudy of the Ozone foRmation Mechanism in Shenzhen\" (STORM) campaign. Valid OH radical concentrations for 31 days were obtained, and the peak of the daily average concentration was 6.6 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> around 12:00. And a high correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77) between OH and j(O<sup>1</sup>D) was also observed in this field campaign. The relationship between OH concentration and NOx was attentively discussed. The deployment of AIOFM-LIF system in STORM campaign has demonstrated its capability of measuring tropospheric OH radical with high sensitivity and accuracy in a polluted environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fengyang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Renzhi", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Pinhua", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yihui", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhiyan", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Huawei", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wenqing", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Opt Express", "NlmUniqueID": "101137103", "ISSNLinking": "1094-4087"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31052893", "10.1364/OE.27.00A419", "407538"]}}]}
