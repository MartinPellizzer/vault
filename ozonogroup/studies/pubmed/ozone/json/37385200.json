The effects of ozone, permanganate, and ferrate (VI) in-situ pretreatment on membrane properties and biofilm formation were systematically studied. Due to the selective retention and adsorption of algal organic matter by biofilms and oxidative degradation, the rejection efficiency of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in algae-laden water pretreated with permanganate by GDM was up to 23.63%. Pre-oxidation extraordinarily postponed flux decline and biofilm formation of GDM and reduced membrane fouling. The total membrane resistance decreased by 87.22%-90.30% within 72\u00a0h after pre-ozonation. Permanganate was more effective than ozone and ferrate (VI) in alleviating secondary membrane fouling caused by algal cells destroyed by pre-oxidation. Extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory revealed that the distribution of electrostatic force (EL), acid-base (AB), and Lifshitz-van der Waals forces (LW) interactions between M. aeruginosa and the released intracellular algogenic organic matter (IOM) and ceramic membrane surface was similar. The membrane and foulants are always attracted to each other by LW interaction at different separation distances. The dominant fouling mechanism of GDM combined with pre-oxidation technology shifts from complete pore blocking to cake layer filtration during operation. After pre-oxidation of algae-laden water by ozone, permanganate, and ferrate (VI), GDM can treat at least 131.8%, 37.0%, and 61.5% more feed solution before forming a complete cake layer. This study provides new insights into the biological fouling control strategies and mechanisms for GDM coupled with oxidation technology, which is expected to alleviate membrane fouling and optimize the feed liquid pretreatment procedure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
