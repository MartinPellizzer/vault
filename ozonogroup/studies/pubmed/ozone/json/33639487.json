Depletion of ozone has increased the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth's surface and recent global warming has caused oceanic acidification as well as dust events, but how these environmental changes will affect CH<sub>3</sub>I concentration in the ocean is unclear. In this study, the spatial distributions and sources of CH<sub>3</sub>I in the atmosphere, seawater, and sediment porewater were measured in the Yellow Sea (YS) and the East China Sea (ECS) between June and July 2018. Higher concentrations in the atmosphere, seawater, and sediment were found in the YS than in the ECS, and surface seawater emissions were discovered to be the major contributors of atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>I concentrations. Anthropogenic pollutants could explain significant spatial variation in the distribution of CH<sub>3</sub>I. High concentrations of CH<sub>3</sub>I in sediment porewater increased diffusion into bottom waters, with diffusive fluxes of 0.2-6.5\u00a0nmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Preliminary results during the in situ seawater incubation experiments showed that the photochemical production rate of CH<sub>3</sub>I ranged from 0.008 to 0.214\u00a0pmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under ultraviolet light, and an enhancement emission of CH<sub>3</sub>I from phytoplankton occurred with the addition of dust, while a reduction of CH<sub>3</sub>I appeared under lower pH conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
