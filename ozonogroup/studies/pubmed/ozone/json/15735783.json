The evaluation included variations in sample air temperature, relative humidity and ozone concentration. Linearity of samples with loading was examined both for a constant concentration with time varied up to 24 h and for different concentrations over 24 h. Reverse diffusion and its increase with accumulation of sample were determined for all compounds. Tubes were examined for blank levels, change of blanks with storage time, and variability of blanks. Method detection limits were determined based on seven replicate samples. Based on this evaluation, 27 VOCs were selected for quantitative monitoring in the concentration range from approximately 0.1 to 4 ppbv. Comparison results of active and diffusive samples taken over 24 h and under the same simulated ambient conditions at a constant 2 ppbv were interpreted to estimate the effective diffusive sampling rates (ml min(-1)) and their uncertainties and to calculate the corresponding diffusive uptake rates (ng ppmv(-1) min(-1))."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Exposure Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McClenny", "ForeName": "William A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "Karen D", "Initials": "KD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacumin", "ForeName": "Henry H", "Initials": "HH", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daughtrey", "ForeName": "E Hunter", "Initials": "EH", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whitaker", "ForeName": "Donald A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "100968688", "ISSNLinking": "1464-0325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15735783", "10.1039/b412213e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
