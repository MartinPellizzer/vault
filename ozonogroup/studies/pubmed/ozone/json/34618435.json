Here, we perform chamber experiments to investigate its gas-phase reactions. We find that the reactions of 1,2-DHI with OH radicals and ozone are rapid (<i>k</i><sub>OH</sub> = 8.0 (\u00b11.3) \u00d7 10<sup>-11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; <i>k</i><sub>O3</sub> = 7.2 (\u00b11.1) \u00d7 10<sup>-18</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). Reaction with OH, which dominates 1,2-DHI loss, leads primarily to fragmentation and radical recycling; major products under both high- and low-NO conditions include hydroxyacetone, glycolaldehyde, and 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methyl-propanal (DHMP). Radical-terminating hydroperoxide formation from the peroxy radical (RO<sub>2</sub>) reaction with HO<sub>2</sub> and organonitrate formation from RO<sub>2</sub> + NO are not observed in the gas phase, possibly due to low volatility; constraints for their branching ratios are instead derived by mass balance. We also measure secondary organic aerosol mass yields from 1,2-DHI (0-23%) and show that oxidation in the presence of aqueous particles leads to formic and acetic acid production. Finally, we incorporate results into GEOS-Chem, a global chemical transport model, to compute the global production (25.3 Tg a<sup>-1</sup>) and gas-phase loss (20.2 Tg a<sup>-1</sup>) of 1,2-DHI and show that its oxidation provides non-negligible contributions to the atmospheric budgets of hydroxyacetone, glycolaldehyde, hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide, formic acid, and DHMP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7544-9580"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California Davis, Davis, California 95616, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for the Environment, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States."}], "LastName": "Bates", "ForeName": "Kelvin H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California Davis, Davis, California 95616, United States."}], "LastName": "Cope", "ForeName": "James D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9206-4359"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California Davis, Davis, California 95616, United States."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Tran B", "Initials": "TB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butadienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0A62964IBU", "NameOfSubstance": "isoprene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Butadienes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34618435", "10.1021/acs.est.1c04177"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
