The results presented herein demonstrate a clear dependence of m-xylene SOA formation potential on NOx, particularly at atmospherically relevant organic aerosol concentration. Experiments with lower NOx levels generated considerably more organic aerosol mass than did experiments with higher NOx levels when reacted m-xylene was held constant. For example, SOA formation from approximately 150 microg m(-3) reacted m-xylene produced 0.6-9.3 microg m(-3) aerosol mass for NOx concentrations ranging from 286 to 10 ppb. The increase in SOA formation was not attributable to changes in ozone and nitrate concentration. A general discussion about possible influences of NOx on SOA formation for this system is included."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bourns College of Engineering--Center for Environmental Research and Technology, and Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Bourns College of Engineering, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Na", "ForeName": "Kwangsam", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cocker", "ForeName": "David R", "Initials": "DR", "Suffix": "3rd"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15926564", "10.1021/es0493244"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
