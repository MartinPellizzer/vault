Higher PM levels for short time periods and lower ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels were present due to meteorological and mountain valley conditions. Nitrogenous pollutants were relatively strongly correlated with PM variables. Diurnal cycles of NO<sub>x</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and fine PM(PM 2.5)\u00a0(aerodynamic diameter <2.5 \u03bcm [PM<sub>2.5</sub>]) suggested formation from NO<sub>x</sub>. O<sub>3</sub> levels increased from early morning into midafternoon, and NO<sub>x</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased throughout the morning, followed by sharp decreases. Toluene/benzene and xylenes/benzene ratios and VOC correlations with nitrogenous and PM species were indicative of local traffic sources. Wind sector comparisons suggested that pollutant levels were lower when winds were from nearby mountains to the east versus winds from northerly or southerly origins. <i>Implications</i>: The Cache Valley in Idaho and Utah has been designated a PM<sub>2.5</sub> nonattainment area that has been attributed to air pollution buildup during winter stagnation events. To inform state implementation plans for PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Cache Valley and other PM<sub>2.5</sub> nonattainment areas in Utah, a state and multiagency federal research effort known as the UWFPS was conducted in winter 2017. As part of the UWFPS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) measured ground-based PM species and their precursors, VOCs, and meteorology in Logan, Utah. Results reported here from the EPA study in Logan provide additional understanding of wintertime air pollution conditions and possible sources of PM and gaseous pollutants as well as being useful for future PM control strategies in this area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukerjee", "ForeName": "Shaibal", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Alion Science and Technology , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Luther", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Russell", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Senior Environmental Employment Program , Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lonneman", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaushik", "ForeName": "Surender", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Colon", "ForeName": "Maribel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "Karen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a National Exposure Research Laboratory , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whitaker", "ForeName": "Donald", "Initials": "D"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CDA 13-024", "Acronym": "HX", "Agency": "HSRD VA", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "EP-C-15-008", "Acronym": "EPA", "Agency": "EPA", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "EPA999999", "Acronym": "ImEPA", "Agency": "Intramural EPA", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Utah"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 1998. \nToxicological profile for chloromethane.
