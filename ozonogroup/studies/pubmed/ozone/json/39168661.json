To quantify the regional background and spatial-temporal variations of O<sub>3</sub>, a comprehensive study was conducted using multiple methods including principal component analysis \uff08PCA\uff09 and TCEQ, with Henan Province as a case study. Based on monitoring data from 59 national sites in Henan Province during 2019-2021, four methods were employed to estimate the regional background of O<sub>3</sub>. Method 1 was the traditional method, performing O<sub>3</sub> univariate-multisite PCA analysis. Method 2 was a multivariate-single-site PCA analysis considering nitrogen dioxide and meteorological conditions as constraints. Method 3 combined PCA and multiple linear regression \uff08MLR\uff09 to determine regional background contributions, drawing on the idea of source apportionment. Method 4 was the TCEQ method that used the lowest measured O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration as the regional background. The estimation results showed that Methods 1 and 2 were basically equal, and Methods 3 and 4 were approximately 37-60 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> lower than Method 1. From 2019 to 2021, the changes in regional background <i>\u03c1</i>\uff08O<sub>3</sub>-8h\uff09 estimated by Methods 1-4 were 1.6, -13.4, 5.9, and -3.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The average estimations derived from multiple methods showed that the regional background <i>\u03c1</i>\uff08O<sub>3</sub>-8h\uff09 in Henan Province from 2019 to 2021 concentrations were 82.0, 79.0, and 79.7 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, accounting for 75.9%, 76.4%, and 78.7% of the total regional O<sub>3</sub>-8h, respectively. The regional background O<sub>3</sub>-8h estimated by the four methods showed obvious seasonal changes, characterized by summer &gt; spring &gt; fall &gt; winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yong", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Fang-Cheng", "Initials": "FC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Ji-Qiang", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geographic Sciences, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Key Laboratory for Synergistic Prevention of Water and Soil Environmental Pollution, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39168661", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202308191"]}}]}
