In this study, a novel method was developed that utilizes heavy oxygen (<sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) for the production of heavy ozone ([<sup>18</sup>O<sub>1</sub>]O<sub>2</sub>, [<sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>]O<sub>1</sub>, [<sup>18</sup>O<sub>3</sub>]) to actively label OPs from oxygen transfer reactions. To establish and validate this new approach, venlafaxine with a well-described oxygen transfer reaction (tertiary amine -> N-oxide) was chosen as a model compound. Observed <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratios in the major OP venlafaxine N-oxide (NOV) correlated with expected <sup>18</sup>O purities based on tracer experiments. These results confirmed the successful labeling with heavy oxygen and furthermore demonstrate the potential to monitor NOV as an indicator of <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratios during ozonation. As a next step, <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratios were used to elucidate the formation mechanism of previously described OPs from sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Seven OPs were detected including the frequently described nitro-SMX, which was formed with a maximum yield of 3.2% (of initial SMX). With the successful labeling of six of the seven OPs from sulfamethoxazole, it was possible to confirm their previously proposed formation pathways, and to distinguish oxygen transfer from electron transfer reactions. <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratios in OPs indicate that hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and formation of nitro-groups mostly follows oxygen transfer reactions, while electron transfer reactions initiate the formation of hydroxylamine and the abstraction of NH<sub>2</sub> leading to catechol."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
