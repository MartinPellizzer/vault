All the rats, except for those in the blank control group, were subjected to hypodermic injection of bovine collagen II and complete Freunds adjuvant to induce RA. Ozone treatment was administered once weekly for 3 weeks starting at 21 days after the modeling. The swelling and thickness of the hind paws were observed, and the serum and synovial contents of TNF-\u03b1, TNFR I, and TNFR II were detected.", "At the end of treatment, the paw thickness was reduced significantly in rats with 40 \u00b5g/ml ozone injection compared with that in the model RA group (P<0.01). The serum contents of TNF-\u03b1, TNFR I and TNFR II showed no significant difference between the RA model group, oxygen group and the ozone groups, but their synovial contents showed significant reductions in rats with 40 and 50 \u00b5g/ml ozone injection (P<0.01); the synovial TNFR I was significantly higher in 40 \u00b5g/ml ozone group than in the model group (P<0.05).", "Intra-articular injection of 40 \u00b5g/ml ozone can attenuate synovitis in rats with RA, the mechanism of which may involve the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and TNFR II activity and enhancement of TNFR I activity in the synovium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. yubinol@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hui-qiang", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chang-huai", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Qing-rong", "Initials": "QR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bo-wei", "Initials": "BW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Cheng-he", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "101266132", "ISSNLinking": "1673-4254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tnfrsf1a protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Rheumatoid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intra-Articular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21690068"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
