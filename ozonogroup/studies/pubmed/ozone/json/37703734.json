The reaction between ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and o-dianisidine result in a visible yellowish color change. Unlike previous passive methods that rely on nitrate extraction or the color disappearance of indigotrisulfonate, the OPS offered improved recognition of average O<sub>3</sub> exposure. To optimize OPS based on time-weighted average (TWA), we extracted and quantified the amount of reacted o-dianisidine after exposing OPS to O<sub>3</sub> by varying concentrations (0-200 ppb) within 8\u00a0h. Colorimetric changes of OPS were further analyzed by capturing images, and the effective absorbance of blue scale showed the best fit (EA<sub>B</sub>, R<sup>2</sup> =0.997). OPS validation on visual detection assessed by six parameters: limit of detection, limit of quantification, reproducibility, sampling rate, selectivity to interfering gases, and sensitivity to environmental factors. To enhance visibility, the OPS was assembled with coloration exposure guidelines, and a smartphone app was developed to quantify average O<sub>3</sub> exposures. We further conducted field tests that showed the significant disparity between O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and personal O<sub>3</sub> exposures, which is considered more crucial for assessing health risks. The OPS was optimized to monitor O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels and raise awareness among workers and occupants regarding invisible indoor hazards."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
