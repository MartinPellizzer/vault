The CAMx simulations compared fairly well with the hourly concentrations of ozone. Simulation results also showed that Pingtung City was mainly a volatile organic compounds (VOC)-sensitive regime, while Chao-Chou Town was either a VOC-sensitive or a NOx-sensitive regime, depending on the seasons. Measurements of three photochemical indicators (H2O2, HNO3, and NOy) were conducted, and simulated three transition ranges of H2O2/HNO3 (0.5-0.8), O3/HNO3 (10.3-16.2) and O3/NOy (5.7-10.8) were adopted to assess the ozone sensitive regime at the three sites. The results indicated that the three transition ranges yield consistent results with CAMx simulations at most times at Pingtung City. However, both VOC-sensitive and NOx-sensitive regimes were important at the rural site Chao-Chou Town. Kenting Town, a touring site at the southern end of Taiwan, was predominated by a NOx-sensitive regime in four seasons."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering, \"National\" Taiwan University Taipei 106, Taiwan, China. yppeng@ntu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yen-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kang-Shin", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hsin-Kai", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Chia-Hsiang", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ming-Hsun", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Cheng-Haw", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21790052", "10.1016/s1001-0742(10)60479-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
