However, the underlying mechanisms by which soil microbes respond to these environmental changes remain poorly understood. The prevailing hypothesis, which states that CO\u2082- or O\u2083-induced changes in carbon (C) availability dominate microbial responses, is primarily based on results from nitrogen (N)-limiting forests and grasslands. It remains largely unexplored how soil microbes respond to elevated CO\u2082 and O\u2083 in N-rich or N-aggrading systems, which severely hinders our ability to predict the long-term soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Using a long-term field study conducted in a no-till wheat-soybean rotation system with open-top chambers, we showed that elevated CO\u2082 but not O\u2083 had a potent influence on soil microbes. Elevated CO\u2082(1.5\u00d7ambient) significantly increased, while O\u2083 (1.4\u00d7ambient) reduced, aboveground (and presumably belowground) plant residue C and N inputs to soil. However, only elevated CO\u2082 significantly affected soil microbial biomass, activities (namely heterotrophic respiration) and community composition. The enhancement of microbial biomass and activities by elevated CO\u2082 largely occurred in the third and fourth years of the experiment and coincided with increased soil N availability, likely due to CO\u2082-stimulation of symbiotic N\u2082 fixation in soybean. Fungal biomass and the fungi\u2236bacteria ratio decreased under both ambient and elevated CO\u2082 by the third year and also coincided with increased soil N availability; but they were significantly higher under elevated than ambient CO\u2082. These results suggest that more attention should be directed towards assessing the impact of N availability on microbial activities and decomposition in projections of soil organic C balance in N-rich systems under future CO\u2082 scenarios."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, United States of America."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "Fitzgerald L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burkey", "ForeName": "Kent O", "Initials": "KO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Cong", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shew", "ForeName": "H David", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rufty", "ForeName": "Thomas W", "Initials": "TW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fiscus", "ForeName": "Edwin L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deforest", "ForeName": "Jared L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Shuijin", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Drake BG, GonzalezMeler MA, Long SP.
