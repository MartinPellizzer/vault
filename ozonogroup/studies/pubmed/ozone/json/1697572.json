Muscarinic reactivity in vivo was determined by measuring specific airway resistance (sRaw) in response to increasing concentrations of aerosolized acetylcholine (ACh) administered before and 30 min after exposure. Immediately after reactivity testing, multiple tracheal rings from ozone- and air-exposed animals were prepared and the contractile responses to increasing concentrations of substance P, ACh, or KCl were assessed in the presence of 10 microM indomethacin with or without 1 microM phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase. Isometric force generation in vitro was measured on stimulation by cumulative concentrations of the agonists, and force generation (in g/cm2) was calculated after determination of muscle cross-sectional area. The smooth muscle of mucosa-intact airways from guinea pigs with ozone-induced bronchial hyper-reactivity proved to be hyperresponsive in vitro to substance P and ACh but not to KCl. Pretreatment with phosphoramidon abolished the increase in substance P responsiveness but had no effect on muscarinic hyperresponsiveness after ozone exposure. Furthermore, substance P responsiveness was not augmented in ozone-exposed airways in which the mucosa had been removed before testing in vitro. Likewise, muscarinic hyperresponsiveness was not present in ozone-exposed airways without mucosa. Our data indicate that airway smooth muscle responsiveness is increased in guinea pigs with ozone-induced bronchial hyperreactivity and suggest that this hyperresponsiveness may be linked to non-cyclooxygenase mucosa-derived factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Rush University, Chicago, Illinois 60612."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murlas", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "T P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chodimella", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-01965", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL-34228-04", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "OH-00060", "Acronym": "OH", "Agency": "NIOSH CDC HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Muscarinic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Neprilysin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Airway Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mucous Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neprilysin"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Muscarinic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1697572", "10.1152/jappl.1990.69.1.7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
