Here, a case study was performed at an O<sub>3</sub>-polluted city, Wuhu, in Yangtze River Delta region of China to investigate O<sub>3</sub> variation trend and the relationship to its precursors after implementation of Clean Air Action Plan Phase II, which aims to reduce O<sub>3</sub> pollution. The results showed that peak O<sub>3</sub> concentration was effectively reduced since Clean Air Action Plan Phase II. Due to significant NOx reduction, O<sub>3</sub> formation tended to shift from volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regimes to NOx-limited regimes during 2018-2022. VOC/NOx ratios measured in 2022 revealed that peak O<sub>3</sub> concentration tended to respond positively to NOx. Apart from high-O<sub>3</sub> period, Wuhu was still in a VOC-limited regime. The relationship of maximum daily 8-h ozone average and NO<sub>2</sub> followed a lognormal distribution with an inflection point at 20\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> of NO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that Wuhu should conduct joint control of VOC and NOx with a focus on VOC reduction before the inflection point. Alkenes and aromatics were suggested to be preferentially controlled due to their higher ozone formation potentials. Using random forest meteorological normalization method, meteorology had a positive effect on O<sub>3</sub> concentration in 2018, 2019 and 2022, but a negative effect in 2020 and 2021. The meteorology could explain 44.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.1% of the O<sub>3</sub> variation during 2018-2022. High temperature favors O<sub>3</sub> production and O<sub>3</sub> pollution occurred more easily when temperature was over 25\u00a0\u00b0C, while high relative humidity inhibits O<sub>3</sub> generation and no O<sub>3</sub> pollution was found at relative humidity above 70%. This study unveils some new insights into the trend of urban O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Yangtze River Delta region since Clean Air Action Plan Phase II and the findings provide important references for formulating control strategies against O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
