Nevertheless, many studies have disregarded the potentially mixed effects of air pollutants on reproductive outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study involving 8048 women with 9445 cycles undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) in China, from 2017 to 2021. A land-use random forest model was applied to estimate daily residential exposure to air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Individual and joint associations between air pollutants and oocyte-related outcomes of ART were evaluated. In 90 days prior to oocyte pick-up to oocyte pick-up (period A), NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and CO was negatively associated with total oocyte yield. In the 90 days prior to oocyte pick-up to start of gonadotropin medication (Gn start, period B), there was a negative dose-dependent association of exposure to five air pollutants with total oocyte yield and mature oocyte yield. In Qgcomp analysis, increasing the multiple air pollutants mixtures by one quartile was related to reducing the number of oocyte pick-ups by -2.00\u202f% (95\u202f%CI: -2.78\u202f%, -1.22\u202f%) in period A, -2.62\u202f% (95\u202f%CI: -3.40 %, -1.84\u202f%) in period B, and -0.98\u202f% (95\u202f%CI: -1.75\u202f%, -0.21\u202f%) in period C. During period B, a 1-unit increase in the WQS index of multiple air pollutants exposure was associated with fewer number of total oocyte (-1.27\u202f%, 95\u202f%CI: -2.16\u202f%, -0.36\u202f%) and mature oocyte (-1.42\u202f%, 95\u202f%CI: -2.41\u202f%, -0.43\u202f%). O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were major contributors with adverse effects on the mixed associations. Additionally, period B appears to be the susceptible window. Our study implies that exposure to air pollution adversely affects oocyte-related outcomes, which raises concerns about the potential adverse impact of air pollution on women's reproductive health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
