We developed an animal model of active versus sedentary life style by providing female Sprague-Dawley rats with continuous access to running wheels. Sedentary rats were housed in standard cages without wheels. After training for 12 wks, rats were exposed to 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0\u2009ppm ozone [O3 for 5\u2009h/d, 1 d/wk, for 6 wk (N\u2009=\u200910 per group)]. Body composition (%fat, lean and fluid) was monitored noninvasively over the course of the study. Ventilatory parameters [tidal volume, minute ventilation, frequency and enhanced pause (Penh)] were assessed using whole-body plethysmography prior to O3 and 24\u2009h after the 5th O3 exposure. Trained rats lost \u223c2% body fat after 12 wk of access to running wheels. Peak wheel activity was reduced by 40% after exposure to 1.0\u2009ppm O3. After the 5th O3 exposure, body weight and %fat were reduced in sedentary but not trained rats. Penh was significantly elevated in sedentary but not trained rats the day after exposure to 1.0\u2009ppm O3. However, lung lavage cell counts and biomarkers of pulmonary inflammation measured 1\u2009day after the final exposure were inconsistently affected by training. Wheel running led to marked physiological responses along with some indication of improved pulmonary recovery from O3 exposure. However, wheel running with O3 exposure may also be a detriment for some pulmonary endpoints. Overall, a sedentary lifestyle may increase susceptibility to O3, but additional studies are needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Gordon", "ForeName": "Christopher J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Pamela M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Beasley", "ForeName": "Tracey E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Ledbetter", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Physiology , Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Uludag , Bursa , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aydin", "ForeName": "Cenk", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Snow", "ForeName": "Samantha J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Environmental Public Health Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA , and."}], "LastName": "Kodavanti", "ForeName": "Urmila P", "Initials": "UP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxicity Assessment Division , Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Research Triangle Park, NC , USA ."}], "LastName": "Johnstone", "ForeName": "Andrew F", "Initials": "AF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Composition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plethysmography, Whole Body"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sedentary Behavior"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27160658", "10.3109/08958378.2016.1163441"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
