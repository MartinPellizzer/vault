In this study, a KZ (Kolmogorov-Zurbenko) filter was used to decompose the time series of O<sub>3</sub> concentration and simultaneous meteorological factors into corresponding short-term, seasonal, and long-term components in 31 provincial capitals.Then, the stepwise regression was used to establish the relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and meteorological factors. Ultimately, the long-term component of O<sub>3</sub> concentration after \"meteorological adjustment\" was reconstructed. The results indicated that the first spatial patterns of O<sub>3</sub> concentration showed a convergent change, that is, the volatility of O<sub>3</sub> concentration was weakened in the high-value region of variability and enhanced in the low-value region.Before and after the meteorological adjustment, the variation trend of O<sub>3</sub> concentration in different cities was different to some extent. The adjusted curve was \"flatter\" in most cities. Among them, Fuzhou, Haikou, Changsha, Taiyuan, Harbin, and Urumqi were greatly affected by emissions. Shijiazhuang, Jinan, and Guangzhou were greatly affected by meteorological conditions. Beijing, Tianjin, Changchun, and Kunming were greatly affected by emissions and meteorological conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hao-Qi", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yu-Fen", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zhong-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Qi-Li", "Initials": "QL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jian-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environment Protection Key Laboratory of Urban Particulate Air Pollution Prevention, China Meteorological Administration-Nankai University Cooperative Laboratory for Atmospheric Environment-Health Research, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300350, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yin-Chang", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37040932", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202204070"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
