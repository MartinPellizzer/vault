Extensive gaseous (i.e. nitric acid, ammonia, sulfur dioxide) and particle (i.e. PM2.5 and PM10 mass, elements, ions, carbon) measurements were acquired for 11 days during the summer at nine locations, and six days during the fall at six locations. Outliers were identified so that they could be excluded from further statistical analyses. Carbon and elemental measurements were found to be negatively biased by \u223c 20% owing to inhomogenous aerosol deposits on the SCAQS filters and analysis methods which were applied to a portion of the filters. These biases seem relatively consistent, however, and should not affect conclusions drawn from data analysis efforts if they are appropriately considered. Significant fractions (30-60%) of ammonium nitrate volatilized during the summer when temperatures were higher. Less than 10% typically volatilized during the fall when temperatures were lower. Anion/cation balances support the accuracy and precision estimates of the nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium measurements. Coarse particle sulfate was generally low, while coarse particle nitrate was most pronounced at the coastal sites.This paper documents SCAQS filter-based aerosol measurement methods, and evaluates the accuracy, precision, and validity of the data set. Various comparisons were made for: (1) PM2.5/PM10 ratios for mass and major chemical species; (2) sum of chemical species versus measured mass; (3) sulfate versus sulfur ratios; (4) PM2.5 particulate nitrate versus nitric acid-denuded nitrate; and (5) anion/cation balances. The measurement and evaluation techniques presented in this paper serve as a guideline for other data analysis and modeling studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Desert Research Institute, University and Community College System of Nevada, P.O.
