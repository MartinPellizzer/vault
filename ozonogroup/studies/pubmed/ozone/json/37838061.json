Many chemical compounds except for nitrogen dioxide, formic acid, and benzene showed seasonal variations with high concentrations in summer and low concentrations in winter. In particular, formaldehyde, nonanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate, and ammonia concentrations showed remarkable seasonal variation. For example, the concentration of formaldehyde in February and August was 5.9 and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, a difference of about 7 times. Although there were large differences in the concentrations in each house, the fluctuation pattern was almost the same every year in each house. By contrast, nitrogen dioxide, formic acid, and benzene concentrations were low in summer and high in winter. These compounds were generated by kerosine and gas stoves in winter. Long-term continuous monitoring revealed that annual mean concentrations could be estimated using data from February and August. Personal exposure concentrations could be classified into four patterns: chemicals affected by the indoor environment such as formaldehyde, chemicals affected by the outdoor environment such as ozone, chemicals affected by the occupational environment such as hexane, and background level chemicals such as benzene (without kerosine and gas stoves). Indoor and outdoor measurements are means to investigate the \"health\" of each environment. Personal exposure measurement using PSD-samplers is suitable for assessing the health risk of chemical compounds to humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
