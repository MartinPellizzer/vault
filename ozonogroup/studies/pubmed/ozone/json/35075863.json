Furthermore, it explored the influence of pH, ozone dosing quantity, catalyst dosing quantity, different anions, and background of water quality conditions on the IBP degradation efficiency. The results showed that, compared with that of some common carbon-based catalysts (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, biochar, and granular-activated carbon) and metal catalysts (MnO<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), the N-C catalytic ozone system had a very outstanding oxidation degradation performance of organic pollutants; the removal rate of IBP reached 100% in 5 min, and the utilization rate of ozone was increased from 10% to 46%. The treatment efficiency of the system was enhanced with the increase in pH. Compared with that by increasing the ozone dosage, the treatment capacity of the system was significantly improved by increasing the concentration of catalyst. The quenching experiment and EPR further confirmed that N-C could effectively catalyze ozone to produce more reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals (\u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It was also found that\u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> was the main active substance in the reaction system and played a leading role in the degradation of IBP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Human Settlements and Civil Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Human Settlements and Civil Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Human Settlements and Civil Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chen-Xi", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi'an 710055, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Human Settlements and Civil Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Peng-Kang", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "biochar"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WK2XYI10QM", "NameOfSubstance": "Ibuprofen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ibuprofen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manganese Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35075863", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202106025"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
