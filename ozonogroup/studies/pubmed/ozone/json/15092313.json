Twelve tubes in each of three replications/treatment were fumigated in continuously-stirred tank reactors in a greenhouse for 6 h/day on 4 consecutive days/week. Soil was watered 3 days/week with deionized water amended with ions and adjusted to pH 4.3 with H2SO4 + HNO3 (70 meq SO4(2-): 30 meq NO3(-)). After 10 weeks the amount of soil surface covered by moss (predominantly Ditrichum pusillum, but also D. lineare, and Pohlia nutans) was estimated visually and assigned a rating on a scale of: 1 = 0-25%; 2 = 26-50%; 3 = 51-75%; 4 = 76-100%. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant (p < 0.001) negative relationship between coverage ratings and O3 concentration. Surface coverage in tubes exposed to 0.32 or 0.24 ppm was about half of that for 0.00 ppm (mean ratings of 1.1, 1.4 and 2.6, respectively). Coverage differences appeared to be due in part to O3 suppression of plant numbers. Linear regression analysis also revealed a significant (p < 0.001) negative relationship between heights of D. pusillum plants (measured after 12 weeks treatment) and O3 concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Box 7616, Raleigh, NC 27695-7616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stanosz", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "V L", "Initials": "VL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bruck", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092313", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90138-3", "0269749190901383"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
