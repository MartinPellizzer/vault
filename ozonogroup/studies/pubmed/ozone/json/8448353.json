In addition, two novel products were identified as epimers of 10-acetyl-7-(4',8',12'-trimethyltridecyl)-3,4,7-trimethyl-2-oxo- 1,6-dioxaspiro[4.5]-deca-3,9-diene. These spiro products were formed in equal amounts in a combined yield of approximately 33% after complete alpha-tocopherol oxidation. Ozonation of the vitamin E model compound 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-ol yielded an analogous spiro product, 10-acetyl-3,4,7,7-tetramethyl-2-oxo-1,6-dioxaspiro[4.5]deca-3,9-di ene, whose structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The spiro products may be formed by ozone addition to the chroman ring and subsequent rearrangement to ring-opened hydroxyacid products, which yield spiro products by ring closure due to dehydration. Novel spiro products formed by ozonation of vitamin E may be unique markers of ozone interaction with lipid structures that contain vitamin E."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liebler", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iitaka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA47943", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chem Res Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807448", "ISSNLinking": "0893-228X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "950-99-2", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-1-hydroxychroman"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chromans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8448353", "10.1021/tx00031a011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
