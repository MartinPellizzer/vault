Emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O from agricultural soils are affected by a number of global change factors, such as elevated air temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Yet, a mechanistic understanding of how these climatic factors affect N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in agricultural soils remains largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission pathway using a <sup>15</sup>N tracing approach in a nine-year field experiment using a combined temperature and free air carbon dioxide enrichment (T-FACE). We show that the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment completely counteracts warming-induced stimulation of both nitrification- and denitrification-derived N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. The elevated CO<sub>2</sub> induced decrease in pH and labile organic nitrogen (N) masked the stimulation of organic carbon and N by warming. Unexpectedly, both elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and warming had little effect on the abundances of the nitrifying and denitrifying genes. Overall, our study confirms the importance of multifactorial experiments to understand N<sub>2</sub>O emission pathways from agricultural soils under climate change. This better understanding is a prerequisite for more accurate models and the development of effective options to combat climate change."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
