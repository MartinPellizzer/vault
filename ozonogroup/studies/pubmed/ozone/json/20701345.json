The rate coefficients obtained (in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) units) were as follows: k(methyl methacrylate) = (6.7 +/- 0.9) x 10(-18), k(methyl acrylate) = (0.95 +/- 0.07) x 10(-18), and k(ethyl acrylate) = (1.3 +/- 0.1) x 10(-18). In addition to formaldehyde being observed as a product of the three reactions, the other major reaction products were methyl pyruvate from reaction of ozone with methyl methacrylate, methyl glyoxylate from reaction of ozone with methyl acrylate, and ethyl glyoxylate from reaction of ozone with ethyl acrylate. Possible reaction mechanisms leading to the observed products are presented and discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICARE-CNRS, 1C Avenue de la Recherche Scientifique, 45071 Orl\u00e9ans, Cedex 02, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernard", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eyglunent", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Da\u00eble", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mellouki", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20701345", "10.1021/jp104451v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
