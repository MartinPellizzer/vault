Soil water potential was maintained near pot capacity (-0.03 MPa) or soil was allowed to dry to approximately -1.0 MPa and resaturated. Chlorotic mottling and flecking of needles due to O(3) injury were observed for seedlings from all pine families. Soil water deficit lessened the intensity of O(3) symptoms, possibly due to stomatal closure. Exposure to O(3) and soil water deficit each resulted in less seedling volume growth and dry weight, and changed the nonstructural carbohydrate content of seedlings compared with controls. Increasing O(3) concentrations resulted in a linear reduction in foliar starch content but did and affect hexose or sucrose content. Soil water deficit resulted in less starch and soluble sugar contents in above- and below-ground plant parts compared with controls. Soil water deficit did not affect numbers or percentages of roots that formed ectomycorrhizal tips. A linear dose-response relationship between O(3) and ectomycorrhizae was observed. The number of ectomycorrhizal tips/cm long root and the percentage of feeder roots that formed ectomycorrhizae were lower as O(3) concentration increased. Overall, each stress alone caused less seedling growth and carbohydrate content compared with controls, but only O(3) was responsible for suppression of ectomycorrhizae."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meier", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grand", "ForeName": "L F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schoeneberger", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reinert", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bruck", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092304", "10.1016/0269-7491(90)90092-q", "0269-7491(90)90092-Q"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
