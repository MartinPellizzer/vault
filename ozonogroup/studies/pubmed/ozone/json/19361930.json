Traditional cleaning methods such as plasma, UV-ozone and solvent treatments have their shortcomings. Here, we demonstrate that calibration gratings with supersharp spikes can be employed to scrub away contaminants accumulated on a colloidal sphere probe by scanning the probe against the spikes at high load at constant-force mode. The present method is superior to traditional cleaning methods in several aspects. First, accumulated lump-like organic/inorganic material can be removed; second, removal is non-destructive and highly efficient based on a \"targeted removal\" strategy; third, removal and probe shape/morphology study can be completed in a single step (we report, to our best knowledge, the first evidence of the wear of the colloidal sphere during force measurements); and fourth, both colloidal/particle probes and standard but supersharp AFM imaging tips can be treated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China. ygan@hit.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Franks", "ForeName": "George V", "Initials": "GV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ultramicroscopy", "NlmUniqueID": "7513702", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3991"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19361930", "10.1016/j.ultramic.2009.03.019", "S0304-3991(09)00089-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
