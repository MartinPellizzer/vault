The low-volatility products can enhance new particle formation and particle growth and thus influence climate feedback. Here, we present the results of \u03b1-pinene and \u0394-3-carene photooxidation experiments conducted in continuous-flow mode in an environmental chamber under several reaction conditions. The roles of oxidants, addition of NO, and VOC molecular structure in influencing SOA yield are illustrated. SOA yield from \u03b1-pinene photooxidation shows a weak dependence on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, which is a proxy for HO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The high O/C ratios observed in the \u03b1-pinene photooxidation products suggest the production of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM). Addition of ozone to the chamber during low-NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> photooxidation experiments leads to higher SOA yield. With the addition of NO, the production of N-containing HOMs is enhanced and the SOA yield shows a modest, nonlinear dependence on the input NO concentration. Carene photooxidation leads to higher SOA yield than \u03b1-pinene under similar reaction conditions, which agrees with the lower volatility retrieved from evaporation kinetics experiments. These results improve the understanding of SOA formation from monoterpene photooxidation and could be applied to refine the representation of biogenic SOA formation in models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7238-593X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jiumeng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3041-9027"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}], "LastName": "D'Ambro", "ForeName": "Emma L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5057-2168"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ben Hwan", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}], "LastName": "Schobesberger", "ForeName": "Siegfried", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Bell", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9874-8807"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Zaveri", "ForeName": "Rahul A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Zelenyuk", "ForeName": "Alla", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, United States."}], "LastName": "Thornton", "ForeName": "Joel A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3728-0195"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, United States."}], "LastName": "Shilling", "ForeName": "John E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35976919", "10.1021/acs.est.2c02630"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
