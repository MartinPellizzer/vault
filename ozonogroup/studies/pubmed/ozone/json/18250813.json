From differential transmission the concentration of the gas is deduced. The effect of multiple-scattering on the deduced concentration is shown for conservative scattering aerosols for which the multiple scattering by the aerosols is differentially absorbed by the gas and for nonconservative scattering aerosols for which the multiple scattering is differentially absorbed by the aerosols as well as differentially absorbed by the gas. The two-stream analytical model (with no dependence on the field of view) shows good qualitative agreement (especially for a small field of view) with a numerical radiative transfer model in which the trace gas concentration is computed for the different detector's field of view."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ben-David", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18250813", "10.1364/ao.36.001386", "42511"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
