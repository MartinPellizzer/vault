Three millimeters of the material was ground from the midsection and filled with the soft liner. The resilient liner specimens (n=40) used for the hardness test were 10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height. Cylindrical and disc-shaped samples were randomly divided into four groups (37\u00b0C distilled water, Corega<sup>\u00ae</sup> tablets, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and a home ozone generator). To simulate six months of denture cleansing clinically, samples were placed in their cleanser once a day for six months according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cylindrical specimens were placed under tension until failure in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/minute. For disc-shaped samples, hardness was measured using a Shore-A durometer. The results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey's post hoc test.", "The mean tensile bond strength was not significantly different among the studied groups (P>0.05). The mean hardness in the ozone and Corega tablet groups was significantly lower than that of the control and NaOCl groups (P<0.05).", "The type of denture cleanser does not affect the tensile bond strength of silicone soft liners.
