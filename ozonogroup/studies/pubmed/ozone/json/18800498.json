Using 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) as a representative steroid estrogen, several oxidants applied in wastewater treatment (chlorine, bromine, ozone, hydroxyl radical, chlorine dioxide, and ferrate) were shown to selectively and rapidly transform EE2. For typically applied oxidant doses, these transformations occur in the time range of seconds to minutes. The resulting initial transformation products of EE2 exhibit a substantially lower in vitro estrogenic activity (< 13% of EE2). For selected structural derivatives of EE2, a quantitative structure-activity relationship was established between substituents changed on the phenolic moiety and the relative in vitro estrogenic activity. In addition, the initial EE2 transformation products that still exhibit residual estrogenic activity are quickly further transformed by most of the tested oxidants. Therefore, oxidative wastewater treatment may serve as a powerful tool to remove estrogenic activity induced by steroid estrogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, CH-8600, D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yunho", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Escher", "ForeName": "Beate I", "Initials": "BI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Von Gunten", "ForeName": "Urs", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18800498", "10.1021/es7023302"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
