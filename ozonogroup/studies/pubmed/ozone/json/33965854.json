In this context, an investigation of ambient concentrations and variation characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors in May and June from 2014 to 2017 in a typical urban area of Beijing was carried out, and the formation sensitivity and different causes of heavy O<sub>3</sub> pollution (HOP, daily maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> (MDA8h O<sub>3</sub>)>124\u00a0ppbv) were analyzed. The results showed that the monthly assessment values of the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile MDA8h O<sub>3</sub> within one month) were highest in May or June from 2014 to 2017, and the values presented an overall increasing trend. During this period, the number of O<sub>3</sub> pollution days (MDA8h O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0>\u00a075\u00a0ppbv) also showed an increasing trend. During the HOP episodes, the concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) were higher than their respective mean values in May and June, and the meteorological conditions were more conducive to atmospheric photochemical reactions. The HOP episodes were mainly caused by local photochemical formation. From 2014 to 2017, O<sub>3</sub> formation during the HOP episodes shifted from VOC and NO<sub>X</sub> mixed-limited to VOC-limited conditions, and O<sub>3</sub> formation was most sensitive to anthropogenic VOCs. Six categories of VOC sources were identified, among which vehicular exhaust contributed the most to anthropogenic VOCs. The VOC concentrations and OFPs of anthropogenic sources have decreased significantly in recent years, indicating that VOC control measures have been effective in Beijing. Nevertheless, NO<sub>X</sub> concentrations did not show an evident decreasing trend in the same period. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to O<sub>3</sub> pollution control in May and June; control measure adjustments are needed according to the changes in O<sub>3</sub> precursors, and coordinated control of VOCs and NO<sub>X</sub> should be strengthened in long-term planning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
