As a result, new treatment techniques must be employed to eliminate these contaminants from aquatic environments. Research on the relationship between the decomposing process of antibiotics and different factors by new technologies is scarce. This research focuses on the capability of ozone micro-nano bubbles (OzMNBs) to eliminate the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIPR) and levofloxacin (LEVO) in aqueous solutions. We studied the CIPR and LEVO decomposition to different variables through the central composite design method. The main variables included pH, ozonation time, and initial antibiotic concentration. The correlation coefficients of the quadratic model obtained by using the software, Design Expert version 13.0.1. Analysis of variances proved the significance of models and main factors. Verification tests also confirmed that the final optimum conditions of the antibiotics decomposition were: pH 9, ozonation for 40\u2005min and, initial antibiotic concentration of 5\u2005mg/L. In optimum conditions, removal rate of about 97% and 100% was obtained for CIPR and LEVO, respectively. The order of influence of various factors on CIPR and LEVO decomposition were obtained and the interactions between the main factors were also investigated. At the last stage of the research, the efficiency of OzMNBs in the removal of total organic carbon and mineralization of the solutions containing CIPR and LEVO under optimum conditions was examined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0661-6853"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Civil Engineering, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Iran."}], "LastName": "Babaee", "ForeName": "Yasser", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8874-0905"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Civil Engineering, Shahrood University of Technology, Shahrood, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saghravani", "ForeName": "Seyed Fazlolah", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1920-6781"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Safety and Quality Control, Research Institute of Food Science and Technology (RIFST), Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Feizy", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37729646", "10.1080/09593330.2023.2260123"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
