Here, we systematically explored the influence of NaCl salinity on the reaction and mass transfer of HCO through lab experiments, kinetic simulation, and computational fluid dynamics modeling, and proposed that the trade-off between reaction inhibition and mass transfer enhancement would affect the pollutants degradation pattern under varying salinity. The increase of NaCl salinity decreased ozone solubility and accelerated the futile consumption of ozone and hydroxyl radicals (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH), and the maximum <sup>\u2022</sup>OH concentration under 50 g/L salinity was only 23% of that without salinity. However, the increase of NaCl salinity also significantly reduced the ozone bubble size and enhanced the interphase and intraliquid mass transfer, with the volumetric mass transfer coefficient being 130% higher than that without salinity. The trade-off between reaction inhibition and mass transfer enhancement shifted under different pH values and aerator pore sizes, and the oxalate degradation pattern would change correspondingly. Besides, the trade-off was also identified for Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> salinity. These results emphasized the dual influence of salinity and offered a new theoretical perspective on the role of salinity in the HCO process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Kechao", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Tengfei", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ni", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4076-1464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3196-3443"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoyuan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37387610", "10.1021/acs.est.3c00595"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
