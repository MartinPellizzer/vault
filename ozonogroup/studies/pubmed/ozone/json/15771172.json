L. monocytogenes was sensitive to ozone (O3), chlorine, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Planktonic cells of strain Scott A were completely destroyed by exposure to 0.25 ppm O3 (8.29-log reduction, CFU per milliliter). Ozone's destruction of Scott A increased when the concentration was increased, with complete elimination at 4.00 ppm O3 (8.07-log reduction, CFU per chip). A 16-fold increase in sanitizer concentration was required to destroy biofilm cells of L. monocytogenes versus planktonic cells of strain Scott A. Strain 10403S required an ozone concentration of 1.00 ppm to eliminate planktonic cells (8.16-log reduction, CFU per milliliter). Attached cells of the same strain were eliminated at a concentration of 4.00 ppm O3 (7.47-log reduction, CFU per chip). At 100 ppm chlorine at 20 degrees C, the number of planktonic cells of L. monocytogenes 10403S was reduced by 5.77 log CFU/ml after 5 min of exposure and by 6.49 log CFU/ml after 10 min of exposure. Biofilm cells were reduced by 5.79 log CFU per chip following exposure to 100 ppm chlorine at 20 degrees C for 5 min, with complete elimination (6.27 log CFU per chip) after exposure to 150 ppm at 20 degrees C for 1 min. A 3% H2O2 solution reduced the initial concentration of L. monocytogenes Scott A planktonic cells by 6.0 log CFU/ml after 10 min of exposure at 20 degrees C, and a 3.5% H2O2 solution reduced the planktonic population by 5.4 and 8.7 log CFU/ml (complete elimination) after 5 and 10 min of exposure at 20 degrees C, respectively. Exposure of cells grown as biofilms to 5% H2O2 resulted in a 4.14-log CFU per chip reduction after 10 min of exposure at 20 degrees C and in a 5.58-log CFU per chip reduction (complete elimination) after 15 min of exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Illinois, 486 Animal Sciences Laboratory, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Robbins", "ForeName": "Justin B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fisher", "ForeName": "Christopher W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moltz", "ForeName": "Andrew G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "Scott E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Listeria monocytogenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15771172", "10.4315/0362-028x-68.3.494", "S0362-028X(22)00950-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
