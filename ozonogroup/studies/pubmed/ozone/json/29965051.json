used to treat petrochemical secondary effluent.The effect of FeSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b77H<sub>2</sub>O on COD and phosphorus removal by BAF-ozonation was studied.Molecular weight distribution,three-dimensional fluorescence scan and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to analyze water quality before and after BAF-ozonation.The results showed the average COD and TP concentrations were 82.91 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> and 1.37 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>,respectively.When the dosage of FeSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b77H<sub>2</sub>O was 9 mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>,the average removal rates of COD and TP were 52.20% and 71.50%,respectively.The average COD removal rate in number 1 combined process was 17.15%,which was higher than that in number 2 combined process.The TP removal rate in number 1 combined process was increased by 51.81%.The percentage of dissolved organic matters with relative molecular weight less than 1\u00d710<sup>3</sup> was 52% in the raw wastewater.However,the percentage increased to 75% when treated by number 1 combined process and the removal rate of various molecular weight organics was increased.Three-dimensional fluorescence analysis showed that the dosage of FeSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b77H<sub>2</sub>O could improve the removal of fluorescent substances.GC-MS results showed that the number and concentration of organics were reduced after number 1 combined process in comparison with number 2 combined process.BAF-ozone could be enhanced by FeSO<sub>4</sub>\u00b77H<sub>2</sub>O when treating petrochemical secondary effluent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Water Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."}, {"Identifier": [],
