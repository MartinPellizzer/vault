The effect of ozonation on the mutagenicity of mutagens and/or carcinogens of diverse chemical structures was evaluated as measured by the Salmonella/microsome assay. The effect of ozonation of 36 mutagens and/or carcinogens has been evaluated and the results of 15 reported here. The mutagenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines was inactivated by ozone treatment, while alkylating agents, nitro aromatics, and nitroso compounds were not affected. Ozonation of hydrazines produced mutagenic intermediates that may be susceptible to base-catalyzed hydrolysis. Therefore, depending on the chemical present, ozonation may be useful in the treatment of waters containing organic carcinogens, including drinking water, waste-water effluents, and other aqueous waste materials containing carcinogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burleson", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chambers", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "7909737", "ISSNLinking": "0192-2521"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7117216", "10.1002/em.2860040406"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
