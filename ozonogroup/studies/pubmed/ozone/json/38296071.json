This study uses ground observations and satellite retrievals to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of ground-level O<sub>3</sub> in Zhejiang Province, China. We created data-driven machine learning models that include meteorological, geographical and atmospheric parameters from multi-source remote sensing products, achieving good performance (Pearson's r of 0.81) in explaining regional O<sub>3</sub> dynamics. Analyses revealed the crucial roles of temperature, relative humidity, total column O<sub>3</sub>, and the distributions and interactions of precursor (volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides) in driving the varied O<sub>3</sub> patterns observed in Zhejiang. Furthermore, the interpretable modeling quantified multifactor interactions that sustain high O<sub>3</sub> levels in spring and autumn, suppress O<sub>3</sub> levels in summer, and inhibit O<sub>3</sub> formation in winter. This work demonstrates the value of a combined approach using satellite and machine learning as an effective novel tool for regional air quality assessment and control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
