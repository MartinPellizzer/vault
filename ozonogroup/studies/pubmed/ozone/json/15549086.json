Here we reconstruct the austral summer (December-January) Antarctic oscillation index from sea-level pressure measurements over the twentieth century and find that large positive values, and positive trends of a similar magnitude to those of past decades, also occurred around 1960, and that strong negative trends occurred afterwards. This positive Antarctic oscillation index and large positive trend during a period before ozone-depleting chemicals were released into the atmosphere and before marked anthropogenic warming, together with the later negative trend, indicate that natural forcing factors or internal mechanisms in the climate system must also strongly influence the state of the Antarctic oscillation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Coastal Research, GKSS Research Centre, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany. jones@gkss.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Julie M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Widmann", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nature", "NlmUniqueID": "0410462", "ISSNLinking": "0028-0836"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15549086", "10.1038/432290b", "432290b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
