The efficacy of ozonated water washing for inactivation of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium on green onions, grape tomatoes and green leaf lettuces were studied in our research. Surface inoculated fresh produce were washed by ozonated water for 1, 5, or 10 min at room temperature and pH 5.60 \u00b1 0.03. Then efficacy of ozonated water washing at mild heated (50 \u00b0C) and refrigerated (4 \u00b0C) temperature for 5 min with pH 5.60 \u00b1 0.03 was investigated. Salmonella inactivation efficacy under pH 5.60 \u00b1 0.03 and 2.64 \u00b1 0.02 with 5 min washing at room temperature were also compared. Our results showed that Salmonella inactivation by ozonated water was time-dependent for 3 fresh produce. Mild heated temperature (50 \u00b0C) and pH 2.64 \u00b1 0.02 improved efficacy of ozonated water to inactivate Salmonella on tomatoes and lettuces, but not on green onions. It is suggested that different surface structures of fresh produce significantly impact the antimicrobial efficacy of ozonated water washing operated under various parameters (time, temperature, and pH).", "Washing is the essential step for green onions and lettuces in the packinghouse and grape tomatoes in the restaurants and grocery stores having salad bars. Ozonated water can be used as disinfectant to reduce microbial contamination (FDA). The effectiveness of this disinfectant depends on the type of product and treatment conditions, such as water temperature, acidity, contact time. Our study showed that Salmonella inactivation by ozonated water washing was time-dependent. Mild heat and low pH improved inactivation efficacy on tomatoes and lettuces, but not on green onions. Processors should consider adjustments that are most appropriate for their produce."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Animal and Food Sciences, Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE, 19716-2150, U.S.A."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wenqing", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Changqing", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0014052", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24467482", "10.1111/1750-3841.12359"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
