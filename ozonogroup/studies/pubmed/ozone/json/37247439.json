We reported unexpected trends for the formation of chlorate and bromate in the solar/chlorine system. Excess chlorine inhibited the formation of bromate, i.e., increasing chlorine dosages from 50 to 100\u00a0\u03bcM reduced the bromate yield from 6.4 to 1.2\u00a0\u03bcM in solar/chlorine at 50\u00a0\u03bcM bromide and pH 7. The yield of bromate in solar/chlorine at 100\u00a0\u03bcM chlorine and 50\u00a0\u03bcM bromide in 240\u00a0min was 18.8% of that at 50\u00a0\u03bcM bromine only. The underlying mechanism was that HOCl can react with bromite (BrO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) to form HOClOBrO<sup>-</sup>, whose multi-step transformation finally formed chlorate as the major product and bromate as the minor product. This reaction overwhelmed the oxidation of bromite to form bromate by reactive species, such as <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, BrO<sup>\u2022</sup> and ozone. On the other hand, the presence of bromide greatly enhanced the formation of chlorate. Increasing bromide concentrations from 0 to 50\u00a0\u03bcM enhanced the chlorate yields from 2.2 to 7.0\u00a0\u03bcM at 100\u00a0\u03bcM chlorine. The absorbance of bromine was higher than that of chlorine, thus the photolysis of bromine formed higher levels of bromite at higher bromide concentrations. Then, bromite rapidly reacted with HOCl to form HOClOBrO<sup>-</sup> and it further transformed to chlorate. Additionally, 1\u00a0mg L<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> NOM had a negligible effect on bromate yields in solar/chlorine at 50\u00a0\u03bcM bromide, 100\u00a0\u03bcM chlorine and pH 7. This study demonstrated a new pathway of chlorate and bromate formation in the solar/chlorine system with bromide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
