A non-ionic surfactant, Brij 35, was selected. It was found that the presence of a low concentration of surfactant could improve the removal of ATZ by increasing the dissolution of ozone and the indirect generation of hydroxyl radicals. The saturated ozone level and the reaction rate constants were increased with increasing the concentration of surfactant and then decreased at higher surfactant doses at pH level of 2.5. A similar trend was observed at pH level of 7.0 in the presence of bicarbonate ion, because it is capable of deactivating the hydroxyl radicals generating at higher pH level. However, when the radical reactions become dominant in the ozonation (at pH 7.0 without bicarbonate), the saturated ozone level was higher than that with bicarbonate and the kinetic rate constants were increased first and levelled off with increasing of the dose of surfactant. Through the examining of a proposed unit performance index, the low concentration of surfactant is surely beneficial to the ozonation process. Besides, the direct photolysis and photo-assisted ozonation were compared to the ozonation. A significant enhancement on the decay rate of ATZ was resulted exclusively by adding the surfactant. An enhancement index for quantifying the improvement of the various processes was developed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Research Centre for Environmental Technology and Management, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hunghom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. cewchu@polyu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graham", "ForeName": "N J D", "Initials": "NJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJA9M5H4IM", "NameOfSubstance": "Atrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atrazine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16488463", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.01.028", "S0045-6535(06)00066-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
