Scarlett) 3 days prior to fumigation with injurious doses of ozone (150-250 ppb; 5 days; 7 h/day) induced a 50-60% protection against ozone injury on leaves. Fungicide treatments of barley plants at growth stage (GS) 32 significantly increased the total leaf soluble protein content. Additionally, activities of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate-peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were increased by both fungicides at maximal rates of 16, 75, 51 and 144%, respectively. Guiacol-peroxidase (POX) activity was elevated by 50-110% only in AZO treated plants, while this effect was lacking after treatments with EPO. This coincided with elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) only in EPO and not in AZO treated plants. The enhancement of the plant antioxidative system by the two fungicides significantly and considerably reduced the level of superoxide (O2*-) in leaves. Fumigation of barley plants for 4 days with non-injurious ozone doses (120-150 ppb, 7 h/day) markedly and immediately stimulated O2*- accumulation in leaves, while H2O2 was increased only after the third day of fumigation. Therefore, O2*- itself or as precursor of even more toxic oxyradicals appears to be more indicative for ozone-induced leaf damage than H2O2. Ozone also induced significant increases in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POX and CAT) after 2 days of fumigation in fungicide untreated plants, while after 4 days of fumigation these enzymes declined to a level lower than in unfumigated plants, due to the oxidative degradation of leaf proteins. This is the first report demonstrating the marked enhancement of plant antioxidative enzymes and the enhanced scavenging of potentially harmful O2*- by fungicides as a mechanism of protecting plants against noxious oxidative stress from the environment. The antioxidant effect of modern fungicides widely used in intense cereal production in many countries represents an important factor when evaluating potential air pollution effects in agriculture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytomedicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Rostock, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yue-xuan", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von", "ForeName": "Tiedemann Andreas", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methacrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrimidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Strobilurins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NYH7Y08IPM", "NameOfSubstance": "azoxystrobin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U80T84L776", "NameOfSubstance": "epoxiconazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acrylates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hordeum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methacrylates"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrimidines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Strobilurins"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Triazoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11808554", "10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00174-9", "S0269-7491(01)00174-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
