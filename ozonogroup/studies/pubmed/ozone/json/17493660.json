Results obtained showed that photodegradation with UV radiation (254 nm) of 1-naphthalenesulfonic, 1,5-naphthalendisulfonic and 1,3,6-naphthalentrisulfonic acids is not effective. Presence of duroquinone and 4-carboxybenzophenone during UV irradiation (308-410 nm) of the naphthalenesulfonic acids increased the photodegradation rate. Addition of H(2)O(2) during irradiation of naphthalenesulfonic acids accelerated their elimination, due to the generation of ()OH radicals in the medium. Comparison between UV photodegradation 254 m and the advanced oxidation processes (O(3), O(3)/activated carbon and UV/H(2)O(2)) showed the low-efficacy of the former in the degradation of these compounds from aqueous medium. Thus, among the systems studied, those based on the use of UV/H(2)O(2) and O(3)/activated carbon were the most effective in the oxidation of these contaminants from the medium. This is because of the high-reactivity of naphthalenesulfonic acids with the *OH radicals generated by these two systems. This was confirmed by the values of the reaction rate constant of *OH radicals with these compounds k(OH), obtained by competitive kinetics (5.7 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1), 5.2 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and 3.7 x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) for NS, NDS and NTS, respectively)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica, Campus Fuentenueva s/n, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Polo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rivera-Utrilla", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00e9ndez-D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Canonica", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "von Gunten", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17493660", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.03.050", "S0045-6535(07)00427-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
