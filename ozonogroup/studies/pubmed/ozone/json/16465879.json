The results indicated that the decomposition of p-nitrophenol was accelerated as the gas flow rate or pH value increased. When gaseous ozone concentration was 20.11 mg/L and pH was 3, after 24 min reaction, the removal rate of p-nitrophenol reached 73.04%, 86.11%, 91.71% and 95% at the gas flow rate of 32, 40, 48 and 56 ml/min respectively. And when pH was 3, 4, 5, 6, the decomposition rate was 66.38%, 82.09%, 90.46%, 97.50% after a 20 min reaction respectively. It was mainly O3 molecule that took part in the decomposition when pH was 3. The main intermediates during the decomposition include catechol, o-benzoquinone, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, phenol, fumaric acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid and formic acid. The decomposition mechanism of p-nitrophenol was also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hui-xiang", "Initials": "HX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xian-wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xin-hu", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Da-hui", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qi-da", "Initials": "QD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrophenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16465879"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
