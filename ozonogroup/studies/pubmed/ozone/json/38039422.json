However, the impact of maternal air pollution exposure on twin growth discordance has rarely been investigated. We examined the association of long-term ozone exposure during preconception and pregnancy with the birth weight of twins and twin growth discordance among 35,795 twins from the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project between January 2010 and December 2019. Linear mixed-effect models and random-effect logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of ozone exposure with the birth weight-related outcomes (i.e., birth weight of twins and within-pair birth weight difference) and risk of twin growth discordance, respectively, after adjustment for demographic characteristics and lifestyle. We found that an interquartile range (IQR) increase (15 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>) in ozone exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with a reduction (-28.96g, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -46.37, -11.56) in the total birth weight of twins, and ozone had a more pronounced impact on the birth weight of the smaller fetuses (-18.28 g, 95% CI: -27.22, -9.34) compared to the larger fetuses (-9.88 g, 95% CI: -18.84, -0.92) in twin pregnancies. An IQR increase in ozone exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with a significant increase (8.41 g, 95% CI: 4.13, 12.69) in the within-pair birth weight difference; the odds ratio (OR) of twin growth discordance related to ozone exposure increased by 9% (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.18). However, no consistently significant associations were observed for ozone exposure during prepregnancy. Male-male twin pairs and those who were born prematurely appeared to be more susceptible to ozone exposure than their counterparts. Long-term ozone exposure during pregnancy was associated with twin growth discordance, and our findings provide reference data for future studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
