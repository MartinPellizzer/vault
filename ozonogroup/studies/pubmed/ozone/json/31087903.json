The results showed that during this photochemical pollution process, the average O<sub>3</sub> and PAN concentrations were relatively high:O<sub>3,max</sub> 1 h concentration was 140.6\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> and PAN<sub>max</sub> 1 h concentration was 4.7\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. The average concentration of NO was low, which had little effect on O<sub>3</sub> titration and PAN elimination. The high NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, strong radiation, and low wind speed all led to the formulation and accumulation of O<sub>3</sub> and PAN. The linear relationship between O<sub>3</sub> and PAN (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.55) was affected by the fact that their precursor VOCs were not similar. Ethene, propane, isoprene, and toluene had a large influence in PAN formation, while isoprene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, propene, <i>m,p</i>-xylene, and toluene had a large influence on O<sub>3</sub> formation potential. When evaluating PA concentration, we found that its daily average concentration ranged from 0.11\u00d710<sup>-12</sup> to 0.16\u00d710<sup>-12</sup>, which were higher than many places around the world, indicating that this photochemical process was relatively intensive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Guangzhou 510080, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Guangzhou 510080, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Xue-Jiao", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Guangzhou 510080, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Guangzhou 510080, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Chang-Qin", "Initials": "CQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31087903", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201807201"]}}]}
