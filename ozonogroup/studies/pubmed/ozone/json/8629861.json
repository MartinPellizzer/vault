The rate of taking sick leave was related to the concentrations of sulfate and ozone in ambient air, the air temperature, and the relative humidity. The incidence of absenteeism was treated as a Poisson process, with the size of population at risk as the offset factor and with the environmental monitoring data as hazard factors. There appeared to be some overdispersion; therefore, in a second analysis the incidence of absenteeism was also treated as a negative binomial outcome. With the exception of a separate overdispersion parameter in the negative binomial approach, both methods yielded approximately the same results. Although no significant association was found between absence rate and the measured ambient-air-quality data, there appeared to be a time lag of 3 d between a peak in temperature and 1 d in absenteeism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Occupational Health & Safety Service RBB, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moll Van Charante", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mulder", "ForeName": "P G", "Initials": "PG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0212627", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9896"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absenteeism"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Forestry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Netherlands"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workforce"}], "NumberOfReferences": "39"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8629861", "10.1080/00039896.1996.9935991"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
