Data obtained from epidemiological studies are inconsistent and controversial. The aim of this case-crossover study was to examine the association between short-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> alone and in combination with other pollutants and frequency of hospitalizations for depression from 2009 to 2013 in Taipei, Taiwan. In the single pollutant model without adjustment for other pollutants, 17% and 4% increase in admissions attributed to depression correlated with interquartile range (IQR) rise in PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels was noted on warm and cool days, respectively. Data were also analyzed using two-pollutant models and it was found that on warm days, the association continued to be significant after including one of the following pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO). On cool days, the significance was lost. In conclusion, the relationship between ambient outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and rates of hospitalization for depression appeared to be temperature dependent in Taipei. Further research is needed to verify these observations as well as to distinguish the relative contributions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and temperature to development for hospital admissions for depression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Healthcare Administration, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Shang-Shyue", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Master Program in Global Health and Development, College of Public, Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Ya-Wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung, Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwwan."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Yi-Hao", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Health Research Institute, Miaoli, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yuh", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Hospitalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34058967", "10.1080/15287394.2021.1932652"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
