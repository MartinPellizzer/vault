The initial products are two ozonide monoadducts, identified as a,b- and c,c-C(70)O(3). These ozonides lose O(2) through thermolysis or photolysis to form various isomers of C(70)O. The a,b-C(70)O(3) isomer dissociates through thermolysis with a decay time of 14 min at 296 K to form the [6,6]-closed epoxide a,b-C(70)O. When photolyzed, it instead forms a [5,6]-open oxidoannulene identified as a,a-C(70)O. These reactions mimic those seen for C(60)O(3). By contrast, the c,c-C(70)O(3) isomer, which has a thermolysis lifetime of 650 min at 296 K, decays thermally only to an oxidoannulene deduced to be d,d-C(70)O. Photolysis of c,c-C(70)O(3) produces a mixture of the oxidoannulenes b,c-C(70)O and c,d-C(70)O plus a minor amount of the c,c-epoxide. All four C(70)O oxidoannulene isomers undergo photoisomerization, giving eventually the a,b- and c,c-C(70)O epoxides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Science, Rice Quantum Institute, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77251, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heymann", "ForeName": "Dieter", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bachilo", "ForeName": "Sergei M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weisman", "ForeName": "R Bruce", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12033860", "10.1021/ja012488p", "ja012488p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
