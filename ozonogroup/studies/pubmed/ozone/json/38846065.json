Although advanced age and chronic disease are factors that may exacerbate a person's negative response to ozone exposure, there are no molecular biomarkers of susceptibility. Here, we examine whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) is associated with responsiveness to short-term ozone exposure. Using data from a crossover-controlled exposure study (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200917), we examined whether EAA, as measured in lung epithelial cells collected 24\u2009h after clean air exposure, modifies the observed effect of ozone on autonomic function, cardiac electrophysiology, hemostasis, pulmonary function, and inflammation. EAA was assessed in lung epithelial cells extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, using the pan-tissue aging clock. We used two analytic approaches: (i) median regression to estimate the association between EAA and the estimated risk difference for subclinical responses to ozone and (ii) a block randomization approach to estimate EAA's effect modification of subclinical responses. For both approaches, we calculated Fisher-exact <i>P</i>-values, allowing us to bypass large sample size assumptions. In median regression analyses, accelerated epigenetic age modified associations between ozone and heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) ([Formula: see text]= 0.12, <i>P</i>-value\u2009=\u20090.007) and between ozone and C-reactive protein ([Formula: see text]\u2009=\u2009-0.18, <i>P</i>\u2009=\u20090.069). During block randomization, the directions of association remained consistent for QTc and C-reactive protein; however, the <i>P</i>-values weakened. Block randomization also revealed that responsiveness of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to ozone exposure was modified by accelerated epigenetic aging (PAI-1 difference between accelerated aging-defined block groups\u2009=\u2009-0.54, <i>P</i>-value\u2009=\u20090.039). In conclusion, EAA is a potential biomarker for individuals with increased susceptibility to ozone exposure even among young, healthy adults."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Oxford University Press 2024.
