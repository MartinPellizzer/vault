The oxidation reactions of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are considerably different in marine waters from well-known drinking, process and wastewater applications. In contrast, the major secondary oxidants are bromine species in marine waters, which might form the DBPs of concern bromate and bromoform. An efficient AOP application needs knowledge of the source water constitutions and the oxidant demand. Besides changes in the oxidants chemistry compared to fresh water, the great and seasonal variation of marine waters has to be considered in the process design. The complexity of oxidant reactions and formation of byproducts are only partially researched and known as yet. Hence, it is advisable to determine the characteristic and variation of the water source as well as its influence on each AOP in experiments prior to the process design."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ELGA Berkefeld GmbH, Research & Development, Lueckenweg 5, Celle 29227, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kornmueller", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Corrosion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oceans and Seas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}], "NumberOfReferences": "16"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17674819", "10.2166/wst.2007.379"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
