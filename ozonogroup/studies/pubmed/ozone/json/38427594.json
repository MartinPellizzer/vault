Applauded as one of the most effective environmental agreements to date, the universally accepted Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances has had a significant impact on the environment, reducing the release of halogenated compounds from anthropogenic sources enough to mitigate global warming by an estimated 1.1\u00b0C by 2021. The funding associated with various MeBr transition programs has increased collaboration across scientific disciplines, commodity groups, industry, and regulatory agencies. Chemical alternatives and improved application strategies, including the development of gas-retentive agricultural films, coupled with sound efficacy data and grower ingenuity have resulted in the sustained production of many of the impacted crops; although there has been some loss of acreage and value, particularly for Florida fumigated crops, for some, value has continued to increase, allowing production to continue. The loss of a single, broad-spectrum tool for pest control has led to a deeper understanding of the specific pest complexes impacting these at-risk crops, as well as the development of new, biologically based management tools for their control while increasing our understanding of the role of the soil microbiome in pest control and crop production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9377-3798"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory, Fort Pierce, FL 34945."}], "LastName": "Rosskopf", "ForeName": "Erin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Science, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802."}], "LastName": "Gioia", "ForeName": "Francesco Di", "Initials": "FD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611."}], "LastName": "Vincent", "ForeName": "Isaac", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory, Fort Pierce, FL 34945."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Jason", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Phytopathology", "NlmUniqueID": "9427222", "ISSNLinking": "0031-949X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9V42E1Z7B6", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl bromide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Brominated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}], "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38427594", "10.1094/PHYTO-09-23-0345-IA"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
