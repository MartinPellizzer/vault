The first experiment measured the responding of food-deprived rats working to obtain intermittent delivery of small pellets of food by completing an active response, wheel running. Low O3 concentrations (0.12 ppm) reduced the frequency of running responses maintained by this fixed-interval 10-min schedule of food delivery. The second experiment examined the effects of O2 on food-deprived rats performing a response (nose poking) that required minimal physical effort to produce deliveries of food pellets. Rats in this situation began to show reductions in responding at 0.5 ppm O3. A third experiment showed that responses requiring minimal physical effort, such as lever pressing, can be a sensitive index of O3 exposure if the response provides access to wheel running. We concluded that increased physical activity during exposure appeared to be an important variable in determining sensitivity to O3 exposure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tepper", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weiss", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES-02147", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conditioning, Operant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Deprivation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3957838", "10.1152/jappl.1986.60.3.868"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
