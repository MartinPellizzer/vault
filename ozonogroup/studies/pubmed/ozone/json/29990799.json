Ozonation, performed with the use of ceramic membrane contactor, was able to diminish CBZ concentration below 0.1\u202f\u03bcM at 0.4\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC, i.e. presenting >90% removal rate, whereas the transformation of BZT, pCBA and ATZ was not exceeded 70%, 57% and 49%, respectively, under the same experimental conditions. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduced the removal efficiency of CBZ, since up to -8% transformation values were observed at 0.1\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC. In contrast, the transformation of ozone-resistant compounds pCBA and ATZ was slightly improved by approximately 5-10%, at 0.8\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC. Membrane-based oxidative treatment of surface water resulted to high bromate concentrations (49\u202f\u03bcg/L and 28\u202f\u03bcg/L for ozone and peroxone process, respectively, at 0.8\u202fmg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC). The results obtained by using the membrane contactor were also compared with the corresponding from conventional batch experiments. These results suggest that the implementation of membrane contactors with the highest possible inner surface per volume along with the use of low ozone gas concentration are required to improve the removal of micropollutants and diminish bromate formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
