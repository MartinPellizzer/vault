Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations can be monitored from satellites, but most retrieval methods retrieve PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> separately and disregard the shared information between the two air pollutants, for example due to common emission sources. Using surface observations across China spanning 2014-2021, we found a strong relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Thus, in this study, we propose a new deep learning model called the Simultaneous Ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> inversion deep neural Network (SOPiNet), which allows for daily real-time monitoring and full coverage of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> simultaneously at a spatial resolution of 5\u00a0km. SOPiNet employs the multi-head attention mechanism to better capture the temporal variations in PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> based on previous days' conditions. Applying SOPiNet to MODIS data over China in 2022, using 2019-2021 to construct the network, we found that simultaneous retrievals of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> improved the performance compared with retrieving them independently: the temporal R<sup>2</sup> increased from 0.66 to 0.72 for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and from 0.79 to 0.82 for O<sub>3</sub>. The results suggest that near-real time satellite-based air quality monitoring can be improved by simultaneous retrieval of different but related pollutants.
