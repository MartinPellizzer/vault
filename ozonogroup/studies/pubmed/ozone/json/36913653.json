Nevertheless, the potential neurotoxicity of 6-PPDQ after long-term exposure and the underlying mechanism are largely unclear. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we here observed that 0.1-10 \u03bcg/L of 6-PPDQ caused several forms of abnormal locomotion behaviors. Meanwhile, the neurodegeneration of D-type motor neurons was observed in 10 \u03bcg/L of 6-PPDQ-exposed nematodes. The observed neurodegeneration was associated with the activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel DEG-3-mediated signaling cascade. In this signaling cascade, expressions of <i>deg-3</i>, <i>unc-68</i>, <i>itr-1</i>, <i>crt-1</i>, <i>clp-1</i>, and <i>tra-3</i> were increased by 10 \u03bcg/L of 6-PPDQ. Moreover, among genes encoding neuronal signals required for the control of stress response, expressions of <i>jnk-1</i> and <i>dbl-1</i> were decreased by 0.1-10 \u03bcg/L of 6-PPDQ, and expressions of <i>daf-7</i> and <i>glb-10</i> were decreased by 10 \u03bcg/L of 6-PPDQ. RNAi of <i>jnk-1</i>, <i>dbl-1</i>, <i>daf-7</i>, and <i>glb-10</i> resulted in the susceptibility to 6-PPDQ toxicity in decreasing locomotory ability and in inducing neurodegeneration, suggesting that JNK-1, DBL-1, DAF-7, and GLB-10 were also required for the induction of 6-PPDQ neurotoxicity. Molecular docking analysis further demonstrated the binding potential of 6-PPDQ to DEG-3, JNK-1, DBL-1, DAF-7, and GLB-10. Together, our data suggested the exposure risk of 6-PPDQ at environmentally relevant concentrations in causing neurotoxicity in organisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of Ministry of Education, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of Ministry of Education, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Geyu", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7800-3557"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of Ministry of Education, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4656-7427"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering of Ministry of Education, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dayong", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylenediamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoquinones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Locomotion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylenediamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Neurons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36913653", "10.1021/acs.est.2c08644"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
