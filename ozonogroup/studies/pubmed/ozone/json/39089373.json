This study investigated the combined effects of anthropogenic and biogenic emission on O<sub>3</sub> formation in the Guanzhong Basin (GZB), Central China, providing useful information into the mechanisms of O<sub>3</sub> formation due to the interaction between anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A severe O<sub>3</sub> pollution episode in summer of 2017 was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine the impacts of ambient HCHO on ground-level O<sub>3</sub>. Results showed secondary HCHO dominated ambient levels, peaking in the afternoon (up to 86\u00a0%), while primary emissions contributed 14\u00a0% on average. This enhanced O<sub>3</sub> production by 7.7\u00a0% during the morning rush hour and 24.3\u00a0% in the afternoon. In addition, HCHO concentration peaked before that of O<sub>3</sub>, suggesting it plays significant role in O<sub>3</sub> formation. Biogenic emission oxidation contributed 3.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> (53.1\u00a0%) of HCHO and 5.2 pptv (40.1\u00a0%) of hydroperoxyl radicals (HO<sub>2</sub>) in average urban areas, where the downwind regions of the forests had high nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) levels and favorable conditions for O<sub>3</sub> production (17.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>, 20.5\u00a0%). In forested regions, sustained isoprene oxidation led to elevated oxidized VOCs including HCHO and acetaldehyde downwind, which practiced further photolysis of O<sub>3</sub> formation with anthropogenic NO<sub>x</sub> in urban areas. Sensitivity experiments recommend controlling industrial and traffic NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, with regional joint prevention and regulation, which are essential to reduce O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
