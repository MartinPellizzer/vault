The method combines conventional aspects of analysis with an image intensification system that records the spatial distribution of delayed light emission (DLE) over single leaf surfaces. The combined system was used to investigate physiological perturbations induced by exposure of single leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris cv ;California Light Red' to a combination of SO(2) (0.5 microliters per liter) and ozone (0.1 microliters per liter). Exposure of one-half of a leaf to this combination induced DLE and stomatal oscillations, but only in the half of the leaf exposed to the combined gases. Examination of phytoluminographs taken during these oscillations revealed distinct leaf patches where the greatest changes in DLE intensity occurred. This phenomenon is interpreted to be evidence that control of stomatal activity of intact plant leaves occurs within discrete leaf areas defined within the vascular network."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ellenson", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raba", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Jul 25;227(5256):377-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5428432"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1966 Jul 22;153(3734):424-5", "ArticleIdList": ["17839715"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1963 May;38(3):298-304", "ArticleIdList": ["16655788"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Jan 31;225(5231):476", "ArticleIdList": ["5411127"]}, {"Citation": "J Gen Physiol. 1951 Jul;34(6):809-20", "ArticleIdList": ["14850702"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1982 Feb 26;215(4536):1104-6", "ArticleIdList": ["17771843"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1977 Dec;60(6):822-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16660193"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1975 Apr;55(4):589-93", "ArticleIdList": ["16659130"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1974 Nov;54(5):769-72", "ArticleIdList": ["16658969"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16662989", "PMC1066175", "10.1104/pp.72.1.90"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
