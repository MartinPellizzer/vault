The daily attendance rate of children with acute wheeze at the accident and emergency department of Lewisham Hospital was related to local measurements of ozone, hydrocarbon species, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and small particulate matter with diameter < 10 microns (PM10).", "An inverse relation was found between the air pollutants and ozone. After seasonal and meteorological adjustment a non-linear U shaped trend was found between incidence of wheeze and ozone. The trend was significant in children < 2 years of age but not in older children. In the younger age group, after adjustment for season, temperature, wind speed, and respiratory infection, the incidence relative to that at the mean daily ozone concentration of 32.7 micrograms/m3, was estimated to increase by 65% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 22% to 122%) at an ozone concentration of 5 micrograms/m3 (1.5 SDs below the mean) and by 63% (95% CI -6% to 184%) at 80 micrograms/m3 (2.5 SDs above the mean). For several hydrocarbons there were significant positive linear relations found, again in children < 2 years of age but not older children. For benzene, the incidence increased by 8% (95% CI 2 to 13%) per SD (SD 2.8 micrograms/m3) increase in benzene concentration. A same day association between incidence and ozone was found to be the most significant but for other pollutants a lag of 2 days gave the most significant associations. No significant association was found for the non-hydrocarbon pollutants including SO2, NO2, and PM10.", "A U shaped relation was found between ozone and the incidence of wheezy episodes in young children. Certain hydrocarbon pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere when ozone concentrations are low, and are associated with childhood wheezy episodes. However, the U shaped association of ozone on incidence cannot be explained by these other pollutants. The finding supports an earlier finding that incidences of wheeze are at a minimum when ozone concentrations are 30-40 micrograms/m3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, London, UK. rbuc@easynet.co.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buchdahl", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Willems", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vander", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Babiker", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Occup Environ Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9422759", "ISSNLinking": "1351-0711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Sounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Pediatr. 1973 Apr;82(4):578-90", "ArticleIdList": ["4349062"]}, {"Citation": "Stat Med. 1989 May;8(5):551-61", "ArticleIdList": ["2657958"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1990 Feb;51(1):51-70", "ArticleIdList": ["2298182"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1991 Aug;55(2):107-22", "ArticleIdList": ["1868814"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1992 Aug;58(2):184-94", "ArticleIdList": ["1511672"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1999 Jul;54(7):597-605", "ArticleIdList": ["10377204"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 1996 Mar 16;312(7032):661-5", "ArticleIdList": ["8597731"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1997 Nov;52(11):946-52", "ArticleIdList": ["9487341"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1997 Nov;52(11):958-63", "ArticleIdList": ["9487343"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1998 Mar;53(3):204-12", "ArticleIdList": ["9659358"]}, {"Citation": "Thorax. 1998 Oct;53(10):842-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10193370"]}, {"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 1995 Jan 19;332(3):133-8", "ArticleIdList": ["7800004"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10711275", "PMC1739904", "10.1136/oem.57.2.86"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
