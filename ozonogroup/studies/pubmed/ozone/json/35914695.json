Specimens were allocated randomly into five groups (n\u00a0=\u00a010) as per the type of CAD disinfectants. KTP laser, OW, RBP, CHX (control), and Er, YAG laser. After cavity sanitization, a resin adhesive (prime and bond NT) was smeared on the dentinal exterior followed by incremental composite filling. SBS evaluation was performed by employing specimens in the universal testing machine. The debonded surface was assessed under 40x magnification in a stereomicroscope to ascertain fracture mode. Statistical analysis was done by using the ANOVA and the Post Hoc Tukey multiple comparison tests (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "The highest SBS was exhibited by group 2 i.e., when OW was employed for CAD disinfection (10.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0MPa). Whereas, the lowest SBS bond value was unveiled by samples in group 3 when RBP was applied for dentin surface sanitization (7.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59\u00a0MPa).CAD disinfection with KTP laser (8.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41\u00a0MPa), CHX (8.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73\u00a0MPa), and RBP displayed comparable bond values (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).", "Ozonated water and Er, YAG laser could be employed as cavity disinfectants in primary teeth as they demonstrated better shear bond strength without jeopardizing the adhesive binding capacity of restorative resins bonded to caries-affected dentin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
