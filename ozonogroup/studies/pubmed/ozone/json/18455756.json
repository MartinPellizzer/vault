Observation analysis reveals that the urban plume is transported by a southerly wind and undergoes chemical reaction during propagation, resulting in the common occurrence of high O(3) concentrations in the urban downwind area; this is the typical scenario of the formation of high summertime O(3) levels over the Beijing area. The typical high-O(3) episode is well reproduced by the 3-dimensional air-quality model CMAQ-MADRID (Community Multi-scale Air-Quality Model of Aerosol Dynamics, Reaction, Ionization, and Dissolution). Radical cycle analysis reveals that the Beijing urban area was in a VOC-limited regime for O(3) formation, while the urban downwind area changed gradually to a NO(x)-limited condition. The urban downwind area, Dingling, is readily affected by intrusion of the urban plume. Detailed process analysis indicated that although the O(3) peaks reached the same level on 26 and 27 June 2000, the dominant process contributing to the O(3) increase was different on each day. On 26 June, the major contributor to the O(3) peak at Dingling was the arrival of high O(3) levels with propagation of the urban plume; in contrast, on 27 June O(3) precursors were transported rapidly to the urban downwind area by strong transportation processes that occurred earlier than those on the previous day, resulting in O(3) production by local photochemistry becoming the major contributor to the high-O(3) episode."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing, 100012, China. xujun@craes.org.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuanhang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Joshua S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Shaoqing", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Movements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weather"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18455756", "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.013", "S0048-9697(08)00147-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
