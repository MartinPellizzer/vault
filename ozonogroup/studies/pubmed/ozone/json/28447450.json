The effects of ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) treatment of the GaN surface on the energy band bending of atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coated Ga-polar GaN were studied. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment and post-ALD anneal can be used to effectively vary the band bending, the valence band offset, conduction band offset, and the interface dipole at the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/GaN interfaces. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment increases the surface energy of the Ga-polar GaN, improves the uniformity of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> deposition, and changes the amount of trapped charges in the ALD layer. The positively charged surface states formed by the UV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment-induced surface factors externally screen the effect of polarization charges in the GaN, in effect, determining the eventual energy band bending at the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/GaN interfaces. An optimal UV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment condition also exists for realizing the \"best\" interface conditions. The study of UV/O<sub>3</sub> treatment effect on the band alignments at the dielectric/III-nitride interfaces will be valuable for applications of transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6942-7481"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kwangeun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2757-9457"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Jae Ha", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jisoo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Sang June", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jeongpil", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison , 1415 Engineering Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "In-Kyu", "Initials": "IK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HexaTech, Inc. , 991 Aviation Parkway, Morrisville, North Carolina 27560, United States."}], "LastName": "Moody", "ForeName": "Baxter", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington , 701 S.
