To identify the vegetation-driven offset between the deposition and formation of air pollutants, this study examines the responses of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations to changes in the leaf area index (LAI) over East Asia and its neighboring seas, using up-to-date satellite-derived LAI and green vegetation fraction (GVF) products. Two LAI scenarios that examine (1) table-prescribed LAI and GVF from 1992 to 1993 AVHRR and 2001 MODIS products and (2) reprocessed 2019 MODIS LAI and 2019 VIIRS GVF products were used in WRF-CMAQ modeling to simulate ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations for June 2019. The use of up-to-date LAI and GVF products resulted in monthly mean LAI differences ranging from -56.20% to 96.81% over the study domain. The increase in LAI resulted in the differences in hourly mean ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over inland areas ranging from 0.27 ppbV to -7.17 ppbV and 0.89\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> to -2.65\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, and the differences of those over the adjacent sea surface ranging from 0.69 ppbV to -2.86 ppbV and 3.41\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> to -7.47\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>. The decreases in inland ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were mainly the results of dry deposition accelerated by increases in LAI, which outweighed the ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> formations via BVOC-driven chemistry. Some inland regions showed further decreases in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations due to reduced reactions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> precursors with hydroxyl radicals depleted by BVOCs. The reductions in sea surface ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were accompanied by the reductions in those in upwind inland regions, which led to less ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> inflows. The results suggest the importance of the selective use of vegetation parameters for air quality modeling."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
