As effective and efficient approaches for water purification, Fenton's reagent, ozonation, electrochemical and photocatalytic methods have been widely studied and applied in different aspects and have been reviewed by several articles. In recent years, some novel catalytic processes based on above processes have been developed for enhancing the efficiency of removing the organics from water. This review emphasized on the recent development of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, electrocatalysis in respect of novel electrodes and electro-Fenton method, photoelectrocatalysis process and photoelectron-Fenton in water purification. It was also an attempt to propose general ideas about mechanism and principle enhancing the catalytic efficiency for the degradation and the mineralization of organics in water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Natural Science Foundation of China, Beijing 100085, China. lidp@mail.nsfc.gov.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dapeng", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Jiuhui", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenton's reagent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}], "NumberOfReferences": "51"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19803071", "10.1016/s1001-0742(08)62329-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
