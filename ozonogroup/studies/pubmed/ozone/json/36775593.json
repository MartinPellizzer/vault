The results showed that the average concentration of VOCs was (22.22\u00b110.10)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, with the largest contribution of VOCs from alkanes (55.65%), followed by that of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) (16.23%) and alkenes (8.13%). Three ozone pollution episodes were captured during the observation period. The average concentration of VOCs on pollution days was (26.22\u00b112.52)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>, which was 60.17%higher than that on clear days (16.37\u00b17.19)\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. The value of ozone formation potential (OFP) on pollution days was 113.63 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, which was 56.55%higher than that on clear days. The contributions of OVOCs and aromatics to OFP on pollution days increased by 6.51%and 1.55%, respectively, whereas that of alkenes declined (8.72%). The ratios of toluene to benzene (T/B) and benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene (B:T:E) were 1.55 and 0.36:0.55:0.09, respectively, indicating that vehicle exhaust had significant effects on VOCs in autumn in urban Beijing. The back-trajectory results indicated a high contribution of southern air masses to atmospheric VOCs variations in autumn in urban Beijing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, National Engineering Research Center of Urban Environmental Pollution Control, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xue-Song", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, National Engineering Research Center of Urban Environmental Pollution Control, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, National Engineering Research Center of Urban Environmental Pollution Control, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds Pollution Control and Application, National Engineering Research Center of Urban Environmental Pollution Control, Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Eco-Environmental Protection, Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Teng", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36775593", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202203008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
