This review was performed according to the PICO format. The eligibility criteria comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that analyzed the adjunctive effect of OT on nonsurgical periodontal treatment.", "Twelve studies published between 2010 and 2019 were included in this SR. A metaanalysis of ten reports showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the periodontal parameters analyzed when scaling and root planing (SRP) plus sulcus irrigation with ozonated water or sulcus insertion of ozonated gas were used when compared to SRP alone. Additionally, there was no significant difference when the effect of SRP plus ozonated water was compared with SRP plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CLX). No studies reported significant microbiological differences when the use of ozone was compared with SRP alone.", "The results of this SR do not support the use of OT for nonsurgical periodontal treatment. However, due to the potential heterogeneity across the studies, the presence of confounding factors, and the short follow-up of some included RCTs, these results should not be considered definitive.", "The current evidence indicates that ozone has antimicrobial activity and good biocompatibility with periodontal cells and gingival fibroblasts. However, no evidence was found for a positive effect of OT as an adjunct to scaling and root planing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Dental Research Division, School of Dentistry, Veiga de Almeida University, Rua Ibituruna, 108, Maracan\u00e3, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. vitt.mf@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Moraschini", "ForeName": "Vittorio", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Surgery, Dentistry School, Fluminense Federal University, Rua Mario dos Santos Braga, 30, Centro, Niter\u00f3i, Rio de Janeiro, 24020-140, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Kischinhevsky", "ForeName": "Ingrid Chaves Cavalcante", "Initials": "ICC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Surgery, Dentistry School, Fluminense Federal University, Rua Mario dos Santos Braga, 30, Centro, Niter\u00f3i, Rio de Janeiro, 24020-140, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Calasans-Maia", "ForeName": "Monica Diuana", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Dental Research Division, University of Guarulhos, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Shibli", "ForeName": "Jamil Awad", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Dental Research Division, School of Dentistry, Veiga de Almeida University, Rua Ibituruna, 108, Maracan\u00e3, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Sartoretto", "ForeName": "Suelen Cristina", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Figueredo", "ForeName": "Carlos Marcelo", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dental Technics, School of Dentistry, Fluminense Federal University, Niter\u00f3i, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (INMETRO), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Granjeiro", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Mauro", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "202619/17", "Agency": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Clin Oral Investig", "NlmUniqueID": "9707115", "ISSNLinking": "1432-6981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Scaling"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Root Planing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32399735", "10.1007/s00784-020-03289-2", "10.1007/s00784-020-03289-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
