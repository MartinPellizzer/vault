Limiting-case calculations were performed to determine the significance of convective mucus transport and chemical reaction for formaldehyde (HCHO) and ozone (O(3)) in rat nasal respiratory epithelial mucus. Less than 4.6% of absorbed HCHO can be bound to amino groups (serum albumin) after 20 min of exposure. Thus, at the slowest measured mucus flow rates in rats, approximately 1 mm/min, a fluid element of mucus could travel more than 2 cm before binding 5% of absorbed HCHO, by which time the element would probably leave the nose (the site of toxic responses). In other calculations, HCHO removed by chemical reaction from a volume of mucus exposed for longer times was determined to be less than 0.54% of that removed by mucus flow (convection). Given the solubility of HCHO in mucus (water) and estimates of total mucus flow, however, as much as 22-42% of inhaled HCHO may be removed by total mucus flow. Alternately, O(3) dissolved in mucus would react completely with unsaturated fatty acids in 8.3 x 10(-4) s, in which time the mucus could flow no more than approximately 0.42 microm at the maximum reported flow rate of 30 mm/min. Even if a volume of mucus is flushed by net flow in 1 s, the amount of O(3) removed by flow would only be 0.12% of that removed by chemical reaction. Finally, based on the solubility of ozone, less than 8.0 x 10(-5)% of inhaled material could be removed from the nose by mucus flow. These results indicate which mucociliary processes are significant in site-specific dosimetry modeling."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, PO Box 12137, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA. schlosser@ciit.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schlosser", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Inhal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8910739", "ISSNLinking": "0895-8378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Convection"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mucus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10509029", "10.1080/089583799196736"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
