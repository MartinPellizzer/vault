MgO/GAC-1 was also compared in stability to the same catalyst prepared via precipitation according to the literature (MgO/GAC-2). The results showed that MgO/GAC-1 could increase efficiency of ozonation by 15%-35% in the process of degradation of diuron and acetic acid. When the pH of the solution was neutral or alkaline, MgO/GAC-1 could effectively retard the decrease in pH owing to formation of small molecular organic acids, thus ensuring the efficiency of ozone. When the pH of the solution was acidic, MgO/GAC-1 could increase the pH of the solution to a certain extent, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ozonation. The adjusting effect of pH value is the reason why MgO can significantly improve the efficiency of ozonation, a fact that was ignored in the relevant literature. Although MgO/GAC-1 had a larger specific surface area, MgO/GAC-1 had better activity in ozonation. A recycling test also indicated that MgO/GAC-1 had better stability, showing a good prospect for application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Cun-Wang", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Ya-Lei", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green Chemistry-Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Shao-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29964848", "10.13227/j.hjkx.201704082"]}}]}
