Bromate targets the kidney for toxicity and cancer, the peritoneum for cancer (mesotheliomas derived from testes), testes for lowered sperm count and the thyroid for follicular cell cancer. Kidney tumors as well as other toxicities may be caused by the metabolism of bromate to reactive intermediates. There is evidence that bromate and its stable metabolite bromide are actively transported by the sodium iodide transporter (NIS) protein found in the thyroid, kidney and testes. This association strongly suggests that characterizing the preferential distribution of bromate into the NIS-rich tissues and its subsequent metabolism to reactive metabolites is important for interpreting the dose-response characteristics of bromate in rodents. In this paper the current evidence for NIS dependent dosimetry for bromate is developed and studies are proposed to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for bromate. The recent PBPK models describing NIS protein transport of perchlorate and radiolabeled iodide offer a template for the development of the bromate model in rodents and humans. The proposed research is expected to be instrumental in quantifying the human health risks associated with ingestion of low levels of bromate in drinking water."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Georgia, College of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health Science, Environmental Health Science Bldg., Athens, GA 30602, USA. jwfisher@uga.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fisher", "ForeName": "Jeff", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bull", "ForeName": "Richard J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Toxicology", "NlmUniqueID": "0361055", "ISSNLinking": "0300-483X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bromides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16500013", "10.1016/j.tox.2006.01.022", "S0300-483X(06)00076-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
