Synergistic effect on HA removal was observed in the SDP-AC system; HA removal efficiency reached 60.9% within 5-min treatment in the SDP-AC system with 5.0\u00a0g AC addition, whereas 16.7 and 17.4% of HA were removed in sole SDP system and AC adsorption, respectively. Scanning electron microscope and Boehm titration analysis showed that chemical reactions between active species and functional groups of AC occurred. The existence of isopropanol or benzoquinone exhibited inhibitive effects on HA removal in the SDP system, while these inhibitive effects were weakened in the SDP-AC system. The influences of AC on ozone equivalent concentration and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration were evaluated, and there were approximately 39 and 20% decline in ozone equivalent concentration and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration within 6-min treatment in the SDP-AC system, respectively, compared with those in the sole SDP system. Dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorbance, and UV absorption ratios analysis demonstrated that the SDP treatment destroyed the chromophoric groups, double bonds, and aromatic structure of HA molecules, and these destructive actions were strengthened by AC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Natural Resources and
