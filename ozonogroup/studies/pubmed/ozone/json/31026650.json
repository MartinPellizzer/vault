We investigated whether controlling joint instability inhibited chronic synovial membrane inflammation and delayed osteophyte formation and examined the role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling in the associated mechanism.", "Rats (n\u00a0=\u00a094) underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection. Anterior tibial instability was either controlled (CAM group) or allowed to continue (SHAM group). At 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery, radiologic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examinations were performed to evaluate osteophyte formation and TGF-\u03b2 signaling.", "Joint instability increased cartilage degeneration score and osteophyte formation, and cell hyperplasia and proliferation and synovial thickening were observed in the synovial membrane. Major findings were increased TGF-\u03b2 expression and Smad2/3 following TGF-\u03b2 phosphorylation in synovial membarene, articular cartilage, and the posterior tibial growth plate (TGF-\u03b2 expression using ELISA: 4 weeks; P\u00a0=\u00a00.009, 95% CI [260.1-1340.0]) (p-Smad2/3 expression density: 4 weeks; P\u00a0=\u00a00.024, 95% CI [1.67-18.27], 8 weeks; P\u00a0=\u00a00.034, 95% CI [1.25-25.34]). However, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and Smad1/5/8 levels were not difference between the SHAM model and the CAM model.", "This study showed that the difference between anterior tibial instability caused a change in the expression level of TGF in the posterior tibia and synovial membrane, and the reaction might be consequently involved in osteophyte formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.
