The cases of 6.5 and more octa cloud cover were considered for five solar zenith angle (SZA) ranges up to 80\u00b0. For each of the SZA ranges, the UV(D3) reduced due to the high cloud cover. The average of the ratios of the UV(D3) irradiances on a cloudy day to those on a clear day with the corresponding ozone and SZA are 0.71 for the 6.5-7.5 octa cloud and 0.45 for the more than 7.5 octa cloud ranges. The exposure times necessary to receive 1/3 MED to a horizontal plane were found to increase as the amount of cloud cover increased. For each cloud cover category, the range of values increased with cloud cover and with SZA. This research shows that the current public recommendations on the times of solar UV exposures required to produce adequate vitamin D are inappropriate for situations of more than 6.5 octa cloud."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Queensland 4350, Australia. parisi@usq.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parisi", "ForeName": "Alfio V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turnbull", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Downs", "ForeName": "Nathan J", "Initials": "NJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101124451", "ISSNLinking": "1474-905X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23108371", "10.1039/c2pp25160d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
