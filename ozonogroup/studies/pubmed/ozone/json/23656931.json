Ozone showed less effect on urea hydrolysis due to the complicated composition of urine (including a large amount of urease-producing bacteria) and bacteria regeneration. Ozone concentration and total heterotrophic bacteria analysis demonstrated that residual ozone concentration decreased by 43% within 15 hr from 13.50 to 7.72 mg/L in the one-time ozonation urine test, and finally completely decomposed within 4 days. In addition, bacteria regenerated quickly after ozone completely decomposed. However, HP showed a significant effect on inhibiting urea hydrolysis not only in stored urine but also in fecal-contaminated urine. The suitable doses of applied HP to inhibit urea hydrolysis in stored urine, concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 g feces per liter of fecal-contaminated urine, were 0.03, 0.16 and 0.23 mol/L, respectively. The urea concentrations after 2 months stored were 7,145, 7,109 and 7,234 mg/L, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zifu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shuangling", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "Ibrahim Babatunde", "Initials": "IB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Urine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23656931", "10.2166/wst.2013.055"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
