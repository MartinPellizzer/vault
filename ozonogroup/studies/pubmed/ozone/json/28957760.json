The performance of three commonly used advanced wastewater treatment trains, coagulation-sand filter, coagulation-biological aerated filter (BAF) and ozonation-biological activated carbon (BAC), in removing fifteen residual contaminants and bio-toxicity of the effluent from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were investigated. Relatively high level of OMPs (0.69-14.71\u00a0\u03bcg/L), genotoxicity (22.64\u00a0\u03bcg 4-NQO/L) and estrogenic activity (1.4\u00a0\u03bcg E2/L) were observed from the secondary effluent (SE). Limited OMPs and bio-toxicity reduction was achieved during coagulation with 20\u00a0mg/L of polymeric aluminium and sand filter. Ozonation exhibited high advantage in OMPs, genotoxicity and estrogenic activity reduction. More than 80% of removal was achieved for most OMPs after ozonation with normalized dose of 1.25\u00a0mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC, and the removal of OMPs was consistent well with the second reaction kinetics constants of OMPs with ozone. Based on Pearson correlation analysis, spectroscopy indicators such as UV<sub>254</sub> and total fluorescence (TF) exhibited a high positive correlation with genotoxicity reduction, while estrogenic activity was related well with OMPs variation. To sum up, spectroscopic indicators showed a high potential to indicate the OMPs and bio-toxicity of SE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
