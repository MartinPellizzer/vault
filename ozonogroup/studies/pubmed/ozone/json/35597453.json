In this study, five different MnO<sub>x</sub>/X (X: MCM-41, 13X, ZSM-5, HY, USY) were synthesized and found their support greatly affect the catalytic oxidation activity. MnO<sub>x</sub>/MCM-41 presents the largest specific surface area, pore volume and unique surface morphology, and thereby provides more sites for MnO<sub>x</sub> loading and VOCs adsorption. Moreover, MnO<sub>x</sub>/MCM-41 presents a high proportion of Mn<sup>3+</sup>, which helps to enhance the ion exchange capability, and thus promotes the regeneration of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, a part of Mn was proved to be introduced into the MCM-41 lattice, which can promote the electron transfer between the active components and the support, and thereby effectively improve the surface electronic properties of the catalyst. The toluene catalytic experiments showed that MnO<sub>x</sub>/MCM-41 exhibited the best catalytic activity, presenting complete degradation of O<sub>3</sub> and VOCs at room temperature. In addition, 5\u00a0wt%MnO<sub>x</sub>/MCM-41 exhibited better catalytic activity than other loading, and its higher surface oxygen species endowed it with strong water resistance and stability. In-situ DRIFTs indicated that toluene was initially oxidized into benzyl alcohol during the adsorption process, and then decomposed to intermediate products (benzaldehyde, phenolate, etc.) during the catalytic ozonation process, and finally oxidized to carbon dioxide. In conclusion, the supply of loading sites and the improvement of interfacial electron transfer are the manifestations of the synergy between the support and MnO<sub>x</sub>, leading to the promotion of the catalytic ozonation of VOCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
