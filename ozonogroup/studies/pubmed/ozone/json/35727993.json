This study investigated pretreatment methods such as NaOH, hydrothermal, and ozonation to increase biomethane production from municipal waste. In addition, these pretreatments were further evaluated using ultrasonic pretreatment after achieving optimal conditions by RSM CCD methods. The optimum pretreatment conditions were observed to be 8% NaOH concentration, 132\u2009\u00b0C hydrothermal temperature, and O<sub>3</sub> equal to 0.19\u2009g/g TS. The maximum biomethane produced and achieved during the tests was 394\u2009mL/kg TS, which increased to 410\u2009mL/kg TS after ultrasonic pretreatment. The best sCOD reduction in the optimal pretreatment conditions and after the ultrasonic pretreatment was 87% and 91%, respectively. Also, in the absence of ozone pretreatment, the highest yields of biomethane and biogas occurred at a 6.4% concentration of NaOH and a temperature of 135\u2009\u00b0C; however, in the presence of ozone, the yield of biomethane and biogas produced was greater and the inhibitory effect of sodium hydroxide also occurs in higher amounts. Experiments have shown that ozonation increases biomethane production rather than increasing biogas production (hence the ratio of methane to biogas)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, West Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heydariyan", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, West Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mafigholami", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environment, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Noorpoor", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Biotechnology Department, Agricultural Biotechnology Research Institute of Iran (ABRII), Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghanavati", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, West Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khoramipour", "ForeName": "Sanaz", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biofuels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "55X04QC32I", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anaerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofuels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hydroxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35727993", "10.1080/10934529.2022.2081425"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
