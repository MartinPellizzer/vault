This glass reactor was 0.7 m in height; at a distance of 0.2 m from its bottom, a mesh plane was installed so as to hold the adsorbent. Moreover, 3 l/min oxygen passed through this system, 0.43 g/h ozone was prepared. The flow rate of waste airstream was 300 ml/min. The efficiency of this system for removal of toluene was compared under the same experimental conditions.", "Under similar conditions, performance of catalytic ozonation was better in toluene removal than that of ozonation and carbosieve alone. On average, increasing the removal efficiency was 45% at all concentrations. When carbosieve and ozone come together, their synergistic effects increased on toluene degradation.", "Catalytic ozonation is a suitable, high-efficient and available method for removing toluene from various concentrations of waste air stream. This process due to the short contact time, low energy consuming and making use of cheap catalysts can be used as a novel process for removing various concentrations of volatile organic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Health Sciences and Department of Environmental Engineering, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Samarghandi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Health Sciences and Department of Environmental Engineering, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Babaee", "ForeName": "Seyed Alireza", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadian", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Health Sciences and Department of Environmental Engineering, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgari", "ForeName": "Ghorban", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Research Center for Health Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani Shahna", "ForeName": "Farshid", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Development & Health Promotion Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. apoormohammadi000@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Poormohammadi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "J Res Health Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101480094", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7795"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3FPU23BG52", "NameOfSubstance": "Toluene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Toluene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "3", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25209912", "1182"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
