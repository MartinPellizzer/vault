We will also turn to other types of abiotic stresses, less studied in relation to polyamine metabolism, such as mineral deficiencies, chilling, wounding, heavy metals, UV, ozone and paraquat, where polyamine metabolism is also modified. There is a great amount of data demonstrating that under many types of abiotic stresses, an accumulation of the three main polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine does occur. However, there are still many doubts concerning the role that polyamines play in stress tolerance. Several environmental challenges (osmotic stress, salinity, ozone, UV) are shown to induce ADC activity more than ODC. The rise in Put is mainly attributed to the increase in ADC activity as a consequence of the activation of ADC genes and their mRNA levels. On the other hand, free radicals are now accepted as important mediators of tissue injury and cell death. The polycationic nature of polyamines, positively charged at physiological pH, has attracted the attention of researchers and has led to the hypothesis that polyamines could affect physiological systems by binding to anionic sites, such as those associated with nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids. These amines, involved with the control of numerous cellular functions, including free radical scavenger and antioxidant activity, have been found to confer protection from abiotic stresses but their mode of action is not fully understood yet. In this review, we will also summarize information about the involvement of polyamines as antioxidants against the potential abiotic stress-derived oxidative damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Groppa", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Benavides", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Amino Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "9200312", "ISSNLinking": "0939-4451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disasters"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osmotic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}], "NumberOfReferences": "107"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17356805", "10.1007/s00726-007-0501-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
