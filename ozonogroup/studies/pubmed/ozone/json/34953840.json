However, the microbial mechanisms regulating N<sub>2</sub>O emission in riparian zones remain unknown. Here, we measured the contributions of denitrification and ammonium oxidation to N<sub>2</sub>O emission along with the abundance and community structure of nirK-, nirS-, nosZ I- and nosZ II-harbouring bacteria in both surface sediments (0-10\u00a0cm) and overlying water along a lake riparian zone (including nearshore sites and offshore sites). Overall, the nearshore sites of the riparian zones emitted less N<sub>2</sub>O than the offshore sites. Nearshore N<sub>2</sub>O emission was dominated by denitrification with a high N<sub>2</sub>O reduction rate, whereas offshore N<sub>2</sub>O emission was driven by ammonium oxidation. Furthermore, N<sub>2</sub>O derived from ammonium oxidation was influenced by the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N content, and denitrification N<sub>2</sub>O was modulated by denitrifier communities. The N<sub>2</sub>O-producing community was dominated by nirS-harbouring bacteria, while the N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing community was dominated by nosZ I-harbouring bacteria. The relative abundance of Hydrogenophilales from nirS-denitrifiers and Chloroflexi unclassified from nosZ II-type communities influenced the N<sub>2</sub>O produced by denitrification, according to high-throughput sequencing analysis. Additionally, we also found lower levels of N<sub>2</sub>O production per unit volume in overlying water, which were 3-4 orders of magnitude less than in the surface sediment. Overall, we propose that using riparian zones can be an effective management tool for N<sub>2</sub>O mitigation by enhancing the N<sub>2</sub>O reduction process of denitrification and decreasing ammonium oxidation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
