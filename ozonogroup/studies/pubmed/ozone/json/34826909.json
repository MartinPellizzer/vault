Plasma-treated water (PTW) containing many active species, that play dominant roles in the degradation of organic substances like hydroxyl radicals, atomic oxygen, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide, was used in this study as a strategy to improve degradation performance without the use of expensive chemical reagents like hydrogen peroxide. In particular, the optimal decomposition conditions using PTW, which were combined with 10\u00a0mg/h ozone, 2\u00a0g/L iron oxide, and 4\u00a0W UV light, demonstrated excellent removal abilities of a high concentration of reactive black 5 (RB5; 100\u00a0mg/L, >99%, [k]\u00a0=\u00a04.15 h<sup>-1</sup>) and tetracycline (TC; 10 mg/L, >96.5%, [k]\u00a0=\u00a03.35 h<sup>-1</sup>) for 25\u00a0min, approximately 1.5 times higher than that without PTW (RB5; 100\u00a0mg/L, 94%, [k]\u00a0=\u00a02.80 h<sup>-1</sup>). These results confirmed that the production of strong reactive hydroxyl radicals from the decomposition process, as well as various reactive species included in PTW efficiently attacked pollutant substances, resulting in a higher removal rate. This suggests that a water treatment system with this optimal condition based on complex AOP systems using PTW could be useful in critical environmental and biomedical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
