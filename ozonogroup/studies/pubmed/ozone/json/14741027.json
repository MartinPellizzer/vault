The establishment of quantitative structure-property relationships is of interest not only to fill in gaps in the available database but also to validate experimental data already acquired. The three-dimensional structures of 240 compounds were modeled with molecular mechanics prior to the generation of empirical descriptors. Two bilinear projection methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial-least-squares regression (PLSR), were used to identify outliers. PLSR was subsequently used to build a multivariate calibration model by extracting the latent variables that describe most of the covariation between the molecular structure and the boiling point. Boiling points were also estimated with an extension of the group contribution method of Stein and Brown."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science, University of Kalmar, SE-391 82 Kalmar, Sweden. tomas.oberg@hik.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oberg", "ForeName": "Tomas", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Inf Comput Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7505012", "ISSNLinking": "0095-2338"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Chem Inf Comput Sci. 2005 Mar-Apr;45(2):534"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14741027", "10.1021/ci034183v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
