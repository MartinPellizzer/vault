However, health effects caused by whole effluent remain largely unknown due to the lack of human relevant model for toxicity test. Effluents from four secondary wastewater treatment plants (SWTPs), a tertiary wastewater treatment plant (TWTP) and a constructed wetland (CW) were evaluated for the integrated toxicity of the organic extractions. Multiple-endpoint human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) assay was used as an in vitro model relevant to human health. The effluents caused cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and genotoxicity in MSCs. The osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation were inhibited and the adipogenic differentiation were stimulated by some of the effluent extractions. The SWTP, TWTP and CW treatments reduced integrated biomarker response (IBR) by 26.3\u00a0%, 17.5\u00a0% and 33.3\u00a0% respectively, where the IBR values of final CW (8.3) and TWTP (8.2) effluents were relatively lower than SWTPs (9.1). Among multiple biomarkers, the inhibition of osteogenesis was the least reduced by wastewater treatment. Besides, ozone disinfection in tertiary treatment increased cytotoxicity and differentiation effects suggesting the generation of toxic products. The mRNA expressions of estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) were significantly upregulated by effluents. The inhibitory effects of effluents on neural differentiation were mitigated after antagonizing ER\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 in the cells. It is suggested that ER\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 agonists in effluents were largely accountable for the impairment of stem cell differentiation. Besides, the concentrations of n-C<sub>29</sub>H<sub>60</sub>, o-cresol, fluorene and phenanthrene in the effluents were significantly correlated with the intergrated stem cell toxicity. The present study provided toxicological evidence for the relation between water contamination and human health, with an insight into the key toxicity drivers. The necessity for deep water treatment and the potential means were suggested for improving water quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
