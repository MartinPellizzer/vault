An index, the relative sensitivity to ozone, was calculated for each species based on changes in biomass in order to test for species traits associated with ozone sensitivity. Meta-analysis of the ozone sensitivity data showed a wide inter-specific range in response to ozone. Some relationships in comparison to plant physiological and ecological characteristics were identified. Plants of the therophyte lifeform were particularly sensitive to ozone. Species with higher mature leaf N concentration were more sensitive to ozone than those with lower leaf N concentration. Some relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and Ellenberg habitat requirements were also identified. In contrast, no relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and mature leaf P concentration, Grime's CSR strategy, leaf longevity, flowering season, stomatal density and maximum altitude were found. The relative sensitivity of species and relationships with plant characteristics identified in this study could be used to predict sensitivity to ozone of untested species and communities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre For Ecology and Hydrology, Deiniol Road, Bangor, Gwynedd, LL57 2UP, UK. fhay@ceh.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "M L M", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mills", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashmore", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16899330", "10.1016/j.envpol.2006.06.011", "S0269-7491(06)00389-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
