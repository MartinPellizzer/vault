In this study, we generated two soot samples under higher and lower air/fuel ratio (A/F) conditions, and further treated them with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at a level similar to that in the polluted atmosphere. The physicochemical properties and OP values (measured by dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, OP<sup>DTT</sup>) of fresh and ozonised soot samples were compared to investigate the influences of A/F and O<sub>3</sub> aging. Both A/F and O<sub>3</sub> aging significantly affected soot physicochemical properties and OP<sup>DTT</sup> values. Lower A/F was favourable for generating soot particles containing more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and light-absorbing organics, but fewer oxygen-containing groups. After O<sub>3</sub> aging, a decline in PAHs and increase in oxygen-containing groups and WSOC were observed in both aged soot samples. In addition, both lower A/F and O<sub>3</sub> aging enhanced soot OP<sup>DTT</sup> values. Soot generated under lower A/F was more sensitive to O<sub>3</sub> aging, after which there was a significantly greater change in physicochemical characteristics, in turn contributing substantially to the greater OP increase observed in low-A/F soot."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
