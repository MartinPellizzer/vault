To determine the source-sink dynamics of coastal salt marshes for CFC-11 and CFC-12 in the local atmosphere, we studied a coastal salt marsh in Northern Jiangsu Province, taking measurements of the atmospheric concentrations and fluxes of CFC-11 and CFC-12 using static flux chambers in August (growing season) and December (non-growing season) of 2013, and along both creek-side and vegetated transects. We observed unexpectedly high concentrations of CFC-11 (676.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-12</sup>) and CFC-12 (794.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-12</sup>) in the salt marsh in 2013, with predominantly non-local emissions. Overall, the study salt marsh acted as a net sink for CFC-11 and CFC-12, with the average flux ranging from -11.4\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> for CFC-11 and from -7.4\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> to 0.7\u00a0\u03bcg m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> for CFC-12. This clearly indicates that the high concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 measured in the atmosphere were not caused by local emissions; terrigenous sources most likely act as the main exogenous input pathway. Our study suggests that salt marsh ecosystems may be worthy of attention as sinks for CFC-11 and CFC-12; as such, the ecological restoration of salt marshes is critical to better offset increasing CFC-11 and CFC-12 emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
