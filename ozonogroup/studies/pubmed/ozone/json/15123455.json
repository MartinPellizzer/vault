The field trial with open-top chambers (OTCs) was conducted on two clones (Clone 4 and Clone 80) with five treatments and four independent replicates. Treatments were: (1) outside control, (2) chamber control, (3) 2x ambient [O3], (4) 2x ambient [CO2] and (5) 2x ambient [CO2] + 2x ambient [O3]. Fumigations started in 1999 and continued in 2000. Measurements were made in 1998 before the fumigations and thereafter EIS was carried out four times in each season. The impedance spectra of about 10 leaves from each tree at each time were measured at 42 frequencies between 80 and 1 MHz. Leaf spectra were modeled by a distributed circuit element model (DCE) (one DCE in series with a resistor), which yields the extracellular and intracellular resistances, the relaxation time and the distribution coefficient of the relaxation time. The EIS properties of the leaves changed significantly during the growing season when new leaves were expanding. The clones differed in their EIS properties. Clone 4 had a significantly higher extracellular resistance and distribution coefficient than Clone 80. The clones responded similarly to the fumigation treatments. Differences between treatments emerged especially during the second fumigation season in 2000. Elevated [O3] reduced both the relaxation time and the extracellular resistance, indicating cell membrane damage. Elevated [CO2] increased the intracellular resistance, indicating changes in symplastic composition. The biological interpretation of the EIS parameters in birch leaves is discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 Heron Publishing"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Finnish Forest Research Institute, Joensuu Research Centre, P.O.
