Coffee is a popular daily beverage, and thus, coffee beans and spent coffee grounds are common in many places such as offices, homes, aircraft, cafeterias, and such. The most common material used to remove ozone is activated carbon which can be made from coffee beans or spent coffee grounds with proper activation processes. This paper presents a novel idea: to remove ozone at the level of an indoor environment using unactivated coffee products. This paper examines the ozone removal efficiency and the ozone deposition velocity at 130 ppb ozone for two types of coffee: solid coffee (powder) and liquid coffee (beverage). The activated carbon, the deionized water, and the seawater are also included for comparison and validation purposes. The tests show that the fine coffee powder has a removal efficiency of 58.5% and a deposition velocity of 0.62 cm/s. The liquid coffee has a removal efficiency of 34.4% and a deposition velocity of 0.23 cm/s. The chemical inspections indicate that the oxidation reactions with the carbohydrates in solid coffee and the metal/mineral elements in liquid coffee are responsible for ozone removal. These results have confirmed that ozone removal via coffee is effective, controlling indoor air quality by coffee products is thus becoming possible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Speed 3D Printing Research Center, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "En-Ying", "Initials": "EY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7683-1546"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Speed 3D Printing Research Center, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Tsrong-Yi", "Initials": "TY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution, Indoor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aircraft"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nuvolone D., Petri D., and Voller F., \"The effects of ozone on human health,\" Environmental Science and Pollution Research, vol. 25, no. 9, pp. 8074\u20138088, 2018. doi: 10.1007/s11356-017-9239-3", "ArticleIdList": ["10.1007/s11356-017-9239-3", "28547375"]}, {"Citation": "Goudarzi G. et al., \"Cardiovascular and respiratory mortality attributed to ground-level ozone in Ahvaz, Iran,\" Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, vol. 187, no. 8, p. 487, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s10661-015-4674-4", "ArticleIdList": ["10.1007/s10661-015-4674-4", "26141926"]}, {"Citation": "Yan M., Liu Z., Liu X., Duan H., and Li T., \"Meta-analysis of the Chinese studies of the association between ambient ozone and mortality,\" Chemosphere, vol. 93, no. 6, pp. 899\u2013905, 2013. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.040", "ArticleIdList": ["10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.040", "23786810"]}, {"Citation": "USPEA, \"Updates to the air quality index (AQI) for ozone and ozone monitoring requirements,\" The National Ambient Air Quality Standards, pp. 1\u20136, 2015."}, {"Citation": "Park S.
