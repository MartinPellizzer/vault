Little is known about DBPs formation from different molecular weight (MW) fractions, especially for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). This study fractionated EOM and IOM into several MW fractions using a series of ultrafiltration membranes and is the first to report on the C-DBPs and N-DBPs formation from chlorination and chloramination of different MW fractions. Results showed that EOM and IOM were mainly distributed in low-MW (<1\u00a0KDa) and high-MW (>100\u00a0KDa) fractions. Additionally, the low-MW and high-MW fractions of EOM and IOM generally took an important part in forming C-DBPs and N-DBPs, either in chlorination or in chloramination. Furthermore, the effects of pre-ozonation on the formation of DBPs in subsequent chlorination and chloramination were also investigated. It was found that ozone shifted the high-MW fractions of EOM and IOM into lower MW fractions and increased the C-DBPs and N-DBPs yields to different degrees. As low-MW fractions are more difficult to remove than high-MW fractions by conventional treatment processes, therefore, activated carbon adsorption, nanofiltration (NF) and biological treatment processes can be ideal to remove the low-MW fractions and minimize the formation potential of C-DBPs and N-DBPs. Moreover, the use of ozone should be carefully considered in the treatment of algal-rich water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
