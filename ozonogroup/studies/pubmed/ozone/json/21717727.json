The ozone at urban station exhibited stronger diurnal and seasonal variations than that at the rural station. The maximum concentrations of ozone were 198.9 x 10(-9) and 151.2 x 10(-9) at Beijing and Xinglong, while there were 171 hours and 255 hours in which ozone exceeded the China's norm, respectively. 90% of the exceeding occurrences happened before 16:00 in Beijing, while more than 82% happened at night in Xinglong. The peak concentration of ozone at Xinglong in the diurnal cycle was 3-4 hours lag of that at Beijing because of the influence of air mass from Beijing. Double ozone peaks phenomena can be found at Xinglong due to the mountain-valley breezes especially in the summertime. Stagnant meteorological conditions and mountain-valley breezes can cause ozone accumulation at downwind areas. The AOT40 values were 23.1 x 10(-6) x h, 26.5 x 10(-6) x h, and 14.1 x 10(-6) x h in spring, summer and autumn respectively at Xinglong, which could cause more than 30% lose in wheat yields."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urban Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100089, China. zqma@ium.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-Si", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ling", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meteorological Concepts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suburban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21717727"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
