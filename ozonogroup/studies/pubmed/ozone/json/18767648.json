Cyclohexane and 2-butanol (3-40 x 10(13) molecules cm(-3)) were used as scavengers and compared to experiments without any scavenger. The reactions were conducted at 298 K and at relative humidities between <10 and 80%. The yield of SOA decreased in the order \"no scavenger\" > 2-butanol > cyclohexane. The effect of water vapor was similar for 2-butanol and without a scavenger, with an increase in particle number and mass concentration with increasing relative humidity. The water effect for cyclohexane was more complex, depending on the terpene, scavenger concentration, and SOA concentration. The water effect seems to be influenced by the HO2/RO2 ratio. The results are discussed in relation to the currently suggested mechanism for alkene ozonolysis and to atmospheric importance. The results imply that the ozone-initiated oxidation of terpenes needs revision in order to fully account for the role of water in the chemical mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Atmospheric Science, University of Gothenburg, SE-412 96 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. asajon@chem.gu.se"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jonsson", "ForeName": "Asa M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hallquist", "ForeName": "Mattias", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ljungstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "Evert", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9159UV381P", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroxide ion"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H2M15SNR6N", "NameOfSubstance": "3-carene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18767648", "10.1021/es702508y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
