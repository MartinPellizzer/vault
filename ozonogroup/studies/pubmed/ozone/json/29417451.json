Selected previous literature is discussed where relevant in tracing the origins of our current knowledge.", "Climate and weather have strong influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of air pollution concentrations. Emissions of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub> precursors increase at higher ambient temperatures. The reactions that form ozone occur faster with greater sunlight and higher temperatures. Weather systems influence the movement and dispersion of air pollutants in the atmosphere through the action of winds, vertical mixing, and precipitation, all of which are likely to alter in a changing climate. Recent studies indicate that, holding anthropogenic air pollution emissions constant, ozone concentrations in populated regions will tend to increase in future climate scenarios. For the USA, the climate impact on ozone is most consistently seen in north-central and north-eastern states, with the potential for many thousands of additional ozone-related deaths. The sensitivity of anthropogenic PM<sub>2.5</sub> to climate is more variable across studies and regions, owing to the varied nature of PM constituents, as well as to less complete characterization of PM reaction chemistry in available atmospheric models. However, PM emitted by wildland fires is likely to become an increasing health risk in many parts of the world as climate continues to change. The complex interactions between climate change and air quality imply that future policies to mitigate these twin challenges will benefit from greater coordination. Assessing the health implications of alternative policy approaches towards climate and pollution mitigation will be a critical area of future work."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Boston University School of Public Health, 715 Albany Street, Talbot 4W, Boston, MA, 02118, USA. pkinney@bu.edu."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kinney", "ForeName": "Patrick L", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Curr Environ Health Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101629387", "ISSNLinking": "2196-5412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Inhalation Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 2003 Nov 7;302(5647):1024-7", "ArticleIdList": ["14605365"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Prev Med. 2008 Nov;35(5):459-67", "ArticleIdList": ["18929972"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 2017 May 13;389(10082):1907-1918", "ArticleIdList": ["28408086"]}, {"Citation": "Asia Pac J Public Health. 2016 Mar;28(2 Suppl):38S-48S", "ArticleIdList": ["26141092"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2015 Jun;65(6):645-85", "ArticleIdList": ["25976481"]}, {"Citation": "BMJ. 2016 Oct 20;355:i5620", "ArticleIdList": ["27765779"]}, {"Citation": "Nat Commun. 2015 Jul 14;6:7537", "ArticleIdList": ["26172867"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2004 Nov;112(15):1557-63", "ArticleIdList": ["15531442"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Nov;120(11):1559-64", "ArticleIdList": ["22796531"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2005 Jan 1;39(1):24-32", "ArticleIdList": ["15667071"]}, {"Citation": "Eur Respir J. 2013 Sep;42(3):826-43", "ArticleIdList": ["23314896"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Sci Technol. 2015 Jul 7;49(13):7580-8", "ArticleIdList": ["26053628"]}, {"Citation": "J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol. 2017 Jan;27(1):118-124", "ArticleIdList": ["27005744"]}, {"Citation": "Eur Respir J. 2013 Feb;41(2):285-94", "ArticleIdList": ["22743679"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 2017 Feb;125(2):141-148", "ArticleIdList": ["27323709"]}, {"Citation": "Bull World Health Organ. 2014 Aug 1;92(8):553-4", "ArticleIdList": ["25177069"]}, {"Citation": "Lancet. 2015 Nov 7;386(10006):1861-914", "ArticleIdList": ["26111439"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2015 May;65(5):570-80", "ArticleIdList": ["25947315"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29417451", "10.1007/s40572-018-0188-x", "10.1007/s40572-018-0188-x"]}}]}
