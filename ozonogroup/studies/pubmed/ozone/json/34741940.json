The toluene removal efficiency followed the order of Cu<sub>0.2</sub>MnO<sub>x</sub> (91.2%) \u02c3 CuMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (74.5%) \u02c3 commercial catalyst Cu<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>x</sub> (70.3%) in 130\u00a0min, and the higher CO<sub>2</sub> yield (67.6%) could be also observed using Cu<sub>0.2</sub>MnO<sub>x</sub>. In order to investigate the effect of phases on the toluene degradation pathway, the intermediates and byproducts were identified by DRIFTS, GC-MS, and TOF-SIMS. No obvious difference was observed in the distribution of byproducts, except for the quantities, suggesting the discrepancy of oxidation rate. On the other hand, the catalysts were characterized before and after the ozonation process by TEM, BET, XPS, XRD, EPR, TGA, and TPR. It was proposed that for amorphous catalysts, the oxygen vacancy (V<sub>o</sub>) helped the chemisorption of toluene, and adjacent Mn reacted as the main active site for the ozonation process. While, the redox pair of Cu<sup>+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>/(Mn<sup>3+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in the spinel phase plays an important role in the generation of oxygen vacancies for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
