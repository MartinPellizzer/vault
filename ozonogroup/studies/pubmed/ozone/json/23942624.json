For the first time, direct experimental evidence of the I2Oy (y = 1,\u2026,5) molecules in the gas phase has been obtained. These chemical species are observed alongside their precursors (IO and OIO) in experiments where large amounts of aerosol are also generated. The measured relative concentrations of the IxOy molecules and their dependence on ozone concentration have been investigated by using chemical modelling and rate theory calculations. It is concluded that I2O4 is the most plausible candidate to initiate nucleation, while the contribution of I2O5 in the initial steps is likely to be marginal. The absence of large I3Oy (y = 3,\u2026,6) peaks in the mass spectra and the high stability of the I2O4-I2O4 dimer indicate that dimerisation of I2O4 is the key step in iodine oxide particle nucleation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, LS2 9JT, Leeds, UK. chmjgm@leeds.ac.uk."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez Mart\u00edn", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00e1lvez", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baeza-Romero", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ingham", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plane", "ForeName": "J M C", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blitz", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23942624", "10.1039/c3cp51217g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
