This potential increases with rising temperatures and may lead to severe problems with air quality in densely populated areas during heat waves. Here, we investigate how heat waves affect emissions of volatile organic compounds from urban/suburban vegetation and corresponding ground-level ozone and particulate matter. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with atmospheric chemistry (WRF-Chem) with emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vegetation simulated with MEGAN to quantify some of these feedbacks in Berlin, Germany, during the heat wave in 2006. The highest ozone concentration observed during that period was \u223c200 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (\u223c101 ppb<sub>V</sub>). The model simulations indicate that the contribution of biogenic VOC emissions to ozone formation is lower in June (9-11%) and August (6-9%) than in July (17-20%). On particular days within the analyzed heat wave period, this contribution increases up to 60%. The actual contribution is expected to be even higher as the model underestimates isoprene concentrations over urban forests and parks by 0.6-1.4 ppb<sub>v</sub>. Our study demonstrates that biogenic VOCs can considerably enhance air pollution during heat waves. We emphasize the dual role of vegetation for air quality and human health in cities during warm seasons, which is removal and lessening versus enhancement of air pollution. The results of our study suggest that reduction of anthropogenic sources of NOx, VOCs, and PM, for example, reduction of the motorized vehicle fleet, would have to accompany urban tree planting campaigns to make them really beneficial for urban dwellers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies , Berliner Strasse 130, 14467 Potsdam, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Geography Department, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin , Unter den Linden, 10099 Berlin, Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5895-7425"], "LastName": "Churkina", "ForeName": "Galina", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies , Berliner Strasse 130, 14467 Potsdam, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuik", "ForeName": "Friderike", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies , Berliner Strasse 130, 14467 Potsdam, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Forest Sciences, Chair of Tree Physiology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg , Georges-K\u00f6hler-Allee 53, 79110 Freiburg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bonn", "ForeName": "Boris", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) , Institut f\u00fcr Physik der Atmosph\u00e4re, M\u00fcnchener Stra\u00dfe 20, 82234 We\u00dfling, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lauer", "ForeName": "Axel", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies , Berliner Strasse 130, 14467 Potsdam, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) , Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK-IFU), Kreuzeckbahnstrasse 19, 82467 Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grote", "ForeName": "R\u00fcdiger", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies , Berliner Strasse 130, 14467 Potsdam, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomiak", "ForeName": "Karolina", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies , Berliner Strasse 130, 14467 Potsdam, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Butler", "ForeName": "Tim M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Berlin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28513175", "10.1021/acs.est.6b06514"]}}]}
