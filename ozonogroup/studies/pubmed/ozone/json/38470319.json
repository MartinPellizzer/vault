Residential exposure to ambient air pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone were estimated by satellite-models or ground measurement. Multivariate regression analyses explored the association between annual air pollutants exposure and the risk of APAC.", "Of the 1011 participants (31.1% were male subjects), the average age was 64.0\u00a0years. Long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 were significantly associated with an increased risk of APAC. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for each interquartile range (IQR) increment of PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 were 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.57), 1.26 (95% CI = 1.06-1.50), and 1.30 (95% CI = 1.04-1.62) separately, after controlling for confounders. Robust associations were observed for a longer lag 2-year exposure.", "Long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 was associated with an increased risk of APAC in a Chinese population.
