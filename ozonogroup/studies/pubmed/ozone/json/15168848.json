Ozonation of biomass resulted in mass reduction by mineralization as well as by ozone-disintegrated biosolids recycling. Approximately 50% of wasted solids were recovered as available organic matter (ozonolysate), which included nonsettleable microparticles and soluble fractions. Microparticles were observed in abundance at relatively low levels of ozone doses, while soluble fractions became dominant at higher levels of ozone doses in ozone-disintegrated organics. Batch denitrification experiments showed that the ozonolysate could be used as a carbon source with a maximum denitrification rate of 3.66 mg nitrogen (N)/g volatile suspended solids (VSS) x h. Ozonolysate was also proven to enhance total nitrogen removal efficiency in the pilot-scale treatment facility. An optimal chemical oxygen demand (COD)-to-nitrogen ratio for complete denitrification was estimated as 5.13 g COD/g N. The nitrogen-removal performance of the modified intermittently decanted extended aeration process dependent on an external carbon supply could be described as a function of solids retention time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecotechnology Research Group, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Cheongryang, South Korea. pky@kist.re.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Ki Young", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jae Woo", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Kyu-Hong", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeng", "ForeName": "Sung Kyu", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Jong Hyuk", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Kyung-Guen", "Initials": "KG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Water Environ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9886167", "ISSNLinking": "1061-4303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15168848", "10.2175/106143004x141690"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
