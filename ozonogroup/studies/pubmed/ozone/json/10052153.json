The proposed device is electronically peak detecting; the user would ideally 'point and paint' the sun to find a localized maximum. A projected exposure time can be calculated from an instantaneous reading of erythemally weighted flux for a given minimal erythemal dose (MED) specified by the user. This calculation, though not necessarily providing a true exposure time, may be useful and informative in that it serves as a more 'recognizable' measure of erythemal flux and introduces a custom scale for each individual via their MED. Erythemal flux is calculated as the weighted integral sum [symbol: see text]j(lambda,t) epsilon(lambda) d lambda, where j (lambda, t) is the instantaneous angular integrated spectral irradiance accepted by human skin. This instrument proposal uses a single interference filter over a Pt-CdS photodiode; the interference filter is offered as a nominal design transmittance. The simulated response of the selective photodiode has a near-linear relation to the effective irradiance. Test inputs for evaluation purposes and to elucidate a transducer response are constructed from a spline interpolation of the World Radiation Center (WRC) spectrum and classic transmittance models. Our desired erythemal flux is offered in interconvertible UV Indexes (UVIs) as a function of zenith angle and atmosphere, characterized by elevation, ozone path, and turbidity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri-Rolla 65401, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richards", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boone", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Photochem Photobiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8804966", "ISSNLinking": "1011-1344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "057EZR4Z7Q", "NameOfSubstance": "cadmium sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10052153", "10.1016/s1011-1344(98)00180-8", "S1011134498001808"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
