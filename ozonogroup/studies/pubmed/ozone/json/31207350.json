The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) was treated with saturated aqueous ozone for different amounts of time, and by-products were collected for compounds annotation and cytotoxicity evaluation. To investigate the cytotoxicity of ozone degradation by-products, untargeted GC-TOFMS-based metabolomics were utilized. Caco-2\u202fcells were dosed with 0.1\u202f\u03bcg/mL DON and saturated aqueous ozone-treated DON (treatment time: 1\u202fmin, 3\u202fmin, 5\u202fmin) for 24\u202fh followed by cytotoxicity tests (cell viability assay, ROS assay, and apoptosis assay), and intracellular metabolic analysis. Cytotoxicity test results revealed that ozone treatment could degrade DON structure; however, its degradation products and cellular toxicity existed under different treatment time of ozone. Metabolomics analysis indicated that ozone-treated DON degradation products weakened DON-induced metabolic disorder, such as purines-related nucleotide metabolism; Krebs cycle-related fuel and energy metabolism; and lipid, alkaloid and amino acid metabolism. By contrast, the catecholamine pathway, which is related to latent inflammation and oxidative stress effects, was unaltered in the ozone-treated DON group, indicating that the potential cytotoxicity still existed. These findings provide a comprehensive safety evaluation for ozone-treated DON in vitro and propose a new strategy for studying the effects of ozone-treated food."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
