Although BMAA has been shown to be removed in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), studies regarding the reactions between BMAA and the commonly used oxidants in DWTPs are limited to chlorine under specific conditions. In this study, the reaction kinetics between BMAA and five oxidants commonly used in DWTPs, including chlorine, potassium permanganate, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were investigated. The oxidation of BMAA by chlorine, ozone or OH radical followed the second order reaction rate law, and the reaction rate was in the order of OH radicals\u202f>\u202fozone\u202f>>\u202fchlorine. The rate constants increased by 20 times from 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>\u202fat pH 5.8 to 4.93\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>4</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>\u202fat pH 7, and kept in a relatively stable level at pH 7-9.5; rate constants of OH radicals were 1.11\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>8</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>\u202fat pH 6.5 and 5.51\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>9</sup>- 1.35\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>10</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>\u202fat pH\u202f>\u202f6.5. For both permanganate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only, the removal of BMAA was negligible. The pH dependency of chlorine and the OH radical may be attributed to the neutral form of BMAA with free lone pair electrons readily to be attacked by oxidants. However, for ozonation of BMAA, the rate constants were 1.88\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>6</sup>-3.72\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>10</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, with a linear dependency on pH, implying that the hydroxide concentration governs the reaction. In addition, the rate of BMAA degradation was found to be slower in natural water if compared with that in deionized water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
