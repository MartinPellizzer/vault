Rate constants obtained for the NO 3 radical and O 3 reactions at 296 +/- 2 K were (6.1 +/- 1.4) x 10 (-16) and (4.3 +/- 1.0) x 10 (-19) cm (3) molecule (-1) s (-1), respectively. For the OH radical reaction, the temperature-dependent rate expression obtained was k = 4.17 x 10 (-12)e ((858 +/- 141)/ T ) cm (3) molecule (-1) s (-1) with a 298 K rate constant of (7.43 +/- 0.71) x 10 (-11) cm (3) molecule (-1) s (-1), where, in all cases, the errors are two standard deviations and do not include the uncertainties in the rate constants for the reference compounds. Divinyl sulfone was observed as a minor product of both the OH radical and NO 3 radical reactions at 296 +/- 2 K. Using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, CO, CO 2, SO 2, HCHO, and divinyl sulfone were observed as products of the OH radical reaction, with molar formation yields of 35 +/- 11, 2.2 +/- 0.8, 33 +/- 4, 54 +/- 6, and 5.4 +/- 0.8%, respectively, in air. For the experimental conditions employed, aerosol formation from the OH radical-initiated reaction of DVSO in the presence of NO was minor, being approximately 1.5%. The data obtained here for DVSO are compared with literature data for the corresponding reactions of dimethyl sulfoxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Research Center, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aschmann", "ForeName": "Sara M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tuazon", "ForeName": "Ernesto C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "William D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atkinson", "ForeName": "Roger", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16E0524PXI", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrogen trioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Oxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfoxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vinyl Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18717539", "10.1021/jp803223e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
