A novel technology, hydrodynamic cavitation combined with ozone (HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>), has attracted wide attention in wastewater advanced treatment, whereas the contaminants removal mechanism and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were rarely reported. This study investigated the removal efficiency and mechanism of HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. The maximum removal rates of UV<sub>254</sub>, chrominance, COD<sub>Cr</sub>, and TOC were 64.99%, 91.90%, 32.30%, and 36.67% in 60\u00a0min, respectively, at the inlet pressure of 0.15\u00a0MPa and O<sub>3</sub> dosage of 6.25\u00a0mmol/L. The synergetic coefficient of HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> was 2.77. The removal of contaminants was the synergy of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, \u00b7OH and \u00b7O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and high molecular weight and strong aromaticity organic matters were degraded effectively. The main components in DOM were tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like, which were effectively removed after HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>. Meanwhile, most DOM had decreased to low apparent relative molecular weight (LARMW) compounds. Additionally, the HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> effluent can reach the emission standard in 60\u00a0min for 8.07 USD/m<sup>3</sup>. It can be concluded that HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> is an effective technology for the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater. This study will provide suggestions for the engineering application of HC\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
