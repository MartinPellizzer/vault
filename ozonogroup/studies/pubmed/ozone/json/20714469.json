A flow of single component aqueous particles with average size diameters in the range 2.6-2.9 \u00b5m were exposed to a known concentration of ozone for a controlled period of time in an aerosol flow tube in which products were monitored by infrared spectroscopy. The results obtained are consistent with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type mechanism for the heterogeneous oxidation of maleic/fumaric acid aerosol particles by gas-phase ozone, for which the following parameters were found: for the reaction of maleic acid aerosols, K(O(3)) = (9 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10(-15) cm(3) molecule(-1) and k = (0.21 \u00b1 0.01) s(-1); for the reaction of fumaric acid aerosols, K(O(3)) = (5 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 10(-15) cm(3) molecule(-1) and k = (0.19 \u00b1 0.01) s(-1). From the pseudo-first-order coefficients, apparent uptake coefficient values were calculated for which a decreasing trend with increasing ozone concentrations was observed. Comparison with previous measurements of the same system under dry conditions reveals a direct effect of the presence of water on the mechanism of these reactions, in which the water is seen to increase the formation of CO(2) and formic acid (HCO(2)H) through increased levels of hydroxyacetyl hydroperoxide intermediate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, The University of Manchester, M13 9PL Manchester, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "N\u00e1jera", "ForeName": "Juan J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "Carl J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Horn", "ForeName": "Andrew B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20714469", "10.1039/b924775k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
