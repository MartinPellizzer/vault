zoster neuralgia in the neck and upper extremities. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 110 patients with acute phase herpes zoster neuralgia in the neck and upper extremities treated in the Department of Pain of Jiaxing First Hospital from January 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively included. The patients were divided into two groups according to different treatment modalities: the pulsed radiofrequency group (group A, <i>n</i>=68) and the pulsed radiofrequency combined with ozone injection group (group B, <i>n</i>=42). In group A, there were 40 males and 28 females, aged (71.9\u00b19.9) years, while group B consisted of 23 males and 19 females, aged (66.3\u00b116.9) years. Patients were followed up, and numerical rating scale (NRS) score, dose of adjuvant gabapentin, incidence of clinically significant postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and adverse effects were recorded preoperatively (T<sub>0</sub>) and at 1 d (T<sub>1</sub>), 3 d (T<sub>2</sub>), 1 week (T<sub>3</sub>), 1 month (T<sub>4</sub>), 2 months (T<sub>5</sub>), and 3 months (T<sub>6</sub>) postoperatively. <b>Results:</b> The NRS score of patients [<i>M</i> (<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>)] in group A at time points T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>5</sub> and T<sub>6</sub> was 6 (6, 6), 2 (2, 2), 3 (3, 4), 3 (2, 3), 2 (2, 3), 2 (1, 3) , 1 (0, 2), respectively, while the NRS score at aforementioned time points in group B was 6 (6, 6), 2 (1, 2), 3 (3, 4), 3 (2, 3), 2 (2, 3), 2 (1, 3), 1 (0, 2), respectively. Compared with preoperative NRS scores, NRS scores decreased in both groups at all postoperative time points (all <i>P</i><0.05). Compared with group A, the NRS scores of group B at time points T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>5</sub>, and T<sub>6</sub> decreased more significantly, with statistically significant differences (all <i>P</i><0.05). The dose of gabapentin in group A [<i>M</i> (<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>)] was 0.6 (0.6, 0.6), 0.3 (0.3, 0.6), 0.3 (0.0, 0.3) and 0.0 (0.0, 0.3) mg/d at time points T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>5</sub>, and T<sub>6</sub>, respectively, and 0.6 (0.6, 0.6), 0.3 (0.2, 0.3), 0.0 (0.0, 0.3) 0.0 (0.0, 0.0) mg/d in patients in group B, respectively. Compared with the preoperative period, the doses of gabapentin taken by patients in both groups reduced significantly at all postoperative time points (all <i>P</i><0.05). Moreover, compared with group A, the gabapentin dose in group B decreased more significantly at time points T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>5</sub>, and T<sub>6</sub>, with statistically significant differences (all <i>P</i><0.05). The incidence of clinically significant PHN was 25.0% (17/68) and 7.1% (3/42) in groups A and B, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.018). No serious adverse effects such as pneumothorax, spinal cord injury and hematoma were observed during the treatment period in both groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Pulsed radiofrequency of dorsal root ganglion combined with ozone injection is safer and more effective for the treatment of acute phase herpes zoster neuralgia in the neck and upper extremities, and it can reduce the incidence of clinically significant PHN, with high safety profile."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "R X", "Initials": "RX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "K Y", "Initials": "KY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pain Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81901124", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "LY20H090020, LGF20H090021", "Agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019\u2011ss\u2011ttyx", "Agency": "Key Disciplines Jointly Established by Province and Cities in Zhejiang Province-Pain Medicine", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7511141", "ISSNLinking": "0376-2491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "6CW7F3G59X", "NameOfSubstance": "Gabapentin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gabapentin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ganglia, Spinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Herpes Zoster"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neuralgia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neuralgia, Postherpetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Upper Extremity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "20"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36800773", "10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20220624-01391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
