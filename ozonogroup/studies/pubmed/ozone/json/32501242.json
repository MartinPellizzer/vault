The effect of several experimental parameters was investigated considering, the initial DMP concentration, ozone flow, the type of soil (sand and agricultural soil) and the presence of \u03b1-FeOOH as a potential catalyst in the reaction system with sand. The elimination of DMP using ozone is significantly affected by the type of soil. In the case of sand, conventional ozonation was capable to degrade 74% of the initial DMP concentration (0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>) after 8\u00a0h of the reaction, however, the mineralization degree was below 50%. Under the same experimental conditions, the complete elimination of DMP was achieved when calcined agricultural soil was present reaching a 70% of mineralization. The presence of metal oxides in calcined agricultural soil combined with ozone produced oxidants species which were responsible of incrementing the mineralization degree (around 20% in comparison with the sand). The toxicity tests on lettuce seed demonstrated lower toxicity of DMP byproducts after ozonation. The DMP high removal efficiencies and the lower toxicity of generated byproducts in soil prove the applicability of ozone treatment for soil remediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
