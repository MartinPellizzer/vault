Exposure to six ambient pollutants, including PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3,</sub> was assessed by extracting daily concentrations from validated 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km pollutant grids at each subject's residential address. A conditional logistic regression approach was used to explore the exposure-response relationship with adjustment for temperature and relative humidity. We calculated the Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) and the attributable deaths number of CIHD.", "An increase of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with a 1.16% (95% CI: 0.85-1.48%) and 1.80% (1.36-2.24%) increase in CIHD mortality, respectively. A threshold value of 123\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> was identified for the association between O<sub>3</sub> exposure and CIHD mortality. Controlling for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, each increase of 10\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> in O<sub>3</sub> (>threshold) was statistically significantly associated with a 0.94% (0.19-1.71%) increase in CIHD mortality, however there was no association between NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO exposure and CIHD mortality. Reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> to the WHO air quality guidelines would prevent 6.16% (95% CI: 4.70-7.58%), 4.30% (3.18-5.43%) and 1.29% (0.48-4.20%) of CIHD deaths, respectively.
