The application is to the nitrogen-broadened half-width of the 500.4-GHz transition (34(2 32)<--34(1 33)) of the ground vibrational state of ozone. For each state of the perturber, the optical cross sections are determined at a number of velocities with the intermolecular potential taken as a sum of electrostatic contributions and Lennard-Jones (6-12) atom-atom components. The dynamics of the collision process are correct to second order in time. Using a nonlinear least-squares fitting method, the optical cross sections are fit to a double power law, which allows the velocity integral for the half-width to be done analytically. The results are compared with the mean relative thermal velocity complex Robert-Bonamy calculations and with measurement. The temperature dependence of the half-width, which is necessary for reduction of remotely sensed data, is determined from both methods and compared with experiment.
