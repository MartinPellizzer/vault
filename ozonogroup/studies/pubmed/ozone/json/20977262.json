Continuous measurements of ozone (O\u2083), sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), carbonmonoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM\u2082.\u2085), and meteorological data were also available. A principle components analysis (PCA) of 3886 observations of 13 variables for the period identified six major factors. Melting snow was observed to be a source of Hg\u2070in winters. Positive correlations between RGM and O\u2083 in the spring and summer may be indicative of Hg\u2070 oxidation. RGM concentrations increased simultaneously with SO\u2082 suggesting the influence of coal fired power plants (CFPP). The \ufb01fth factor (F5) containing O\u2083 (high negative loading), CO (positive loading), Hg\u2070 and Hg(p) (positive), and/or RGM (negative) was identified as a mobile source which was usually observed during morning rush hours (6:00-9:00 a.m.). The concentrations of the three mercury species from the direction of the CFPP were significantly reduced following the shutdown of this source."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York 13699-5712, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jiaoyan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyun-Deok", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hopke", "ForeName": "Philip K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holsen", "ForeName": "Thomas M", "Initials": "TM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXS1BY2PGL", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercury"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mercury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New York"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Power Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20977262", "10.1021/es102744j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
