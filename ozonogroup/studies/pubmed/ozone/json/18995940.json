It shows that RYL for rice in Chongqing from 1990 to 1995 was 1.1-5.8% and would reach 10.8% in 2020, while for winter wheat it was estimated to be 0.2-9.8% in 1990 and would reach around 12.0% in 2020. In the YRD, RYL for rice was 2.5-6.6% from 1990 to 1999 and would reach 9.2% in 2020, while for winter wheat, RYL was estimated to be 7.1-8.4% based on simulated O3 dosages, while based on monitored O3 dosages, it had surpassed 8.4% and reached about 12.0% in 1999."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaoke", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yongguan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18995940", "10.1016/j.envpol.2008.09.012", "S0269-7491(08)00475-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
