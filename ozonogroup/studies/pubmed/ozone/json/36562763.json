Nevertheless, the lack of kinetic studies at higher temperatures for their reactions with other radicals such as OH has precluded the inclusion of this class of reactions in detailed kinetics models developed for combustion applications. In this work, guided by the limited room-temperature experimental studies on selected alkyl-peroxy radicals and literature theoretical kinetics on the prototypical CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + OH system, we have performed parametric studies on the effect of uncertainties in the rate coefficients and branching ratios to potential product channels for RO<sub>2</sub> + OH reactions at higher temperatures. Literature kinetics models were used to simulate autoignition delays, laminar flame speeds, and speciation profiles in flow and stirred reactors for a variety of common combustion-relevant fuels. Inclusion of RO<sub>2</sub> + OH reactions was found to retard autoignition in fuel-lean (\u03c6 = 0.5) mixtures of ethane and dimethyl ether in air. The observed effects were noticeably more pronounced in ozone-enriched combustion of ethane and dimethyl ether. The simulations also examined the influence of ozone doping levels, pressures, and equivalence ratios for both ethane and dimethyl ether oxidation. Sensitivity and flux analyses revealed that the RO<sub>2</sub> + OH reaction is a significant sink of RO<sub>2</sub> radicals at the early stage of autoignition, affecting fuel oxidation through RO<sub>2</sub> \u2194 QOOH, RO<sub>2</sub> \u2194 alkene + HO<sub>2</sub>, or RO<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> \u2194 ROOH + O<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, the kinetic stability of the trioxide formed from RO<sub>2</sub> + OH reactions was investigated using master equation analyses. Last, we discuss other bimolecular reactions that are missing in literature kinetics models but are relevant to hydrocarbon oxidation initiated by external radical sources (plasma-enhanced, ozone-enriched combustion, etc.). The present simulations provide a strong motivation for better characterizing the bimolecular kinetics of peroxy radicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences & Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Jaeyoung", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4256-1311"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences & Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Mulvihill", "ForeName": "Clayton R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6297-9187"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences & Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Klippenstein", "ForeName": "Stephen J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1867-1254"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences & Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States."}], "LastName": "Sivaramakrishnan", "ForeName": "Raghu", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36562763", "10.1021/acs.jpca.2c06960"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
