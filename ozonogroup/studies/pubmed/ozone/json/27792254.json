Previous studies of nonthermal plasma agents did not investigate the role of a microbial inactivation agent without interference from other agents. Consequently, the exact mechanism underlying their activity remains unclear. The present experiment was conducted to study the mechanism underlying Escherichia coli inactivation by nonthermal plasma.", "The mechanism underlying E.\u00a0coli inactivation by charged particles was studied using pure argon plasma. Results showed that cell wall damage owing to strong electrostatic forces did not occur during direct current (DC) plasma treatment with Ar or N<sub>2</sub> . Next, the inactivation effects of excited N2\u2217, N2+, ozone, OH radicals, and nitric oxide were investigated using pure nitrogen plasma and air plasma. Morphological changes and cell rupture of E.\u00a0coli were observed after 5\u00a0min of treatment with nonthermal plasma in air, but not with argon and nitrogen plasma treatments.", "Our data demonstrate that reactive oxygen species play an essential role in the inactivation of E.\u00a0coli.", "A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying nonthermal plasma's inactivation of micro-organism is essential for the practical applications of nonthermal plasma techniques."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Science, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasma Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67XQY1V3KH", "NameOfSubstance": "Argon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Argon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasma Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27792254", "10.1111/jam.13335"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
