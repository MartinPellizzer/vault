Despite treatment with ozone, unembryonated T. canis eggs could develop into viable second-stage larvae when assayed by larvae recovery after oral inoculation into mice. The viability of second stage larvae of T. canis was also not affected by ozone treatment. No significant difference was observed in the larvae recovery count and migratory pattern of the ozone-treated larvae and the untreated control because the majority of the larvae were recovered from the liver and lungs on day 2 postinoculation. However, scanning electron microscopy of the ozone treated T. canis eggs showed many blebs on the surface of the protein coat at the basement of the honeycomb-like structures. The honeycomb-like structures on the egg surface were also observed to be distorted after ozone treatment. Thus, in spite of inducing some surface morphological changes on the egg, ozone was observed to have no effect on the viability of the embryonated second stage larvae of T. canis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ooi", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Vet Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9105360", "ISSNLinking": "0916-7250"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Toxocara canis"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxocariasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9524939", "10.1292/jvms.60.169"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
