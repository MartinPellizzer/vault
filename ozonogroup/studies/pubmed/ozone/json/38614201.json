However, research on the relationship between long-term air pollution exposure and PP has been relatively limited. We thus investigated the association between long-term air pollution exposure and the onset of PP in South Korea.", "We investigated a retrospective cohort using the Korea National Health Insurance Database. Six-year-old children born from 2007 to 2009 were examined (2013-2015). We included boys \u226410 years and girls aged \u22649 years who visited hospitals for early pubertal development, were diagnosed with PP per the ICD-10 (E228, E301, and E309), and received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. We analyzed data for boys up until 10 years old (60-month follow-up) and for girls up to 9 years old (48-month follow-up). We assessed the association between long-term air pollution exposure and the onset of PP using a Cox proportional hazard model. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) and per 1\u00a0ppb increase in sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).", "This study included 1,205,784 children aged six years old between 2013 and 2015. A positive association was found between the 48-month moving average PM<sub>2.5</sub> (HR: 1.019; 95% CI: 1.012, 1.027), PM<sub>10</sub> (HR: 1.009; 95% CI: 1.006, 1.013), SO<sub>2</sub> (HR: 1.037; 95% CI: 1.018, 1.055), and O<sub>3</sub> (HR: 1.006; 95% CI: 1.001, 1.010) exposure and PP in girls but not boys.", "This study provides valuable insights into the harmful effects of air pollution during childhood and adolescence, emphasizing that air pollution is a risk factor that should be managed and reduced."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
