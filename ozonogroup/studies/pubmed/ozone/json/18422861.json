This study investigates the relationship of modeled and measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels with age-standardized incidence rates of breast cancer in 107 countries. The hypothesis being tested is that breast cancer incidence is inversely related to geographically-dependent cutaneous sunlight exposure. A multiple regression approach was used to examine the contributions of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance to age-standardized incidence rates of breast cancer in the 107 countries with data on these covariates-total column ozone thickness, per capita intake of alcohol and energy from animal and vegetable sources, cigarettes, proportion of female population overweight, and total fertility. Age-standardized incidence rates were substantially higher at latitudes distant from the equator (R2 = 0.43, p < 0.0001). The dose-response gradient between modeled serum 25(OH)D levels and incidence rates of breast cancer followed a standard inverse dose-response curve. Increasing increments in serum 25(OH)D in the range above 22 ng/mL were associated with incrementally lower incidence rates of breast cancer. According to multiple regression, UVB irradiance adjusted for cloud cover was inversely associated with incidence rates (p = 0.04) after controlling for covariates. Intake of energy from animal sources was also positively associated with incidence rates (p < 0.01). The overall coefficient of determination, R2, was 0.81 (p < 0.0001). There was a protective effect of UVB irradiance on risk of breast cancer that was independent of fertility rate, proportion of the population overweight, alcohol intake, animal energy intake, and other covariates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0631, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohr", "ForeName": "Sharif B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garland", "ForeName": "Cedric F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorham", "ForeName": "Edward D", "Initials": "ED"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "William B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garland", "ForeName": "Frank C", "Initials": "FC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Breast J", "NlmUniqueID": "9505539", "ISSNLinking": "1075-122X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A288AR3C9H", "NameOfSubstance": "25-hydroxyvitamin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18422861", "10.1111/j.1524-4741.2008.00571.x", "TBJ571"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
