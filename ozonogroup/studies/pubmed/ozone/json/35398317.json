Here, the autoxidation of oleic acid was explored using microdroplet mass spectrometry. Bulk solution, concentration and solvent composition experiments provided direct evidences for that the autoxidation occurred at or near the air-water interface. The kinetic data showed an acceleration at this interface and was comparable to ozonation, indicating that autoxidation is an important pathway for SOAs formation. In addition, intermediates/products were captured and identified using tandem mass spectrometry, spin-trapping and quenched agents. The autoxidation mechanism was divided into addition intermediates (AIs) and Criegee intermediates (CIs) pathways mediated by hydroxyl radicals (OH). The CI chemistry which is ubiquitous in gas phase was observed at the air-water interface, and this leaded to the mass/volume loss of aerosols. Inversely, the AI chemistry caused the increase of mass, density and hygroscopicity of aerosols. AI chemistry was dominated compared to CI chemistry, but varied by concerning aerosol sizes, ultraviolet light (UV) and charge. Moreover, the MS approach of selectively probing the interfacial substances at the scale of sub-seconds opens new opportunities to study heterogeneous chemistry in atmosphere."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
