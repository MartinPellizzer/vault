For that cause, indoor and outdoor observation data were retrieved from the HEALS EDMS database, and more specifically the data from the OFFICAIR and the SINPHONIE EU projects. The I/O ratios were produced and were statistically analyzed in order to be able to study the influence of the indoor environment against the pollutants coming from outdoors. The present statistical approach highlighted also the differences of I/O ratios between the two studied microenvironments for each pollutant. For exposure estimation to the above-mentioned pollutants, the probability and cumulative distribution function (pdf/cdf) empirical approximations led to the conclusion that for offices the I/O ratios of PM<sub>2.5</sub> follow a normal distribution, while NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> a gamma distribution. Respectively, for schools the I/O ratios of all pollutants follow a lognormal distribution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
