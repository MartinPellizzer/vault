The regulatory process provides for the development of a state implementation plan that includes a demonstration that the projected future O3 concentrations will be at or below the NAAQS based on photochemical modeling and analytical techniques. In this study, four photochemical modeling systems, based on two photochemical models, Community Model for Air Quality and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions, and two emissions processing models, Sparse Matrix Optimization Kernel for Emissions and Emissions Modeling System, were applied to the eastern United States, with emphasis on the northeastern Ozone Transport Region in terms of their response to oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic carbon-focused controls on the estimated design values. With the 8-hr O3 NAAQS set as a bright-line test, it was found that a given area could be termed as being in or out of attainment of the NAAQS depending upon the modeling system. This suggests the need to provide an estimate of model-to-model uncertainty in the relative reduction factor (RRF) for a better understanding of the uncertainty in projecting the status of an area's attainment. Results indicate that the model-to-model differences considered in this study introduce"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Albany, New York 12233, USA. gsistla@dec.state.ny.us"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sistla", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hogrefe", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zalewsky", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henry", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Civerolo", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guideline Adherence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15373363", "10.1080/10473289.2004.10470964"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
