The potential benefits of new therapy with Ozonline\u00ae for periodontal treatment, include improved patient compliance and an easier access to periodontal pocket. The objective of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ozonline\u00ae in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in adult patients. A randomized controlled split-mouth study was carried out in ten patients (5 men and 5 women age 42-73 mean 55 \u00b17) with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. None of these patients received any surgical or non-surgical periodontal therapy and demonstrated radiographic evidence of moderate bone loss. The mouth has been divided into upper right and left quadrants. The upper and lower right quadrants were treated with ultrasonic scaler, the left quadrants with ultrasonic scaler with ozonated water (Ozonline\u00ae). 10 microbiological samples were collected from upper left quadrants and 10 from upper right quadrants from each patient. Microbiological samples were collected from the sites of the patients at baseline and at the 7th day. 20 localized chronic periodontitis sites were selected (10 in left quadrants and 10 in right quadrants). After the treatment with Ozonline\u00ae, a remarkable decrease in bacteria amount, both for some species and for the total count was observed in the left quadrants respect to right ones. Specifically, <i>T. forsythia</i> and <i>T. denticola</i> were eradicated whereas Total Bacteria Loading and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> showed a reduction of 38% and 55%, respect to right quadrants. Our study demonstrated the efficacy of the Ozonline\u00ae in the management of moderate to severe chronic periodontitis. ."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Private Practice, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Piva", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Private Practice, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Avantaggiato", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Candotto", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicina, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pellati", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Centre of Neuroscience of Milan, University of Milan-Bicocca, 20900 Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Moreo", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Observational Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Scaling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Hygiene"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontal Pocket"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32618165", "11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
