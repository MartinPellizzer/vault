UV, ozone and high pressure are non-thermal processing technologies that have potential to inactivate human pathogens on produce and allow the retention of fresh-like organoleptic properties. The objective of this study was to determine if UV, ozone, and high pressure are effective technologies compared to traditional chlorine spray on green onions to reduce enteric viral pathogens and to determine the effect of location of the virus (surface or internalized) on the efficacy of these processes. Mature green onion plants were inoculated with murine norovirus (MNV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and human adenovirus type 41 (Ad41) either on the surface through spot inoculation or through inoculating contaminated hydroponic solution allowing for uptake of the virus into the internal tissues. Inoculated green onions were treated with UV (240 mJ s/cm(2)), ozone (6.25 ppm for 10 min), pressure (500 MPa, for 5 min at 20\u00b0C), or sprayed with calcium hypochlorite (150 ppm, 4\u00b0C). Viral inactivation was determined by comparing treated and untreated inoculated plants using cell culture infectivity assays. Processing treatments were observed to greatly affect viral inactivation. Viral inactivation for all three viruses was greatest after pressure treatment and the lowest inactivation was observed after chlorine and UV treatment. Both surface inoculated viruses and viruses internalized in green onions were inactivated to some extent by these post-harvest processing treatments. These results suggest that ozone and high pressure processes aimed to reduce the level of microbial contamination of produce have the ability to inactivate viruses if they become localized in the interior portions of produce."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Food Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirneisen", "ForeName": "Kirsten A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kniel", "ForeName": "Kalmia E", "Initials": "KE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8412849", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11DXB629VZ", "NameOfSubstance": "calcium hypochlorite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Decontamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Inactivation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Internalization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Viruses"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23973828", "10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.07.013", "S0168-1605(13)00348-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
