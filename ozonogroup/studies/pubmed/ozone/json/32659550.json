High doses of each of these gases or a mixture can change the physical and chemical properties of the lung membrane, thus leading to an increased pulmonary vascular permeability and structural failure of the alveolar cell membrane. In the present study, detailed molecular dynamic (MD) modeling was applied to investigate the effects of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and mixtures of these gases on the dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipid bilayer. The results showed that several key physical properties, including the mass density, lipid ordering parameter, lipid diffusion, and electrostatic potential of the cell membrane, have been changed by the binding of different compounds. This resulted in significant variations and more disorder in the DPPC bilayer. The multiple analyses of membrane properties proved the toxicity of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> to the DPPC bilayer, providing a theoretical basis for the experimental phenomenon that SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> can cause lung cell apoptosis. For the single systems, the damage to DPPC bilayer caused by O<sub>3</sub> was more serious than NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. More importantly, the MD simulations using the mixtures of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> showed a much greater decline of membrane fluidity and the aggravation of membrane damage than the single systems, indicating a synergistic effect when NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> coexisted in the atmosphere, which could lead to much more severe damage and greater toxicities to the lung."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
