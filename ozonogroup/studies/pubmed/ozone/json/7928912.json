The purpose of this study was to identify a mathematical model that described ozone-induced mean decrements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) as a function of exposure rate (C x VE) and total inhaled dose (C x VE x T). Three hundred seventy-four young male nonsmokers participated in 504 exposures to several concentrations of ozone for 2 or 6.6 h. Mean percent change in FEV1 was calculated for each hour of exposure and was fit to the exposure variables by use of nonlinear models. We identified a general sigmoid-shaped model that well described the observed mean response in terms of exposure rate and total inhaled dose over a wide range of C and T. By fixing the value of a single parameter, this model reduces to a simpler form, which was adequate for description of responses over narrower ranges of exposure conditions. We concluded that the observed mean responses to short-term ozone exposure were adequately described by the nonlinear models identified in this study and that models of this form may be useful for description of responses over a wide range of C and T."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Branch, Health Effects Research Laboratory, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park 27711."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonnell", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Physiol (1985)", "NlmUniqueID": "8502536", "ISSNLinking": "0161-7567"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Inhalation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forced Expiratory Volume"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Exertion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Mechanics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7928912", "10.1152/jappl.1994.76.6.2776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
