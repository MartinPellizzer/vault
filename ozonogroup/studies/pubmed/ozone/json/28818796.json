Solid reduction, biomass lysis and biomethane production were used as essential parameters to assess the potential of DOP over ozone pretreatment (OP). A higher suspended solid reduction of about 25.2% was achieved in DOP than OP 18%. The ozone dosage of 0.014gO<sub>3</sub>/g SS supported a maximal biomass lysis of about 32.8% when the biosolids were subjected to prior dispersion at 30s and 3000rpm. However, the same ozone dosage without phase separation achieved 9.6% biomass lysis. The second exponential model results of the biomethane assay showed that DOP enhanced the accessibility of disintegrated biosolids for methane production and induced about 1150mL/g VS of methane production. The energy analysis reveals that DOP provides significant amount of positive net energy (152.65kWh/ton) when compared to OP (-12.42kWh/ton)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
