The inactivation/growth curves were modeled and the biological parameters estimated, with yeast used as the target microorganism. Regardless of the acid added, potassium sorbate showed a general inactivation effect on yeasts in the products prepared from both FF and SE Sodium benzoate had a rapid inactivation effect with FF, but with SF, it was effective only in the presence of acetic acid. A strain of Issatchenkia occidentalis was found that was resistant to the combination of this preservative with citric or lactic acids. In FF, ozone showed an initial marked inhibition against yeasts, but later, yeasts were again able to grow. In SF, ozone was a strong inactivating agent when it replaced any of the traditional preservatives. Lactic acid bacteria were always absent in products prepared from FF, and apparently were not affected by the different preservative agents in those prepared from SF. The behavior of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria populations in commercial products were similar to those found in experimental treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Biotechnology, Instituto de la Grasa, Seville, Spain. fnarroyo@cica.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arroyo L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dur\u00e1n Quintana", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garrido Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OJ245FE5EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Benzoate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X045WJ989B", "NameOfSubstance": "Sorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Olea"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Benzoate"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Yeasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16786857", "10.4315/0362-028x-69.6.1354", "S0362-028X(22)07459-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
