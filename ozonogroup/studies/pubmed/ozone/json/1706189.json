Rat alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI)2 was purified from blood plasma, and antibodies to this inhibitor were prepared. The activity of alpha 1-PI in lung lavage fluids from rats was measured by elastase inhibition, and the immunological concentration of alpha 1-PI was quantified in an enzyme-linked immunoassay. The ratio of the amount of active alpha 1-PI relative to its immunological concentration was examined as a measure of the inhibitor's functional activity. This ratio and the ratio of the immunological concentration of alpha 1-PI to the total protein concentration were determined in lung lavage fluids from rats exposed to air, 10 parts per million (ppm) nitrogen dioxide, and diesel emissions (3.5 mg/m3 particulates) for 12, 18, and 24 months. Only diesel exposures resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the functional activity of alpha 1-PI of 30 percent (p less than 0.05). Similar studies were performed on rats exposed to nitrogen dioxide (0.5 ppm background with peaks of 1.5 ppm) and ozone (0.06 ppm background with peaks of 0.25 ppm) for 12 and 18 months. No statistically significant effects were observed in the functional activity of alpha 1-PI or its immunological concentration. In other protocols, rats were acutely exposed to 0.8 ppm or 1.2 ppm ozone for two, four, or eight hours, and to 0.5 ppm or 0.8 ppm ozone in conjunction with 8 percent carbon dioxide for two or seven hours. Although these acute exposure conditions did not reduce the functional activity of alpha 1-PI, the immunological concentration of alpha 1-PI and the elastase inhibitory activity, relative to other proteins, were significantly increased in relation to the total amount of ozone inhaled. The functional activity of alpha 1-PI also was measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of human subjects exposed to nitrogen dioxide (0.05 ppm with 2 ppm peaks, or to 1.5 ppm continuously) for three hours and to ozone (0.4 ppm) for two hours during exercise. These exposures did not result in significant changes in the functional activity of alpha 1-PI or its immunological concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, James H.
