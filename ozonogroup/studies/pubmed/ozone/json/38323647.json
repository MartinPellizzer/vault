Many oxidants can inactivate viruses, and this study aims to systematically compare the disinfection effects of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) on MS2 coliphage. The effects of oxidant dose and contact time on disinfection were explored, as were the disinfection effects of three oxidizing agents in secondary effluent. The 4-log inactivation of MS2 coliphage required 0.05 mM O<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 mM PMS, or 25 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with a contact time of 30 min. All three oxidants achieved at least 4-log disinfection within 30 min, and O<sub>3</sub> required only 0.5 min. In secondary effluent, all three oxidants also achieved 4-log inactivation of MS2 coliphage. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) results indicate that all three oxidants removed dissolved organic matter synchronously and O<sub>3</sub> oxidized dissolved organic matter more thoroughly while maintaining disinfection efficacy. Considering the criteria of oxidant dose, contact time, and disinfection efficacy in secondary effluent, O<sub>3</sub> is the best choice for MS2 coliphage disinfection among the three oxidants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for Urban Water Recycling and Environmental Safety, Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China. penglu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zi-Chen", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for Urban Water Recycling and Environmental Safety, Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China. penglu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-Long", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for Urban Water Recycling and Environmental Safety, Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China. penglu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Zi-Bo", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Microorganism Application and Risk Control of Shenzhen, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center for Urban Water Recycling and Environmental Safety, Institute of Environment and Ecology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China. penglu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yi-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSCEC Scimee Sci.&Tech.
