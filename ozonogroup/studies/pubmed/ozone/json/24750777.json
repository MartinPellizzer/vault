The molecular weight of native hyaluronic acid was reduced from 1535 to 87 kDa for 120 min at 40\u00b0C. The rate of reduction of molecular weight was 94.33%. The FT-IR, 13C NMR, and UV-vis spectra suggested that there was no obvious modification of chemical structure of low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid. The use of degradation of native hyaluronic acid by ozone treatment can be a useful alternative for production of low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
