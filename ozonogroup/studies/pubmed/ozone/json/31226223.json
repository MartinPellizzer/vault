Postharvest decay reduces chestnut shelf life and can cause severe economic losses. In this study we investigated the effect of ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) gaseous treatment on chestnut rot caused by Gnomoniopsis castanea and the quality parameters of chestnuts.", "The results showed that ozone treatment (150\u2009ppb during the day, and 300\u2009ppb during the night) reduced the decay of chestnuts and had a fungistatic effect on isolates of G. castanea. The exposure of chestnuts to ozone did not alter weight losses, sugar content and titratable acidity. The concentration of total phenolics decreased during the storage period, both for treated and untreated nuts. However, after 150\u2009days of treatment the polyphenol content of the chestnuts exposed to ozone was significantly higher than in control nuts.", "Our results suggested that ozone is an appropriate and economical tool to maximize the quality of chestnut shelf life, enabling it to be stored for long periods. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DIBAF, University of Tuscia, Via S.
