Safe, efficient, and economical O<sub>3</sub> removal methods urgently need to be developed. Catalytic decomposition is the most promising method for O<sub>3</sub> removal, especially at room temperature or even subzero temperatures. Great efforts have been made to develop high-efficiency catalysts for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition that can operate at low temperatures, high space velocity and high humidity. First, this review describes the general reaction mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> decomposition on noble metal and transition metal oxide catalysts. Then, progress on the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition performance of various catalysts in the past 30 years is summarized in detail. The main focus is the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition performance of manganese oxides, which are divided into supported manganese oxides and non-supported manganese oxides. Methods to improve the activity, stability, and humidity resistance of manganese oxide catalysts for O<sub>3</sub> decomposition are also summarized. The deactivation mechanisms of manganese oxides under dry and humid conditions are discussed. The O<sub>3</sub> decomposition performance of monolithic catalysts is also summarized from the perspective of industrial applications. Finally, the future development directions and prospects of O<sub>3</sub> catalytic decomposition technology are put forward."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
