We applied a deep convolutional neural network and Shapely additive explanation (SHAP) to examine the complex underlying nonlinearity between variations of surface ozone and meteorological factors. Results of the models showed that between 2000 and 2019, specific humidity (38% and 27%) and temperature (28% and 37%) contributed the most to ozone formation over the Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas, respectively. On the other hand, the results show that solar radiation (50%) strongly impacted ozone variation over West Texas during this time. Using a combination of the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter and multiple linear regression, we also evaluated the influence of meteorology on ozone and quantified the contributions of meteorological parameters to trends in surface ozone formation. Our findings showed that in Houston and Dallas, meteorology influenced ozone variations to a large extent. The impacts of meteorology on West Texas, however, showed meteorological factors had fewer influences on ozone variabilities from 2000 to 2019. This study showed that SHAP analysis and the KZ approach can investigate the contributions of the meteorological factors on ozone concentrations and help policymakers enact effective ozone mitigation policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
