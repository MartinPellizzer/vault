A series of lab-scale experiments was conducted to select a suitable catalyst and its proper dose to achieve optimum sludge reduction. Using a central composite design under response surface methodology (RSM), system optimization with respect to sludge reduction and cost-effectiveness was performed by varying the independent parameters: dosages of ozone and ions. Five metal ions, Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, CU2+, and Al3+1, were tested, and the manganese ion showed the highest sludge reduction, as measured by a decrease in total suspended solids. The ozone/Mn combination achieved approximately twice as much sludge reduction as the ozonation alone. Furthermore, the Mn dose of 10 mg/g-TS (total solids) resulted in the highest sludge reduction efficiency among the different doses, which ranged from 0 to 20 mg-Mn/g-TS. The predicted efficiency of sewage sludge reduction using the RSM was found to agree well with the experimental results, and the statistical analyses predicted optimum ranges for the doses of ozone and Mn ions, taking into account the overall cost for sewage sludge treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Architectural Civil & Environmental Engineering, Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Centre for Environmental Studies, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 449-701, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9884939", "ISSNLinking": "0959-3330"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20232674", "10.1080/09593330903283799"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
