Absolute changes in platelet mtDNA methylation (ACmtDNAm) levels were determined by two repeated measurements on platelet mtDNA methylation levels in blood samples collected before and after the 24-hour exposure period. A multivariable linear regression model and a generalized linear model with a Poisson link function were used to investigate the associations of ambient gaseous pollutants with platelet mtDNA methylation levels, STDE, and TIE, respectively.", "Short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was significantly associated with decreased ACmtDNAm at ATP6_P1 but increased ACmtDNAm at mt12sRNA, MT-COX1, and MT-COX1_P2; short-term CO and SO<sub>2</sub> exposures were significantly associated with decreased ACmtDNAm at D-loop, MT-COX3- and ATP-related genes. Moreover, short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of STDE and TIE, and ACmtDNAm at MT-COX1 and MT-COX1_P2 modified the association between short-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure and STDE events. L-Arg supplementation attenuated the effects of ambient gaseous pollutants, particularly O<sub>3</sub>, on ACmtDNAm and STDE.", "Platelet mtDNA methylation levels are promising biomarkers of short-term exposure to ambient gaseous air pollution, and are likely implicated in the mechanism behind the association of ambient O<sub>3</sub> pollution with adverse cardiovascular effects. L-Arg supplementation showed the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of ambient O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
