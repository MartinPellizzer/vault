Here, \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanowire with tunable K<sup>+</sup> concentration was prepared through a hydrothermal process in KOH solution. High concentration K<sup>+</sup> in the tunnel can expand crystal cell and break the charge balance, leading to a lower average oxidation state (AOS) of Mn, which means abundant oxygen vacancy. DFT calculation has also proven that the samples with higher K<sup>+</sup> concentration exhibit lower formation energy for oxygen vacancy. Due to the enormous active oxygen vacancies existing in the \u03b1-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanowire, the lifetime of the catalyst (corresponding to 100% ozone removal rate, 25 \u00b0C) is increased from 3 to 15 h. The FT-IR results confirmed that the accumulation of intermediate oxygen species on the catalyst surface is the main reason why it is deactivated after long time reaction. In this work, the performance of the catalyst has been improved because the abundant active oxygen vacancies are fabricated by the electrostatic interaction between oxygen atoms inside the tunnels and the introduced K<sup>+</sup>, which offers us a new perspective to design a high efficiency catalyst and may promote manganese oxide for practical ozone elimination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-6548-6262"], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Guoxiang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering , Beihang University , Beijing 100191 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-9318-6403"], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jinguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wenlu", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Wenqing", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zong", "ForeName": "Ruilong", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-8709-1907"], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yongfa", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Engineering , Beihang University , Beijing 100191 , China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qianfan", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29968461", "10.1021/acs.est.8b01594"]}}]}
