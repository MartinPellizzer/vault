After root canal preparation, the samples were sterilized and placed into eppendorf tubes with 1 mL brain heart infusion broth containing 1.5\u00d710(8) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of E. faecalis. The contaminated samples were then divided into four groups (n=15) according to the disinfection method used: Group 1, Saline (positive control); Group 2, NaOCl (negative control); Group 3, Gaseous O3; and Group 4, PAD. Three non-contaminated teeth were used to control the infection and sterilization process. The CFUs were counted and the data were analyzed statistically.", "There was a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups (P<0.05). The saline group had the highest number of remaining microorganisms. Complete sterilization was achieved in the 2.5% NaOCl group. There were no statistically differences between PAD and gaseous O3 (P>0.05).", "Both PAD and gaseous O3 have a significant antibacterial effect on infected root canals. However, 2.5% NaOCl was superior in terms of its antimicrobial abilities compared with the other disinfection procedures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Akdeniz University, Konyaalti, Antalya, 07070, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Tuncay", "ForeName": "\u00d6", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Din\u00e7er", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ku\u015ftarc\u0131", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Er", "ForeName": "\u00d6", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Din\u00e7", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Demirbuga", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DY38VHM5OD", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Irrigants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Preparation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hypochlorite"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26289524", "10.4103/1119-3077.163289", "NigerJClinPract_2015_18_6_814_163289"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
