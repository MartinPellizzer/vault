At lumbar level, the natural history of herniated disc is characterized by a disappearance of clinical symptoms in up to 60% with conservative treatment through simple rest for about 6 weeks and reduction of the disk heniation revealed by CT or MR scans within eight to nine months after the onset of back pain. Surgery is considered the treatment of choice for extruded, migrated and free fragment herniated disk associated to clinical symptomatology of cono-cauda syndrome, progressive foot droop and hyperalgic radiculopathy. patients with a small or contained herniated disk, without any benefit from conservative medical treatment, can be candidates for one of minimally invasive percutaneous techniques, whose outcome, though, depends on the characteristics of hernia itself and on the chosen technique. The aim of this paper is to discuss about O2-O3 treatment for symptomatic not extruded herniated disk at lumbar level, highlighting about indication inclusion exclusion criteria and our results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroradiology Service Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Della Gatta", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroradiology Service Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Guarnieri", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroradiology Service Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ambrosanio", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroradiology Service Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Capobianco", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroradiology Service Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Muto", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluoroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Intervertebral Disc Displacement"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Low Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Lumbar Vertebrae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33176413", "2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
