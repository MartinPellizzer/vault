As a consequence of photochemical processes, the ozone levels in the atmosphere of Mexico City are generally higher (mean of 0.325 ppm; period between 1987-1992) and may be harmful to health. Sixty two volunteers (medical doctors), aged 27-32 years, were divided into three groups. Group A was composed of those persons (17) who had never lived in Mexico City; a second group (B) (21) had recently arrived in Mexico City (1-8 days); and a third group (C) (24) who had permanently resided in Mexico City. Serum was obtained from fresh whole blood. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive materials were higher in group B while chromolipids and the serum inhibitory capacity (for lipoperoxidation) was higher in group C. The acute exposure to pollutants in group B apparently may have induced SOD as an antioxidant defense and was responsible for the increased level of TBA reactive material. In group C, the significant finding is better antioxidative defenses and slightly higher chromolipids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unidad de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica en Biogu\u00edmica, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro M\u00e9dico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, M\u00e9xico, D.F."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hicks", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Medina-Navarro", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guzman-Grenfell", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wacher", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lifshitz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9312706", "ISSNLinking": "0188-4409"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8696056"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
