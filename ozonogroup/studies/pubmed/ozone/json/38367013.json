However, its impact on stomatal opening and closure during dehydration and rehydration remains relatively unexplored and is still debated. Exogenous ethylene has been proven to induce stomatal closure through a series of signaling pathways, including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), subsequent synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1) activation. Thus, it has been suggested that ethylene might function to induce stomatal closure synergistically with abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, it has also been shown that increased ethylene can inhibit ABA- and jasmonic acid (JA)-induced stomatal closure, thus hindering drought-induced closure during dehydration. Simultaneously, other stresses, such as chilling, ozone pollution and K+ deficiency, inhibit drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure through an ethylene synthesis dependent way. However, ethylene has been shown to take on an opposing role during rehydration, preventing stomatal opening in the absence of ABA through its own signaling pathway. These findings offer novel insights into the function of ethylene in stomatal regulation during dehydration and rehydration, gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ethylene-induced stomatal movement in seed plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
