Quantifying each impact of aerosols on ozone in all seasons is urgent for the worsening ozone pollution in the improved aerosol air quality. In this study, we focused on the impact of aerosols on ozone via influencing photolysis rates. The air pollutants were simulated over the Central East China (CEC) in 2018 by using the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. By implementing emissions with base years of 2014 and 2018, we quantified the increase in ozone (\u0394Ozone_photolysis) caused by the decreasing aerosol concentrations (\u0394PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by influencing photolysis rates over the BTH region in all seasons. Furthermore, combined with the ozone observations, the contribution of \u0394Ozone_photolysis to the total changes in ozone (\u0394Ozone_total) in all seasons was quantitatively discussed. Our results showed that \u0394PM<sub>2.5</sub> showed obvious seasonal variations, which PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased more significantly in winter and autumn than in spring and summer, although significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions were observed in all seasons. Consistent seasonal variations were also observed in \u0394Ozone_photolysis, and the mean increases reached 5.5 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>, 2.6 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>, 1.2 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup>, and 1.4 \u03bcg m<sup>-3</sup> in winter, autumn, spring, spring, and summer, respectively. Compared with \u0394Ozone_total, \u0394Ozone_photolysis accounted for 36.3%, 17.2%, 3.5% and 10.6% of \u0394Ozone_total in winter, autumn, spring, and summer, respectively, suggesting that \u0394Ozone_photolysis was not the primary contributor to the current changes in ozone over the BTH region. However, the 36.3% contribution to \u0394Ozone_total in winter suggested that \u0394Ozone_photolysis is still an important contributor and should not be ignored when discussing the formation of high ozone episodes occurring in winter."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
