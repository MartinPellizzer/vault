MAFLD and subtypes, including overweight/obesity, lean, and diabetes MAFLD, were diagnosed according to clinical guidelines. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, organic matter (OM), black carbon (BC), PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and CO were estimated as a weighted average over participants' residential and work addresses for the three years preceding outcome assessment. Logistic regression and weighted quantile sum regression were used to estimate individual and joint effects of air pollutant mixture on presence of MAFLD.", "Overall prevalence of MAFLD was 26.6 % with overweight/obesity, lean, and diabetes MAFLD accounting for 92.0 %, 6.4 %, and 1.6 %, respectively. Exposure to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, BC, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>and CO was significantly associated with overall MAFLD, overweight/obesity MAFLD, or lean MAFLD in single pollutant models. Joint effects of air pollutant mixture were observed for overall MAFLD (OR = 1.10 [95 % CI: 1.03, 1.17]), overweight/obesity (1.09 [1.02, 1.15]), and lean MAFLD (1.63 [1.28, 2.07]). Contributions of individual air pollutants to joint effects were dominated by CO in overall and overweight/obesity MAFLD (Weights were 42.31 % and 45.87 %, respectively), while SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (36.34 %), SO<sub>2</sub> (21.00 %) and BC (12.38 %) were more important in lean MAFLD. Being male, aged above 45 years and smoking increased joint effects of air pollutant mixture on overall MAFLD.", "Air pollutant mixture was associated with MAFLD, particularly the lean MAFLD subtype. CO played a pivotal role in both overall and overweight/obesity MAFLD, whereas SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were associated with lean MAFLD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
