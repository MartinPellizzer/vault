This eco-friendly technology has a comprehendible adeptness in replacing alternative chemical sanitizers and is recognized as a generally safe disinfectant for fruits and vegetables. Several researchers have been focusing on the biochemical impacts of ozone on different quantitative and qualitative aspects of fruits and vegetables. A collection of those works is presented in this review highlighting the effect of ozone on the functional, antioxidant, and rheological properties of food. This can be a benevolent tool for discovering the processing states of ozone applications and ensuing influence on safety and quality attributes of previously studied foods and opening further research areas. It extends shelf life and never leaves any harmful residues on the product since it decomposes to form oxygen. It was seen that the impact on a specific property of food was dependent on the ozone concentration and treatment time, and the adverse effects of ozone exposure can be alleviated once the processing conditions are optimized. The present review can be used as a baseline for designing different food processing operations involving ozone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Pondicherry University, Puducherry, India."}], "LastName": "Anjali", "ForeName": "K U", "Initials": "KU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management, Sonipat, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Reshma", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India."}], "LastName": "Sruthi", "ForeName": "N U", "Initials": "NU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology, Biochemistry, and Post-harvest Technology Division, ICAR-Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Pandiselvam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agro-Processing & Technology Division, CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST), Trivandrum, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Kothakota", "ForeName": "Anjineyulu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical and Biochemical Processing Division, ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Manoj", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Grain Science & Industry, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA."}], "LastName": "Siliveru", "ForeName": "Kaliramesh", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fruit and Vegetable Product Technology, Prof. Wac\u0142aw D\u0105browski Institute of Agricultural and Food Biotechnology - State Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Marsza\u0142ek", "ForeName": "Krystian", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5769-0004"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fruit and Vegetable Product Technology, Prof. Wac\u0142aw D\u0105browski Institute of Agricultural and Food Biotechnology - State Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Mousavi Khaneghah", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36268992", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2134292"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
