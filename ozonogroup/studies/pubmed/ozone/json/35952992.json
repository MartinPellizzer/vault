Detailed information on anthropogenic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emissions in China is still lacking. This study establishes a comprehensive bottom-up inventory of anthropogenic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emissions in China during 2000-2020. Results show that China's anthropogenic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emissions have increased significantly, from 34.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6\u00a0Gg/yr (gigagrams per year) in 2000 to 128.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.5\u00a0Gg/yr in 2018 with a slight decrease to 124.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.0\u00a0Gg/yr in 2020. The main sources of anthropogenic emissions of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl in China are chemical production (37.1%), solvent use (35.4%), and coal combustion (13.6%) in 2020. China's contribution to global anthropogenic emissions of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl reached almost 50%. Moreover, the ratios of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl CFC-11-eq emissions relative to emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) controlled under the Montreal Protocol in China have increased from 0.8% in 2000 to 11.6% in 2020 and are estimated to continue increasing in the future. In summary, China's anthropogenic CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emissions have shown an increasing trend in the past two decades, made a huge contribution to the total global anthropogenic emissions, and presented a potential increasing impact on the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
