In this context, achieving quality and safe food grains and the identification of suitable processing and disinfection technologies have also become the key issues. Microbial contamination is one of the major reasons responsible for the spoilage of food grains. Various sources of contamination such as air and water (both contaminated with dust and dirt), animals (insects, birds, rodents), environmental conditions (rainfall, drought, temperature), unhygienic handling, harvesting, processing equipment and improper storage conditions are responsible for the microbial spoilage of food grains. In order to maintain the food grains safe and un-contaminated, several food processing technologies have been explored and implemented, with the ultimate purpose of maintaining the safety, freshness and nutritional attributes of the food products. Among these technologies, microwave, radiofrequency, infrared, ohmic heating, novel drying methods along with non-thermal methods such as cold plasma, irradiation, ozonation and nanotechnology have attracted much attention because of considerable reduction in the overall processing time with minimum energy consumption. This review aims to discuss the advances involving the said technologies for controlling the microbial contamination of food grains in accordance with their inactivation. Current research status of the thermal and non-thermal emerging technologies for the preservation of food grains as well as perspectives for further research in this area are also elaborated in detail."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
