The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is the US Environmental Protection Agency's model for determining public policy and forecasting air quality. CMAQ was used to forecast air quality changes due to several emission control strategies that could be implemented between 2008 and 2030 for the South Coast Air Basin that includes Los Angeles. The Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) was used to estimate health and economic impacts of the different emission control strategies based on CMAQ simulations. BenMAP-CE is a computer program based on epidemiologic studies that link human health and air quality. This modeling approach is better for determining optimum public policy than approaches that only examine concentration changes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "Devoun R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Howard University, Washington, DC, USA."}], "LastName": "Saunders", "ForeName": "Emily", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Perea", "ForeName": "Roberto A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Fitzgerald", "ForeName": "Rosa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, USA."}], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "David E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Howard University, Washington, DC, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, USA."}], "LastName": "Stockwell", "ForeName": "William R", "Initials": "WR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Insights", "NlmUniqueID": "101488505", "ISSNLinking": "1178-6302"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Gurjar BR, Butler TM, Lawrence MG, Lelieveld J.
