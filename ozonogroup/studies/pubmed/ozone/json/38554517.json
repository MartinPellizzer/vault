It worsens lung diseases like asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. Despite recent attention from researchers, the link between exhaled breath and ozone-induced injury remains poorly understood. This study aimed to identify novel exhaled biomarkers in ozone-exposed mice using ultra-sensitive photoinduced associative ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and machine learning. Distinct ion peaks for acetonitrile (m/z 42, 60, and 78), butyronitrile (m/z 70, 88, and 106), and hydrogen sulfide (m/z 35) were detected. Integration of tissue characteristics, oxidative stress-related mRNA expression, and exhaled breath condensate free-radical analysis enabled a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between ozone-induced biological responses and potential biomarkers. Under similar exposure levels, C57BL/6 mice exhibited pulmonary injury characterized by significant inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiac damage. Notably, C57BL/6 mice showed free radical signals, indicating a distinct susceptibility profile. Immunodeficient non-obese diabetic Prkdc<sup>-/-</sup>/Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup> (NPI) mice exhibited minimal biological responses to pulmonary injury, with little impact on the heart. These findings suggest a divergence in ozone-induced damage pathways in the two mouse types, leading to alterations in exhaled biomarkers. Integrating biomarker discovery with comprehensive biopathological analysis forms a robust foundation for targeted interventions to manage health risks posed by ozone exposure."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
