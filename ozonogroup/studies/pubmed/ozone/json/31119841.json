However, the short lifetime of the complex has hampered detailed reactivity studies. Reported herein is a remarkable increase in the lifetime (80\u2005s at 10\u2009\u00b0C) of Fe<sup>IV</sup> (TMP<sup>+.</sup> )(O)(Cl) (2; TMP=5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphyrin dianion), produced by the oxidation of Fe<sup>III</sup> (TMP)(Cl) (1) by ozone in \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1-trifluorotoluene (TFT). The lifetime is 720 times longer compared to that of the currently most stable species reported to date. The increase in the lifetime improves the reaction efficiency of 2 toward inert alkane substrates, and allowed observation of the reaction of 2 with a primary C-H bond (BDE<sub>C-H</sub> =ca. 100\u2005kcal\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup> ) directly. Activation parameters for cyclohexane hydroxylation were also obtained."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
