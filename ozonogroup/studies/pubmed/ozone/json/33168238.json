National associations between air pollutant and health outcome were estimated for season (warm, cold vs. year-round), age (base\u00a0\u2265\u00a01, seniors\u00a0>\u00a065), and sex (females\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 and males\u00a0\u2265\u00a01) using Bayesian hierarchical models.", "Overall, the three air pollutants were significantly associated with acute respiratory health outcomes at different lag-days. For respiratory hospitalization, the increased risks in percent changes with 95% posterior intervals for a 10-unit increase in each pollutant were: ozone (lag1, 0.7% (0.4, 0.9)), NO<sub>2</sub> (lag0, 0.7% (0.1, 1.4)), and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag1, 1.3% (0.7, 1.9)). For respiratory mortality: ozone (lag2, 1.2% (0.4, 1.9)), NO<sub>2</sub> (lag1, 2.1% (0.6, 3.5)), and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag1, 0.6% (-1.0, 2.2)). While some differences in risk were observed by season and age group, sex-specific differences were more pronounced. Compared with males, females had a higher respiratory mortality risk (1.8% (0.6, 2.9) vs 0.5% (-0.3, 1.3)) from ozone, a higher respiratory hospitalization risk (0.9% (0.0, 1.8) vs 0.6% (-0.3, 1.4)) but lower mortality risk (1.4% (-1.0, 3.7) vs 2.2% (0.4, 4.0)) from NO<sub>2</sub>, and a lower hospitalization risk (0.7% (-0.2, 1.7) vs 1.8% (1.0, 2.6)) from PM<sub>2.5</sub>.", "This study reports significant health effects of short-term exposure to three ambient air pollutants on respiratory hospitalization (ozone\u2248NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0<\u00a0PM<sub>2.5</sub> per-10 unit; ozone>NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0\u2248\u00a0PM<sub>2.5</sub> per-IQR) and mortality (ozone\u2248NO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in Canada.
