Laws.) needles were performed during summer 1994 in two areas (consisting of six different sites) with different nitrogen (N) deposition levels in the San Bernardino Mountains, southern California. Nitrate reductase activity was used as an integrative indicator of atmospheric nitrogen deposition to pine trees (direct uptake of N species from the atmosphere and N transported from the soil). Deposition of nitrate (NO3-) to pine branches was measured in order to determine dry atmospheric inputs of the oxidized N species to tree foliage. High NR activity was detected in all of the experimental sites. Activity of the enzyme was significantly higher at the locations characterized by higher NO3- deposition to branches--slight positive correlation between branch deposited NO3- and NR activity was found. However, high variability of NR in time and between the experimental sites discredit the NR assay as a reliable indicator of N deposition for ponderosa pine in the field conditions. This could be caused by substantial interference from other abiotic and biotic factors with tropospheric ozone as probably the most important one."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "W.
