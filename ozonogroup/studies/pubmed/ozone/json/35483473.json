Natural soils are believed to be important and widespread sinks of atmospheric CCl<sub>4</sub>, although poorly characterized due to a limited number of measurements. In this study, for the first time in situ static-chamber measurements and laboratory-based incubations for CCl<sub>4</sub> fluxes were conducted at coastal Antarctic tundra. Results showed that soil in remote Antarctica is also acting as a CCl<sub>4</sub> sink, with an average uptake rate of -2.2 \u00b1 0.6 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, which is comparable to the reported soil sinks in other regions of the world. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was found across different types of tundra, such normal upland tundra, coastal marsh tundra, and tundra in the sea animal colonies. Soil CCl<sub>4</sub> fluxes did not show significant correlations (p > 0.05) with soil moisture, pH, TOC, TN, TP and Cl contents. Laboratory-based anoxic incubations showed that the uptake rates of CCl<sub>4</sub> in tundra soil were suppressed; post-thermal sterilization incubations showed that soil CCl<sub>4</sub> sink was enhanced; these results suggested that CCl<sub>4</sub> degradation in tundra soil was likely an abiotic process preferring oxic environments. A rough extrapolation suggested that Antarctic tundra may degrade about 2.4 metric tons of atmospheric CCl<sub>4</sub> each year. Combining soil CCl<sub>4</sub> fluxes from this study and other literature reports, CCl<sub>4</sub> partial lifetime with respect to the soil sink was evaluated to be 354 (235-474) years, which supported the recent viewpoint that the soil sink of CCl<sub>4</sub> is smaller than previously thought."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
