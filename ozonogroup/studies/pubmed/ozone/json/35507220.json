Relevant information is supplied on the temporal and spatial variability of TCO along the ITD zone, which is an important factor influencing the earth's atmosphere. Several studies over the years have established the relationship and have influence several atmospheric processes on TCO. However, the relationship between intertropical discontinuity and TCO over West Africa has a gap. This study tends to examine the influence ITD has on TCO variation using the West African region as a case study. The study used wind, ozone, and dewpoint temperature data for the period between 1980 and 2019. To assess the variability and trend over the study region, several statistical methods were used, including Pearson correlation, Mann-Kendall, and linear regression model. The Mann-Kendall test shows an increasing trend throughout the months over the study region. Spatial analysis also revealed that regions north of the ITD have a higher concentration of TCO than the southern region of the ITD between April and September. However, ITD influence was more visible during the wet months of June to August (JJA) as the highest concentration of TCO was observed during this period across all latitude, but more deviation was observed between latitude 10 to 18\u00b0 N, while the least occurrence is observed when ITD is at its minimum position in the month of December to February (DJF). The ACRV shows that 14\u00b0 N exhibit the highest variation with a value of 4.84, while the deviation is also at its highest with value of 13.65. The monthly position of ITD for 40\u00a0years was also analysed to observe the monthly deviation along the ITD region 40\u00a0years, and the spatial distribution of TCO was analysed from January to December. It is of note that during the cause of this study, low-ozone values of 220DU are not found in the study region. The highest and the lowest value of TCO is 295 DU and 227 DU, respectively, with an average range of 68DU."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
