Pinto) were grown in the greenhouse at a light intensity of 400\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> . When the primary leaf was fully expanded, plants were divided into four groups and subjected to one of the following treatments: light intensity of 400\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and filtered air (control); light intensity of 400\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) (150\u00a0nl\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> for 5\u00a0h) (ozonated); light intensity of 1000\u00a0\u00b5mol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> for 5\u00a0h and filtered air (HL); and light intensity of 1000\u00a0\u00b5mol m<sup>-2</sup> \u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> and O<sub>3</sub> (150\u00a0nl\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> ) for 5\u00a0h (HL\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> ). \u2022 \u2002 At the end of the treatments (HL and/or O<sub>3</sub> ) a strong decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate as well a decrease in stomatal conductance were observed, while no changes in intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were recorded. In addition the F<sub>v</sub> \u00a0:\u00a0F<sub>m</sub> ratio (maximal quantum yield for PSII photochemistry) decreased in the stressed leaves (HL and/or O<sub>3</sub> ), indicating photoinhibition, and they showed a corresponding increase in minimal fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub> ), indicating a higher number of deactivating photosystem II (PSII) centres. \u2022 \u2002 The maximum catalytic activity of the Benson-Calvin cycle enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase (FBPase) and Rubisco, decreased following HL\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> stress but activation was enhanced. A linear relation was found between activation state of NADP-malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and the flux of electrons through PSII and in HL\u00a0+\u00a0O<sub>3</sub> -treated plants NADP-MDH activity decreased at high irradiance levels, indicating a limitation in linear electron flux."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica e Biotecnologie Agrarie, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Via del Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guidi", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica e Biotecnologie Agrarie, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Via del Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Degl'Innocenti", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Chimica e Biotecnologie Agrarie, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Via del Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soldatini", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Back J, Vanderklein DW, Topa MA. 1999.
