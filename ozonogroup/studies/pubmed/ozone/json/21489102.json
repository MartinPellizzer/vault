The present study was conducted to evaluate the interactive effects of supplemental UV-B (sUV-B) and mineral nutrients on a tuber crop, potato (Solanum tuberosum L. var Kufri Badshah), under natural field conditions in a dry tropical environment. The nutrient treatments were the recommended dose of NPK (F(o)), 1.5 times the recommended dose of NPK (F(1)), 1.5 times the recommended dose of N (F(2)) and 1.5 times the recommended dose of K (F(3)). The response of potato plants to sUV-B varied with nutrient treatment and concentration. sUV-B adversely affected growth, yield and quality of tubers, causing an increase in reducing sugars in the tubers and thus reducing the economic value. Growth and fresh weight of tubers was maximal with sUV-B at 1.5 times recommended NPK, but the dry weight of tubers were highest with the recommended NPK dose. Reducing sugar content was lower in potato plants treated with sUV-B and the recommended NPK than with sUV-B and 1.5 times the recommended NPK. This study thus clearly shows that growing potato with 1.5 times the recommended NPK or 1.5 times the recommended dose of N/K does not alleviate the sUV-B induced changes in yield and quality of tubers compared to the recommended NPK dose."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21489102", "10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00395.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
