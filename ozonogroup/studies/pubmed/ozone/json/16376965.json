RFAs oxidation (i.e., degradation) efficiency increased with increasing the amount of used ozone and temperature. The degradation process with respect to the acid was found to follow first-order kinetics. The ozonation of RFAs was modeled as an overall second-order reaction for both reactants. The apparent overall second-order rate constants were calculated based on the pseudo first-order rate constants obtained from the kinetic data fitting for the acid degradation. The apparent overall second-order rate constant was affected by pH and temperature. At 20 degrees C and when pH increased from 8 to 11, the apparent overall second-order rate constant increased almost by a factor of 5 (from 3.9 x10(3) to 1.8 x10(4)M(-1)s(-1)) for 9 mgL(-1) resin acid and a factor of 4 (from 9.6 x10(3) to 3.9 x10(4)M(-1)s(-1)) for 8 mgL(-1) fatty acid. At pH 8 and as temperature increased from 10 to 20 degrees C, the apparent overall second-order rate constant increased almost by a factor of 5 (from 8.2 x10(2) to 3.9 x10(3)M(-1)s(-1)) for 9 mgL(-1) resin acid and a factor of 3 (from 3.5 x10(3) to 9.6 x10(3)M(-1)s(-1)) for 8 mgL(-1) fatty acid. Microtox bioassay tests were completed to evaluate the toxicity of RFAs samples before and after ozonation. For the resin acid, there was an increase in toxicity as a result of ozonation. Meanwhile, toxicity of fatty acid samples decreased as a result of ozonation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta., Canada T6G 2W2. mgamalel-din@ualberta.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gamal El-Din", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Daniel W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al Momani", "ForeName": "Fares", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Weixing", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paper"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16376965", "10.1016/j.watres.2005.11.003", "S0043-1354(05)00630-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
