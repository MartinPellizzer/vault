Compared to conventional conductance-based inorganic sensors, our novel sensory film has many advantages such as easy fabrication, low-cost, and portability. NMR data confirmed that phosphorescence drop is attributed to oxidation of the core triplet generating aldehyde group of the phosphor. We observed that linear correlation between phosphorescence and ozone concentration and it can detect ozone concentrations of 0.1 ppm that is the threshold concentration harmful to human tissue and respiratory organs. Like a litmus paper, this ozone sensor can be fabricated as a free-standing and disposable film."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Macromolecular Science and Engineering, \u2021Department of Materials Science and Engineering, \u00a7Department of Chemical Engineering, and \u2225Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, United States."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dongwook", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Jaehun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bilby", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Min Sang", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Jaesook", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jinsang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25616157", "10.1021/am5087165"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
