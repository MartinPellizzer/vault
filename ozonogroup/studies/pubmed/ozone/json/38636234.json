Warm-season (April-September) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were estimated using satellite-based machine-learning models with national coverage. Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying exposures was employed to evaluate the association of long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure with incident CVD (overall CVD, hypertension, stroke, and coronary heart disease [CHD]). Assuming causality, a counterfactual framework was employed to estimate O<sub>3</sub>-attributable CVD burden based on the exposure-response (E-R) relationship obtained from this study. Decomposition analysis was utilized to quantify the contributions of four key direct driving factors (O<sub>3</sub> exposure, population size, age structure, and incidence rate) to the net change of O<sub>3</sub>-related CVD cases between 2010 and 2018.", "A total of 4428 CVD, 2600 hypertension, 1174 stroke, and 337 CHD events were reported during 9-year follow-up. Each 10-\u03bcg/m\u00b3\u00a0increase in warm-season O<sub>3</sub> was associated with an incident risk of 1.078 (95% confidence interval [CI]:\u00a01.050-1.106) for overall CVD, 1.098 (95% CI:\u00a01.062-1.135) for hypertension, 1.073 (95% CI:\u00a01.019-1.131) for stroke, and 1.150 (95% CI: 1.038-1.274) for CHD, respectively. We observed no departure from linear E-R relationships of O<sub>3</sub> exposure with overall CVD (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.22), hypertension (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.19), stroke (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.70), and CHD (P<sub>nonlinear</sub>= 0.44) at a broad concentration range of 60-160\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>. Compared with rural dwellers, those residing in urban areas were at significantly greater O<sub>3</sub>-associated incident risks of overall CVD, hypertension, and stroke. We estimated 1.22 million (10.6% of overall CVD in 2018) incident CVD cases could be attributable to ambient O<sub>3</sub> pollution in 2018, representing an overall 40.9% growth (0.36 million) compared to 2010 (0.87 million, 9.7% of overall CVD in 2010). This remarkable rise in O<sub>3</sub>-attributable CVD cases was primary driven by population aging (+24.0%), followed by increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentration (+10.5%) and population size (+6.7%).", "Long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was associated with an elevated risk and burden of incident CVD in Chinese adults, especially among urban dwellers.
