Associations between long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure (averaged values from 2002 to 2010) and multiple causes of death were evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for individual- and census tract-level covariates, and potentially confounding copollutants and temperature.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Long-term annual average exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was significantly associated with deaths caused by cardiovascular disease (per 10 ppb; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.06), ischemic heart disease (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09), respiratory disease (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15) in single-pollutant models. The results were robust to alternative models and adjustment for copollutants (fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide), although some evidence of confounding by temperature was observed. Significantly elevated respiratory disease mortality risk associated with long-term O<sub>3</sub> exposure was found among those living in locations with high temperature (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>\u2009<\u20090.05).<b>Conclusions:</b> This study found that long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> is associated with increased risk for multiple causes of mortality, suggesting that establishment of annual and/or seasonal federal O<sub>3</sub> standards is needed to more adequately protect public health from ambient O<sub>3</sub> exposures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine and."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Chris C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "Richard B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Jiyoung", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Medicine and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Yongzhao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silverman", "ForeName": "Debra T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Rena R", "Initials": "RR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "California Air Resources Board, Sacramento, California;
