Microfluidics is a powerful tool to study the complexities of interfacial phenomena involved in multiphase flow in well-controlled geometries. Recently, the thiolene-based polymer called NOA81 emerged as an ideal material in the fabrication of microfluidic devices, since it combines the versatility of conventional soft photolithography with a wide range of achievable wettability conditions. Specifically, the wettability of NOA81 can be continuously tuned through exposure to UV-ozone. Despite its growing popularity, the exact physical and chemical mechanisms behind the wettability alteration have not been fully characterized. Here, we apply different characterization techniques, including contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the impact of UV-ozone on the chemical and physical properties of NOA81 surfaces. We find that UV-ozone exposure increases the oxygen-containing polar functional groups, which enhances the surface energy and hydrophilicity of NOA81. Additionally, our AFM measurements show that spin-coated NOA81 surfaces have a roughness less than a nanometer, which is further reduced after UV-ozone exposure. Lastly, we extend NOA81 use cases by creating (i) 2D surface with controlled wettability gradient and (ii) a 3D column packed with monodisperse NOA81 beads of controlled size and wettability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L8, Canada."}], "LastName": "Masouminia", "ForeName": "Mahtab", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L8, Canada."}], "LastName": "Dalnoki-Veress", "ForeName": "Kari", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L8, Canada."}], "LastName": "de Lannoy", "ForeName": "Charles-Fran\u00e7ois", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1136-9957"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4L8, Canada."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Benzhong", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36763353", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c02719"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
