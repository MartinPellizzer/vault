Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) episode and non-episode days were identified according to China Ambient Air Quality Standard, and the concentrations of total quantified VOCs (TVOCs) were 33.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.64\u00a0ppbv and 29.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.31\u00a0ppbv, respectively. During different O<sub>3</sub> pollution episodes, alkanes comprised the highest proportion to TVOC concentrations, while alkenes contributed the most to ozone formation potential (OFP). In addition, O<sub>3</sub> episode days were mainly caused by enhanced emissions of precursors and meteorological conditions favorable to O<sub>3</sub> production. Based on Empirical Kinetic Modelling Approach (EKMA), the O<sub>3</sub> formation in Weinan was found in the transitional regime, in which the synergistic reduction of VOCs and nitrogen oxide (NOx) would be more effective for O<sub>3</sub> reduction. Eight sources were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, with natural gas (NG)/liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) usage as the most significant contributor to VOC concentration, followed by vehicle exhaust, biomass burning, solvent usage, fuel evaporation, rubber/plastic industrial emissions, biogenic source, and mixed industrial emissions. Furthermore, rubber/plastic industrial emissions, solvent usage, fuel evaporation, and vehicle exhaust were the most significant sources to O<sub>3</sub> formation. Based on conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF), vehicle exhaust, fuel evaporation, and solvent usage were mainly local emissions, while other sources were mainly affected by regional transport. This study provides useful reference for research on the atmospheric photochemical formation of O<sub>3</sub> and evidence for regional O<sub>3</sub> reduction strategies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
