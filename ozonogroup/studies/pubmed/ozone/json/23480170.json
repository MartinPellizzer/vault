In this work, we have used neutron reflection and surface pressure measurements to study the reaction of the ubiquitous pollutant gas-phase ozone, O3, with pure and mixed phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interface. The results reveal that the reaction of the unsaturated lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC, with ozone leads to the rapid loss of the terminal C9 portion of the oleoyl strand of POPC from the air-water interface. The loss of the C9 portion from the interface is accompanied by an increase in the surface pressure (decrease in surface tension) of the film at the air-water interface. The results suggest that the portion of the oxidized oleoyl strand that is still attached to the lipid headgroup rapidly reverses its orientation and penetrates the air-water interface alongside the original headgroup, thus increasing the surface pressure. The reaction of POPC with ozone also leads to a loss of material from the palmitoyl strand, but the loss of palmitoyl material occurs after the loss of the terminal C9 portion from the oleoyl strand of the molecule, suggesting that the palmitoyl material is lost in a secondary reaction step. Further experiments studying the reaction of mixed monolayers composed of unsaturated lipid POPC and saturated lipid dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DPPC, revealed that no loss of DPPC from the air-water interface occurs, eliminating the possibility that a reactive species such as an OH radical is formed and is able to attack nearby lipid chains. The reaction of ozone with the mixed films does cause a significant change in the surface pressure of the air-water interface. Thus, the reaction of unsaturated lipids in lung surfactant changes and impairs the physical properties of the film at the air-water interface."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HX, UK."}], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "Katherine C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jones", "ForeName": "Stephanie H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rennie", "ForeName": "Adrian R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "King", "ForeName": "Martin D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "Andrew D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "Brian R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lucas", "ForeName": "Claire O M", "Initials": "CO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Campbell", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "Arwel V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2644-64-6", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE895536Y5", "NameOfSubstance": "1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutron Diffraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23480170", "10.1021/la304312y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
