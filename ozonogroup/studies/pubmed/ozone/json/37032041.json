The easterly high-pressure (SWW) circulation occurred most frequently (30%; 276 day), followed by northwesterly high-pressure (AN) circulation (24.3%; 224 day). The SWW type had the highest O<sub>3</sub> anomaly of +17.28\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>, which was caused by excellent photochemical reactions, poor diffusion ability and regional transport. Due to the higher humidity and precipitation in the low-pressure type (C), the O<sub>3</sub> increase (+8.02\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) was less than that in the SWW type. Good diffusion/wet deposition and weak formation ability contributed to O<sub>3</sub> decrease in AN (-12.54\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>) and northerly high-pressure (ESN) CTs (-12.26\u00a0\u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>). The intra-area transport of O<sub>3</sub> was significant in polluted circulations (SWW- and C-CTs). In addition, higher temperature, radiation and less rainfall also contributed to higher O<sub>3</sub> in northern Beijing under the SWW type. For the clean CTs (AN and ESN CTs), precursor amount and intra-area transport played a dominant role in O<sub>3</sub> distribution. Under the northeasterly low-pressure CT, better formation conditions and higher precursor amount combined with the intra-area southerly transport to cause higher O<sub>3</sub> values in the south than in the north. The higher O<sub>3</sub> in the northwestern area under the northeasterly high-pressure type was influenced by weaker titration loss and high O<sub>3</sub> concentration in previous day. Annual variation in the CTs contributed up to 86.1% of the annual variation in O<sub>3</sub>. About 78%-83% of the diurnal variation in O<sub>3</sub> resulted from local meteorological factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
