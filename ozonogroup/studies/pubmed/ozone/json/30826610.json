O<sub>3</sub> is an oxidative pollutant that causes leaf symptoms in sensitive plants. This study aims to adjust a multilinear model for the monitoring of O<sub>3</sub> in subtropical climatic conditions by associating O<sub>3</sub> concentrations with measurements of morphological leaf traits in tobacco plants and different environmental variables. The plants were distributed into five areas (residential, urban or industrial) in the southern region of Brazil and exposed during 14 periods, of 14 days each, during the years of 2014 and 2015. The environmental variables and leaf traits during the exposure periods were described by mean, median, standard deviation and minimum and maximum values. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were applied on data from exposure periods. Leaf injury index, leaf area, leaf dry mass, temperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation and accumulated rainfall were used in the regression analyses to select the best models for predicting O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Leaf injury characteristically caused by O<sub>3</sub> was verified in all areas and periods of plant exposure. Higher values of leaf injury (24.5% and 27.7%) were registered in the 13th and 12th exposure periods during spring and in areas influenced by urban and industrial clutches. The VPD, temperature, global solar radiation and O<sub>3</sub> were correlated to leaf injury. Environmental variables [leaf area, leaf dry mass, global solar radiation and accumulated rainfall] and primarily the VPD were fundamental to improve the adjustments done in the bioindicator model (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f\u2265\u202f0.73). Our research shows that biomonitoring employing the tobacco \"Bel-W3\" can be improved by measuring morphological leaf traits and meteorological parameters. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub> fumigation experiment should be performed with biomonitoring as conducted in this study, which are useful in understanding the role of other environmental factors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
