This research examines high school students' ideas about greenhouse effect and the results may be useful for the respective authorities to improve cultural and educational aspects of next generation. In this cross-sectional study, a 42 question questionnaire with mix of open and closed questions was used to evaluate high school students' view about the mechanism, consequences, causes and cures of global warming. To assess students' knowledge, cognitive score was also calculated. 1035 students were randomly selected from 19 educational districts of Tehran. Sampling method was multi stage. Only 5.1% of the students could explain greenhouse effect correctly and completely. 88.8% and 71.2% respectively believed \"if the greenhouse effect gets bigger the Earth will get hotter\" and \"incidence of more skin cancers is a consequence of global warming\". 69.6% and 68.8% respectively thought \"the greenhouse effect is made worse by too much carbon dioxide\" and \"presence of ozone holes is a cause of greenhouse effect\". 68.4% believed \"not using cars so much is a cure for global warming\". While a student's 'cognitive score' could range from -36 to +36, Students' mean cognitive score was equal to +1.64. Mean cognitive score of male students and grade 2 &amp; 3 students was respectively higher than female ones (P&lt;0.01) and grade 1 students (P&lt;0.001) but there was no statistically significant difference between students of different regions (P&gt;0.05). In general, students' knowledge about global warming was not acceptable and there were some misconceptions in the students' mind, such as supposing ozone holes as a cause and more skin cancer as a consequence of global warming. The Findings of this survey indicate that, this important stratum of society have been received no sufficient and efficient education and sensitization on this matter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Air Pollution Health and Occupational Diseases Research Unit, Chronic Respiratory Diseases Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yazdanparast", "ForeName": "Taraneh", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salehpour", "ForeName": "Sousan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masjedi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seyedmehdi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boyes", "ForeName": "Eddie", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stanisstreet", "ForeName": "Martin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Attarchi", "ForeName": "Mirsaeed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Acta Med Iran", "NlmUniqueID": "14540050R", "ISSNLinking": "0044-6025"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cognition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Global Warming"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Students"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23605603"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
