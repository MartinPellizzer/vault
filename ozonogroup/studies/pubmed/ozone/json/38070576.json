The occurrence of regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution are influenced by local emissions and cross-regional transportation. In this study, we identified the predominant synoptic patterns that were associated with regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution from August to November in 2015-2021 using the Lamb-Jenkinson classification technique. All synoptic types were divided into four major categories of NE-type, C-type, S-type and A-type, which accounted for 42\u00a0%, 25\u00a0%, 18\u00a0% and 15\u00a0% of the total number of regional O3 pollution days, respectively. The weather conditions for each synoptic pattern were described by using MERRA-2 datasets. Then a rapidly method was established to quantify the contribution of cross-regional processes to high O<sub>3</sub> concentration in different synoptic patterns over the PRD through the WRF-Flexpart model. The NE-type weather condition was characterized by a relatively large wind speed with a significant cross-regional transport contribution of 35.8\u00a0%. The A-type weather condition had moderate surface wind speed with the stable weather condition, resulting in a lower cross-region transport contribution of 27.7\u00a0%. Under controlled by C-type, the stagnant weather condition caused by low-pressure systems on its periphery, would suppress diffusion of O<sub>3</sub>. As a result, the regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the PRD were mostly attributed to locally (87.9\u00a0%) with minimal cross-regional transport (12.1\u00a0%). The S-type weather condition was mainly associated with the West Pacific Subtropical High and the surface equalization pressure field, accompanied by low wind speed. Therefore, the considerable (minor) contribution of local production (cross-regional transport) of 83.3\u00a0% (16.7\u00a0%) to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the PRD is a consequence of the stagnation weather condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
