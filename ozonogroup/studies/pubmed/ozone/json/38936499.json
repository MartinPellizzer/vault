This review synthesizes the existing data to assess the transformation, bioavailability, and potential hazards of two tire-derived pollutants 6PPD and 6PPD-Q. The comparative analysis of different thermal methods utilized in repurposing waste materials like tires and plastics into valuable products are analyzed. These methods shed light on the aspects of pyrolysis and catalytic conversion processes, providing valuable perspectives into optimizing the waste valorization and mitigating environmental impacts. Furthermore, we have examined the bioavailability and potential hazards of chemicals used in tire manufacturing, based on the literature included in this review. The bioavailability of these chemicals, particularly the transformation of 6PPD to 6PPD-Q, poses significant ecological risks. 6PPD-Q is highly bioavailable in aquatic environments, indicating its potential for widespread ecological harm. The persistence and mobility of 6PPD-Q in the environment, along with its toxicological effects, highlight the critical need for ongoing monitoring and the development of effective mitigation strategies to reduce its impact on both human health and ecosystem. Future research should focus on understanding the chronic effects of low-level exposure to these compounds on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as the potential for bioaccumulation in the food chain. Additionally, this review outlines the knowledge gaps, recommending further research into the toxicity of tire-derived pollutants in organisms and the health implications for humans and ecosystems."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
