The present study compared these ozone-induced inflammatory responses in different strains of male rat, Brown Norway rats from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (BN-CRL), and Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (BN-HSD), and Fischer 344 (F344), Sprague-Dawley (SPD), and Wistar (WSTR) male rats from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. Ozone-induced permeability damage was indicated by recoveries of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) albumin 20 h following single exposures of 6 h to either air or 1 ppm or 2 ppm O3. Although BALF albumin recoveries from air-exposed rats were not significantly different between strains, ozone exposures resulted in a range of enhancements of BALF albumin of 2-, 9-, 17-, 7-, and 20-fold following exposures of BN-CRL, BN-HSD, F344, SPD, and WSTR rats to 2 ppm ozone, respectively. Concomitant strain differences in the number of ozone-induced BAL-recoverable neutrophils were not observed, except for BN-CRL rats, which demonstrated significantly lower numbers. However, the degree of ozone-induced permeability damage did directly correspond to differences observed in the numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils in the peripheral blood and collagenase tissue digest of lavaged and perfused lungs prior to ozone exposure. Ozone-resistant BN-CRL rats exhibited the highest numbers of blood and lung tissue neutrophils and eosinophils when compared with ozone-susceptible WSTR rats exhibiting the lowest number of these granulocytes. These data suggested that the presence of high numbers of blood and tissue granulocytes at the onset of short-term ozone exposures might provide a certain degree of protection against subsequent pathological events."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassett", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elbon-Copp", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barraclough-Mitchell", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES05255", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 HL34674", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred BN"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10983520", "10.1080/00984100050082076"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
