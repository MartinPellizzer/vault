Ozone sensitivity in rice cultivars is often evaluated based on visible leaf injury at an early growth stage. However, it is not clear whether reduction in grain yield is related to visible injury. Therefore, visible damage and grain yield reduction were examined in Japanese and Asian rice cultivars exposed to ozone. In experiment 1, 3-week-old rice seedlings were exposed to ozone (min.: 20 nl.l(-1), max.:120 nl.l(-1)) for 12 h in open-top chambers (OTCs). Visible leaf injury was quantified according to a leaf bronzing score. In experiment 2, rice plants were exposed to ozone in OTCs throughout the cropping season until grain harvest. Daily mean ozone concentrations were maintained at 2, 23, 28, 42, and 57 nl.l(-1) with a regular diurnal pattern of exposure. After harvest, grain yield was determined. Based on visible injury to the uppermost fully expanded leaf, the indica cultivar 'Kasalath' was most tolerant, and the japonica cultivar 'Kirara 397' was most sensitive to ozone. However, grain yields for both 'Kasalath' and 'Kirara 397' were significantly decreased after ozone exposure. The indica cultivar 'Jothi' suffered severe injury after ozone exposure but had no reduction in grain yield. Therefore, ozone sensitivity of rice cultivars evaluated by visible injury did not coincide with that evaluated by the reductions in grain yield. These results suggest that mechanisms that induce acute leaf injury do not relate to chronic ozone toxicity that reduces yield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Science Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Japan. hiroko-s@criepi.denken.or.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sawada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kohno", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19778370", "10.1111/j.1438-8677.2009.00233.x", "PLB233"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
