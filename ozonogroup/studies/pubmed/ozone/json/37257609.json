Hence, this study aimed to use the ozonation and pelleting processes to enhance the digestibility and reduce the ruminal methane emissions of wheat straw enriched with two nitrogen sources (i.e., urea and heat-processed broiler litter). Various analyses were conducted on the pellets, including digestibility indicators, mechanical properties, surface chemistry functionalization, chemical-spectral-structural features, and energy requirements. For comparison, loose forms of the samples were also analyzed. The nitrogen-enriched ozonated wheat straw pellets had 43.06\u00a0% lower lignin, 28.30\u00a0% higher gas production for 24\u00a0h, 12.28\u00a0% higher metabolizable energy, 13.78\u00a0% higher in vitro organic matter digestibility for 24\u00a0h, and 28.81\u00a0% higher short-chain fatty acid content than the nitrogen-enriched loose sample. The reduction of methane emissions by rumen microorganisms of nitrogen-enriched wheat straw by ozonation, pelleting, and ozonation-pelleting totaled 89.15\u00a0%, 23.35\u00a0%, and 66.98\u00a0%, respectively. The ozonation process resulted in a 64\u00a0% increase in the particle density, a 5.5-time increase in the tensile strength, and a 75\u00a0% increase in the crushing energy of nitrogen-enriched wheat straw. In addition, ozone treatment could also reduce the specific and thermal energy consumption required in the pelleting process by 15.10\u00a0% and 7.61\u00a0%, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
