This sampling was performed to increase understanding of the distributions of their compositions, illustrate the overall characteristics of different classes of VOCs, assess the ages of air masses, and apportion sources of VOCs using principal compound analysis/absolute principal component scores (PCA/APCS). During the sampling periods, the relative abundance of the four classes of VOCs as determined by the concentration-based method was different from that determined by the reactivity approach. Alkanes were found to be most abundant (44.3-50.1%) by the concentration-based method, but aromatic compounds were most abundant (38.2-44.5%) by the reactivity approach. Aromatics and alkenes contributed most (73-84%) to the ozone formation potential. Toluene was the most abundant compound (11.8-12.7%) during every sampling period. When the maximum incremental reactivity approach was used, propene, toluene, m,p-xylene, 1-butene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were the five most abundant compounds during two sampling periods. X/B, T/B, and E/B ratios in this study were lower than those found in other cities, possibly due to the aging of the air mass at this site. Four components were extracted from application of PCA to the data. It was found that the contribution of vehicle exhaust to total VOCs accounted for 53% of VOCs, while emissions due to the solvent use contributed 33% of the total VOCs. Industrial sources contributed 3% and biogenic sources contributed 11%. The results showed that vehicle exhausts (i.e., unburned vehicle emissions\u00a0+ vehicle internal engine combustion) were dominant in VOC emissions during the experimental period. The solvent use made the second most significant contribution to ambient VOCs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education, School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China. anjunlin@yahoo.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jun-lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-si", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fang-kun", "Initials": "FK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2003 Jan;50(4):545-56", "ArticleIdList": ["12685754"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2004 Jun;129(3):489-98", "ArticleIdList": ["15016469"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2004 Aug 15;329(1-3):3-16", "ArticleIdList": ["15262154"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2004 Nov;57(8):931-42", "ArticleIdList": ["15488583"]}, {"Citation": "Sci Total Environ. 2009 Jul 1;407(14):4312-9", "ArticleIdList": ["19423150"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2008 Apr 1;152(2):669-76", "ArticleIdList": ["17854990"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2009 Jul 15;166(1):17-26", "ArticleIdList": ["19136203"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Rev. 2003 Dec;103(12):4605-38", "ArticleIdList": ["14664626"]}, {"Citation": "Chemosphere. 2004 Apr;55(4):585-94", "ArticleIdList": ["15006511"]}, {"Citation": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng. 2005;40(10):1843-60", "ArticleIdList": ["16194907"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1987 Nov 13;238(4829):945-50", "ArticleIdList": ["17829360"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21552987", "10.1007/s10661-011-2086-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
