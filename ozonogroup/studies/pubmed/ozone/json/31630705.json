Particular attention was paid to congenital syndrome, such as Vacterl, Fabry and Goldenhar syndrome and acquired conditions such as Schoenlein-Henoch disease potentially leading to renal impairment. In addition, oxidative stress in newborns is involved in the progression of renal failure. When associated to congenital renal anomalies a dialysis treatment might be needed. Dialysis is a treatment option for children who are experiencing kidney failure. We treated about the differences between adult and pediatric dialysis concerning physical and staffing requirements. In this regards we reported a clinical case of a child in dialytic treatment who was used innovative topical ozone therapy for infantile atopic dermatitis. In conclusion, aim of this report was to discuss about pediatric nephro-urological issues by reporting literature reviews and clinical cases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "CollectiveName": "special issue: \u201cFocus on pediatric nephrology\u201d"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chief UOSD Pediatric Nephrology, AOUP Policlinico G.
