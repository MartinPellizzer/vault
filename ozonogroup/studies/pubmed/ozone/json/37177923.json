The results showed that, during the typhoon process from October 11 to 13, the O<sub>3</sub>-8h (maximum of 8 hours sliding average) concentration exceeded the standard. The averaged <i>\u03c1</i>(O<sub>3</sub>-8h) of Hainan Island reached its peak value (130.5 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>) in October 12, 2020, with the O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration exceeding the standard in four cities and counties, in which Lingao County reached the highest concentration of 198.44 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>. During the typhoon process, the hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentration was negatively correlated with precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed and positively correlated with air pressure and air temperature. Moreover, the correlation coefficients between O<sub>3</sub> with precipitation, air pressure, and relative humidity exceeded the 99.9% confidence level. The southeastern coastal provinces of China were the main contribution source area for this ozone pollution process on Hainan Island. Affected by the downdraft inside the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the downdraft outside the circumference of typhoon Nangka, vertical transport in the atmosphere appeared over the contribution source area. The meteorological conditions were favorable for atmospheric photochemical reactions. Air pollutants were transported to Hainan Island along the northeast airflow around the typhoon, resulting in the occurrence of an O<sub>3</sub> pollution event. In addition, this study built a weather conceptual model of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Hainan Island affected by typhoon Nangka, which can be used as a reference for the joint pollution prevention and control by air pollution prediction, early warning, and environmental management departments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chuan-Bo", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China Sea Meteorological Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Hainan Province, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Jin-He", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-Shuai", "Initials": "WS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37177923", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202206123"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
