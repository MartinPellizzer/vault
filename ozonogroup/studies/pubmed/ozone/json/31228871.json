The aim of this study was to compare the pre- and post-treatment pain scores of patients undergoing paravertebral ozone/oxygen (O<sub>3</sub> /O<sub>2</sub> ) injections for low back pain.", "From September 2018 to December 2018, 122 patients who underwent paravertebral ozone injections due to low back pain were examined retrospectively; 62 patients who met the study criteria were included. The patients were injected with 15\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (50 mL) O<sub>3</sub> /O<sub>2</sub> gas in the paravertebral space. The subjects were treated every 7\u00a0days for 6 total session. The VAS and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were assessed before treatment and after treatment (first and third months). The patients' body mass indexes (BMIs) were measured before the injections.", "There were 12 male patients and 50 female patients. The mean age was 51.9 (range 25 to 71) years. The mean duration of pain was 9.1\u00a0(3 to 24) months. Significant improvements were observed in the statistical comparison of VAS and ODI scores between the pre-injection and first month controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.000). There was no significant difference in the statistical comparison of VAS and ODI scores between the first and third months (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).
