Chickpea plants were grown in non-saline and saline conditions, with and without a repeated exposure to ozone. Salinity at a concentration of 30 mM NaCl caused a substantial reduction in plant height, number of leaves and the dry weights of the leaves, stems and roots. Biomass allocation to the leaves increased, predominantly at the expense of the roots. Ozone at a concentration of 85 nmol mol(-1) for 6 h per day for 25 days reduced plant height and dry weights but had no effect on leaf number. The results show substantial effects of salinity and ozone on chickpea growth and ion concentrations. When ozonated plants are grown in the presence of salinity, further reductions in growth occur."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Stress Unit, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Sussex, Brighton, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welfare", "ForeName": "Karen", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeo", "ForeName": "Anthony R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Flowers", "ForeName": "Timothy J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cicer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12395854", "10.1016/s0269-7491(02)00109-4", "S0269749102001094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
