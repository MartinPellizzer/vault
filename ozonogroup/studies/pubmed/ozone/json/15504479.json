The conversion of dye increased with the increasing of pH and oxygen flow rate. As the reaction rate constant and the volumetric mass transfer coefficient increase while the ozone equilibrium concentration decreases with the temperature, there is a minimum conversion of dye at 25 degrees C. The increasing of initial dye concentration leads to a decreasing conversion of dye while the ozonation rate increases. The formation of intermediates and the variation of pH, TOC, and nitrate ion during ozonation were investigated by the use of some analytical instruments such as GC/MS, GC, and IC. The intermediates of weak organic acids lower the pH value of the solution. The probable degradation mechanism of the Cationic Red X-GRL in aqueous solution was deliberated with the aid of Molecular Orbital calculations. The N(12)-C(13) site in Cationic Red X-GRL, instead of the N(6)-N(7) site, is found to be the principal site for ozone cycloaddition in the degradation processes. During the degradation process, among the six nitrogen atoms of Cationic Red X-GRL, one is transferred into a nitrate ion, one is converted into an amine compound, and the remaining four are transformed into two molecules of nitrogen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, PR China. weirong@mail.hz.zj.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Weirong", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Huixiang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dahui", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coloring Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Azo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coloring Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15504479", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.08.014", "S0045-6535(04)00691-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
