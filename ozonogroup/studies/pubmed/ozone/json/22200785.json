Our hospital employed Bio-Kil to treat air-conditioning filters and nursing staff uniforms. We also assessed the efficacy of different detergents. Using Bio-Kil technology, the mean bacterial count in the air was reduced from 108.8 CFU/h/plate (n=420) to 68.6 CFU/h/plate (n=630). On the lower hems of the Bio-Kil-treated gowns, the mean bacterial count was 1,201 CFU/100 cm(2), markedly lower than the bacterial count of 7,753 CFU/100 cm(2), found on the parts of the gowns not treated with Bio-Kil (p=0.0401). On the cuffs of sleeves treated with Bio-Kil, the mean count was 1,165 CFU/100 cm(2), markedly lower than that of 2,131 CFU/100 cm(2), found on the cuffs not treated with Bio-Kil (p=0.0073). With regard to the mean bacterial eradication rates of antimicrobial solutions, Steridal Solution, 75% alcohol and Bio-Kil (3rd generation) were shown to be the most effective, with rates exceeding 80%. Hibiscrub with paper towels and Fresh Protect Skin were the second most effective. Bio-Kil (1st generation), tap water with paper towels, liquid hand soap with paper towels and ozone water were the least effective. One important observation was that hand-washing without the use of paper towels increased the bacterial count by as much as 84% . Bio-Kil is effective in reducing bacterial counts in the air, on nursing staff uniforms and is an effective detergent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Yuanpei University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yung-Liang", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeh", "ForeName": "Ming-Yang", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Shau-Yen", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chi-Ming", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chi-Chen", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Hsu-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiu", "ForeName": "Tsan-Hung", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsia", "ForeName": "Te-Chun", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Jing-Gung", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Epidemics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hand Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Clothing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22200785", "10.3892/mmr.2011.730"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
