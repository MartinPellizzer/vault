The results showed that \u2460 the average concentrations of the maximum 8h average (O<sub>3</sub>-8h) for process 1 and process 3, which occurred from September 21<sup>st</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> and November 3<sup>rd</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> with the durations of 10 d and 9 d, were 145.52 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 143.55 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. Process 2 and process 4 occurred from October 18<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> and November 20<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup>, with the durations of 4 d and 6 d, and the average concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>-8h were 130.79 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and 115.46 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. \u2461 High air pressure, low precipitation and relative humidity, long sunshine duration, and strong solar radiation favored the occurrence of O<sub>3</sub>-polluted weather in Hainan province. Northerly wind was conducive to the increase in O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration, and wind speeds affected the regional distribution of high-value areas of O<sub>3</sub>-8h concentration in Hainan province. \u2462 Furthermore, process 1 and process 3 with more serious pollution had a larger air flow divergence, and there were two airflows originating from the inland area and the southeast coastal area, respectively. Air flow of process 2 and process 4 was relatively more concentrated with less O<sub>3</sub> pollution and was classified as southeast coastal air flow. 4 The analysis of potential contribution sources showed that transport from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces were the main sources of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Hainan province in autumn 2019. Among them, the weight potential source contribution function (WPSCF) and weight concentration weighted-trajectory (WCWT) values were larger than 0.36 and 90 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> in the PRD (Pearl River Delta) and western Guangdong province regions, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Institute of Meteorological Science, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Chuan-Bo", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Meteorological Observatory, Haikou 570203, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Haikou 571126, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-Shuai", "Initials": "WS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36437072", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202201225"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
