In this study, we first collected and schematically evaluated more than 500 Chinese domestic source profiles from literature and field measurements, and then established a most up-to-date dataset of VOCs source profiles in China by integrating 363 selective VOCs profiles into 101 sector-based source profiles. The profile dataset covers eight major source categories and contains 447 VOCs species including non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) species and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) species. The results shown that (1) VOCs composition characteristics exhibit variations for most Level-II source sectors and Level-III sub-sectors even under the same Level-I source category; (2) OVOCs, which were significantly missing in previous profiles, account for more than 95% in cooking and 20- 40% in non-road mobile, biomass burning and solvent use sources; (3) aromatics account for 20%-40% in most emission sources except cooking source, alkenes and alkynes account for ~20% in combustion sources (stationary combustion, mobile source and biomass burning), alkanes are abundant in gasoline-related emission sources(on-road mobile source and fuel oil storage and transportation); (4) missing OVOCs species could bring 30%-50% to ozone formation potentials in most emission sources; and (5) there are considerable differences in VOCs chemical groups and individual species for most emission sources between this dataset and the widely used U.S. SPECIATE database, indicating the importance of developing domestic VOCs source profiles. The dataset developed in this study can help support reactive VOCs species-based ozone control strategy and provide domestic profile data for source apportionment and air quality modeling in China and other countries or regions with similar emission source characteristics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
