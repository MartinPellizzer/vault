They are strongly dependent on meteorology, precursor emissions, and the ambient photochemical conditions. This study introduces a new pseudo-Lagrangian algorithm that identifies the spatiotemporal patterns of episodes, allowing for a good characterization of their areal extent and an assessment of their drivers. The algorithm has been used to identify ozone episodes in Europe from April to September over the last twenty years (2003-2022) in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis as well as in the historical simulation (1950-2014) and four shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs, spanning 2015-2100) of three Earth system models (UKESM1-0-LL, EC-Earth3-AerChem and GFDL-ESM4). While the total number of episodes has increased in recent years, the frequency of large episodes has decreased following European precursor emission reductions. The analysis of the 100 largest episodes shows that they tend to occur in Northern Europe during spring and in the center and south of the continent from June onwards. Most of the top 10 episodes occurred in the first years of the century and were associated with high temperatures, enhanced solar radiation, and anticyclonic conditions. Despite the decrease in large episodes in recent years, there is uncertainty regarding future European episodes. Episodes of reduced size are found for SSPs with weak greenhouse forcing and low precursor emissions, whereas episode sizes increase in scenarios with high methane concentrations and enhanced radiative forcing, even exceeding the maximum historical size. However, the three models project episodes of different sizes for any given scenario, probably associated with their differing warming trends and the varying level of complexity in the implementation of processes. These results point to the need to implement both effective climate and air quality policies to address the ozone air pollution problem in Europe in a warming climate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
