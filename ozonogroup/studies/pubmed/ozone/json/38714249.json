A total of 438 datapoints were collected from published works and distributed into 70% training and 30% test datasets while cross-validation was utilized to assess the training reliability. The models incorporated 15 input variables concerning reaction kinetics, molecular properties, hydrodynamic information, presence of radiation, and catalytic properties. It was observed that the Support Vector Regression (SVR) presented a poor performance as the \u03b5 hyperparameter ignored large error over low concentration levels. Meanwhile, the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model was able to provide rough estimations on the expected degradation of the pollutants without requiring information regarding reaction rate constants. The multi-objective optimization analysis suggested a leading role due to ozone kinetic for a rapid degradation of the contaminants and most of the results required intensification with hydrogen peroxide and Fenton process. Although both models were affected by accuracy limitations, this work provided a lightweight model to evaluate different Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) by providing general information regarding the process operational conditions as well as know molecular and catalytic properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
