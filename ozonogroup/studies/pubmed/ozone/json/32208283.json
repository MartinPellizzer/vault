The North China Plain (NCP) is a highly populated and relevant agricultural region in China, experiencing some of the highest ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations worldwide. It produces ~24% of the total maize production of China in years 2014-2017. For these years, we used observational O<sub>3</sub> data in combination with geostatistic methods to estimate county-level production and economic losses due to O<sub>3</sub> in the NCP. AOT40 (accumulated ozone exposure over an hourly threshold of 40\u00a0ppb) values during the maize growing season (90\u00a0days before maturity) progressively increased in the four consecutive years: 13.7\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 15.4\u00a0ppm\u00a0h, 16.9\u00a0ppm\u00a0h and 22.7\u00a0ppm\u00a0h. Mean relative yield losses were 8.2% in 2014, 9.2% in 2015, 10.4% in 2016 and 13.4% in 2017. These yield losses, derived from exposure-response functions, resulted in crop production losses of 530.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0t, 617.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0t, 713.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0t, and 953.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0t, as well as economic losses of 2343 million USD, 2672 million USD, 1887 million USD, and 2404 million USD from 2014 to 2017. The NCP is a key area in China for monitoring the effectiveness of the clean air action policies aiming at reducing emissions of air pollutants. Despite these measures, O<sub>3</sub> concentrations have increased in NCP, and reduction of this pollutant are challenging. We suggest an increase in the number of rural air quality stations for better characterizing O<sub>3</sub> trends in cropland areas, as well as the application of different mitigation measures. They may involve more stringent air quality regulations and changes in crops, breeding tolerant cultivars and a crop management taking into account O<sub>3</sub> pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
