Only English or German language studies were considered.", "Standard data items were extracted. Mean differences (MD) and standard mean differences (SMD) were primary effect measures. Changes were calculated for DMFRS/DFRS (decayed, missing, filled root surfaces), and RCI (root caries index). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and grading of evidence was performed according to the GRADE.", "Thirty trials reported in 34 studies involving 10,126 patients were included. Twenty-nine were RCTs, the other a controlled trial. Risk of bias was considered low for only five studies. In all 28 chemical agents were tested. Eleven studies assessed dentifrices; ten rinses; eight varnishes; three fluoride solutions; three gels; two ozone applications; one preventive dental regimen. Meta-analyses revealed that dentifrices containing 5,000 ppm F- (RR = 0.49; 95% CI= 0.42, 0.57; high level of evidence) or 1.5% arginine plus 1,450 ppm F- (RR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.98; very low level) are more effective in inactivating RCLs than dentifrices containing 1,100 to 1,450 ppm F-. Self-applied AmF/SnF2-containing dentifrice and rinse decreased the initiation of RCLs when compared with NaF products (SMD = 0.15; 95% CI = -0.22, 0.52; low level evidence). Mouth rinse containing 225 to 900 ppm F- revealed a significantly reduced DMFRS/DFRS (MD = -0.18; 95% CI = -0.35, -0.01; low level) when compared with a placebo rinse. Significantly reduced RCI was found for Chlorhexidine (MD = -0.67; 95% CI = -1.01, -0.32; very low level evidence) as well as SDF (MD = -0.33; 95% CI = -0.39, -0.28; very low level) when compared with placebo varnish.", "Based on meta-analysis, dentifrice containing 5,000 ppm F- and professionally applied CHX or SDF varnish may inactivate existing and/or reduce the initiation of RCLs. However, results should be interpreted with caution due to the low numbers of clinical trials for each agent, the high risk of bias within studies, and the limiting grade of evidence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cork University Dental School and Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "Martina", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Comment"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Evid Based Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "100883603", "ISSNLinking": "1462-0049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cariostatic Agents"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Dent Res. 2015 Feb;94(2):261-71. doi: 10.1177/0022034514557330", "PMID": "25398366"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cariostatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Root Caries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Oper Dent. 2002 Sep-Oct;27(5):430-7", "ArticleIdList": ["12216559"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Oral Investig. 2011 Feb;15(1):31-8", "ArticleIdList": ["19997859"]}, {"Citation": "Gerodontology. 2014 Jun;31(2):123-35", "ArticleIdList": ["23216625"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25909930", "10.1038/sj.ebd.6401074", "6401074"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
