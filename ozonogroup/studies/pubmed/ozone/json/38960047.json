This study investigates the effects of eO<sub>3</sub> concentrations on the mountain pine beetle which is a major tree-killing species of conifers in northwestern North America. We are particularly interested in understanding the effects of eO<sub>3</sub> concentrations on beetle behaviour and physiology and possible transgenerational impacts on bark beetle broods. We conducted O<sub>3</sub>-enrichment experiments in a controlled laboratory setting using different O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (100-200\u00a0ppb; projected for 2050-2100) and assessed various beetle responses, including CO<sub>2</sub> respiration, mating behaviour, survival probability, locomotion, and attraction behaviour. Transgenerational impacts on the first and second generations were also analyzed by studying brood morphology, mating behaviour, survival, and pheromone production. We found that beetles exposed to eO<sub>3</sub> concentrations had shorter oviposition galleries and reduced brood production. Beetle pheromones were also degraded by eO<sub>3</sub> exposure. However, exposure to eO<sub>3</sub> also prompted various adaptive responses in beetles. Despite reduced respiration, eO<sub>3</sub> improved locomotor activity and the olfactory response of beetles. Surprisingly, beetle survival probability was also improved both in the parents and their broods. We also observed transgenerational plasticity in the broods of eO<sub>3</sub>-exposed parents, suggesting potential stress resistance mechanisms. This was evident by similar mating success, oviposition gallery length, and brood numbers produced in both control and eO<sub>3</sub> concentration treatments. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of mountain pine beetles to increased O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, contributing crucial insights into the ecological implications of eO<sub>3</sub> concentrations on their populations. Overall, the outcome of this study contributes to informed climate change mitigation strategies and adaptive management practices for the development of resilient forests in response to emerging forest insect pests worldwide."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
