However, undesirable oxidation/disinfection byproducts such as bromate might form during ozonation. In this study, the UV absorbance and fluorescence indices were applied as surrogate indicators for predicting the inactivation of bacteria and formation of bromate during ozonation of water and wastewater effluents. The inactivation efficiencies of lab-cultured Escherichia coli (E. coli) and autochthonous bacteria were measured by plating (for E.\u00a0coli only) and flow cytometry with fluorescence staining. During ozonation of E.\u00a0coli spiked into wastewater effluents (\u223c10<sup>6</sup>\u202fcell/mL), the priority of inactivation efficiency determined by different cell viability methods were in the order of CFU\u202f>\u202fmembrane damage\u202f>\u202fDNA damage. Approximately, 99% membrane damage and/or 90% DNA damage are conservatively supposed as an indicator for sufficient bacterial inactivation as well as degradation of antibiotic resistance genes. The related required O<sub>3</sub> dosing thresholds for sufficient inactivation of E.\u00a0coli and autochthonous bacteria refer to \u223c0.6 O<sub>3</sub>/DOC (g/g), \u223c50% decrease of UVA254, \u223c60% decrease of UVA280, or \u223c80% decrease of humic-like fluorescence. Within the range of 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>8</sup>\u202fcell/mL, the bacterial concentration did not have significant effects on the required thresholds of the specific O<sub>3</sub> doses or spectroscopic indicators required for bacterial inactivation. The addition of 50\u202fmM tert-BuOH as \u00b7OH scavenger increased the required specific ozone doses but decreased the losses of spectroscopic indicators necessary for sufficient bacterial inactivation, and also suggested that the membrane/DNA damages for bacterial inactivation were mainly attributed to the direct O<sub>3</sub> attacks. The bromate concentration was determined using ion chromatography with MS/MS detection. The results showed that when O<sub>3</sub> was dosed at the required thresholds for sufficient bacterial inactivation, bromate formation could usually be suppressed below 10\u202f\u03bcg/L. The present work supports that it is possible to reach a balance between bacterial inactivation and bromate formation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
