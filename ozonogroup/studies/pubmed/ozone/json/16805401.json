Governing factors, such as the initial molar ratio of ozone (O3) to PG-MEA, UV volumetric electric power input, and moisture content in the influent airstream, were investigated. A 1-L batch reactor was used to investigate some photodegradation characteristics of PGMEA in advance. Experiments were conducted at a fixed influent PGMEA concentration of approximately 50 ppm and an ambient temperature of 26 degrees C. A gas space time of 85 sec in the plug-flow reactor was kept for either ozonation or photolysis reaction, whereas a gas space time of 170 sec was used for the UV/O3 degradation. Results show that an initial molar ratio of O3 to PGMEA of >2.91 and an UV volumetric electric input power of 0.294 W/L(-1) sufficed to obtain PGMEA decompositions of >90% by UV/O3. Kinetic analyses indicate that all types of PGMEA decomposition are pseudo-first order with respect to its concentration. Moisture content (relative humidity = 15-99%) and UV volumetric electric input power (0.147 and 0.294 W/L(-1)) were major factors that strongly affect the PGMEA degradation rate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan, Republic of China. ms.chou@msa.hinet.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "Ming-Shean", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Bo-Jen", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hsiao-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Air Waste Manag Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9503111", "ISSNLinking": "1096-2247"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Industrial Waste"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "propylene glycol methyl ether acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Waste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Propylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Management"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16805401", "10.1080/10473289.2006.10464488"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
