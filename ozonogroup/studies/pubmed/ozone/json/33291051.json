The goal was to assess whether a defective atToc132/120 receptor would alter the mutant's response to ozone-induced stress. Increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in wildtype plants that were exposed to ozone for 3\u00a0h and left in an ozone-free environment for 21\u00a0h. The increased levels of MDA were not positively correlated with changes in the levels of triunsaturated fatty acids from which MDA is derived. In both the wildtype and mutant plants, absolute amounts of the glycerolipids were not altered by ozone treatment. The untreated mutant, however, accumulated decreased levels of chloroplast lipids and triunsaturated fatty acids. In ozone-treated wildtype, the levels of 16:3 were significantly decreased and this was mirrored by decreased levels of TOC132 and FAD5 transcripts, and increased levels of SP1 E3 ligase transcripts. These data suggest a possible increase in protein ubiquitination under ozone-induced stress. In contrast, in ozone-treated mutant, the FAD5 transcripts accumulated at the control level. The untreated mutant, however, accumulated significantly increased levels of CAT1 and FAD7 transcripts, which indicates that a defective chloroplast receptor induced cellular stress. In ozone-treated wildtype, there was a small increase in 34:6-phosphatidic acid, which indicates that a small amount of the chloroplast-derived MGDG was degraded in response to ozone-induced stress. Overall, these data indicate that the wildtype and mutant responded differently in lipid composition and oxidation to ozone-induced stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
