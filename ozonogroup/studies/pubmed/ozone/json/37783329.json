Environmental factors significantly shape plant ecology. Human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to global temperature rise, impacting various aspects, including carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2)</sub> concentration, temperature, ozone (O<sub>3)</sub>, and ultraviolet-B, all of which influence plant diseases. Altered pathogen ranges can accelerate disease transmission. This review explores environmental effects on plant diseases, with climate change affecting fungal biogeography, disease incidence, and severity, as well as agricultural production. Moreover, we have discussed how climate change influences pathogen development, host-fungal interactions, the emergence of new races of fungi, and the dissemination of emerging fungal diseases across the globe. The discussion about environment-mediated impact on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), effector-triggered immunity (ETI), and RNA interference (RNAi) is also part of this review. In conclusion, the review underscores the critical importance of understanding how climate change is reshaping plant-fungal interactions. It highlights the need for continuous research efforts to elucidate the mechanisms driving these changes and their ecological consequences. As the global climate continues to evolve, it is imperative to develop innovative strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of fungal pathogens on plant health and food security."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
