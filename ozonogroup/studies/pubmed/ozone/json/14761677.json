We tested the hypothesis that the environmental stresses of ozone (O(3)) and house dust mite allergen (HDMA) in atopic infant rhesus monkeys alter the distribution of airway nerves. Midlevel bronchi and bronchioles from 6-month-old infant monkeys that inhaled filtered air (FA), house dust mite allergen HDMA, O(3), or HDMA + O(3) for 11 episodes (5 days each, 0.5 ppm O(3), 8 h/day followed by 9 days recovery) were examined using immunohistochemistry for the presence of Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), a nonspecific neural indicator, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Along the axial path between the sixth and the seventh intrapulmonary airway generations, there were small significant (P < 0.05) decrements in the density of epithelial nerves in monkeys exposed to HDMA or O(3), while in monkeys exposed to HDMA + O(3) there was a greater significant (P < 0.05) reduction in epithelial innervation. In animals exposed to O(3) or HDMA + O(3) there was a significant increase in the number of PGP 9.5 positive/CGRP negative cells that were anchored to the basal lamina and emitted projections in primarily the lateral plain and often intertwined with projections and cell bodies of other similar cells. We conclude that repeated cycles of acute injury and repair associated with the episodic pattern of ozone and allergen exposure alter the normal development of neural innervation of the epithelial compartment and the appearance of a new population of undefined PGP 9.5 positive cells within the epithelium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Cell Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California-Davis, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larson", "ForeName": "Shawnessy D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schelegle", "ForeName": "Edward S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walby", "ForeName": "William F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gershwin", "ForeName": "Laural J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fanuccihi", "ForeName": "Michelle V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joad", "ForeName": "Jesse P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tarkington", "ForeName": "Brian K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hyde", "ForeName": "Dallas M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Plopper", "ForeName": "Charles G", "Initials": "CG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES 00628", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES 006791", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL 07013", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Appl Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0416575", "ISSNLinking": "0041-008X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatophagoides farinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macaca mulatta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Confocal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neural Conduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["innervation", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Olfactory Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14761677", "10.1016/j.taap.2003.09.025", "S0041008X03004691"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
