The last decade has witnessed an upsurge of metal-based methods that can transfer CF<sub>2</sub>H to C(sp<sup>2</sup>) sites both in stoichiometric and catalytic mode. Difluoromethylation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-H bond has also been accomplished through Minisci-type radical chemistry, a strategy best applied to heteroaromatics. Examples of electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical and cross-coupling methods have appeared to construct C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-CF<sub>2</sub>H bonds, but cases of stereoselective difluoromethylation are still limited. In this sub-field, an exciting departure is the precise site-selective installation of CF<sub>2</sub>H onto large biomolecules such as proteins. The formation of X-CF<sub>2</sub>H bond where X is oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur is conventionally achieved upon reaction with ClCF<sub>2</sub>H; more recently, numerous protocols have achieved X-H insertion with novel non-ozone depleting difluorocarbene reagents. All together, these advances have streamlined access to molecules of pharmaceutical relevance, and generated interest for process chemistry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Oxford University, OX1 3TA Oxford, UK. veronique.gouverneur@chem.ox.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Sap", "ForeName": "Jeroen B I", "Initials": "JBI", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meyer", "ForeName": "Claudio F", "Initials": "CF", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Straathof", "ForeName": "Natan J W", "Initials": "NJW", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwumene", "ForeName": "Ndidi", "Initials": "N", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Am Ende", "ForeName": "Christopher W", "Initials": "CW", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Trabanco", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9s A", "Initials": "AA", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gouverneur", "ForeName": "V\u00e9ronique", "Initials": "V", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Soc Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "0335405", "ISSNLinking": "0306-0012"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34075979", "10.1039/d1cs00360g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
