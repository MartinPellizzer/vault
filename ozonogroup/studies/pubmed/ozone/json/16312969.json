The CoxB3 virus was seeded to sterilized secondary effluent to make a raw water of known pathogenic level. After applying the raw water to each treatment or disinfection process, the residual virus in the finished water was concentrated, and virus assay was carried out by the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose technique. TCID50 was used as an indicative parameter of CoxB3 virus in the raw and treated water. Parallel experiments were also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each process for the removal of coliform bacteria. It was noticed from the experiment that both coagulation-filtration and ultrafiltration could achieve substantial removal of TCID50 at about the same level (2-log removal). However, the effect of the two processes on the removal of coliform bacteria was much different: 2-log removal by coagulation-filtration and 4 to 5-log removal by ultrafiltration. The TCID50 removal correlates more closely with the removal of turbidity than that of coliform bacteria. Chlorine was found to be effective in coliform removal but almost had no effect on TCID50. As ozone was applied, a high removal of both coliform bacteria and TCID50 could be obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, China. xcwang@xauat.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "X C", "Initials": "XC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "X P", "Initials": "XP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterovirus B, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16312969"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
