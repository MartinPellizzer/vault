The box model gave a good prediction of the photochemical pollution with minimal investment. As expected, the peak ozone in summer is higher than in winter. The NOx concentrations in winter are higher than those in summer. In summer, NO and NO2 have one peak in the morning. In winter, NO and NO2 show two peaks during the day. Three model runs including no reactions, a zero ozone boundary condition and dark reactions were conducted to understand the photochemical processes. The effects of emission reduction on the formation of the photochemical pollution in the center of Tokyo have been studied. The results show that the reduction of NMHC emission can decrease the ozone, however, the reduction of NOx emission can increase the ozone. It can be concluded that if the NOx emission are reduced, the reduction of NMHC should be more emphasized in order to decrease the ozone concentration in the center of Tokyo, Japan, especially the reduction of the NMHC from stationary source emission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical System Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan. hong@explosion.chem.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akustu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arai", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tamura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S7G510RUBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11444304", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00189-2", "S0045-6535(00)00189-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
