Other studies failed to confirm this effect.

After each exposure, the subject was challenged with allergen (nine with grass pollen extract and six with ragweed extract) and allergen PC15 was measured.", "Ozone preexposure did not affect allergen PC15 when compared with clean air preexposure (allergen PC15 dilution 1/114 vs 1/119, respectively).
