The decline in Kenya's growth rate was attributed to high female literacy and reduced infant mortality. Another strategy for enhancing fertility decline is to reduce child mortality, particularly from preventable causes such as diarrhea. The entire cost of such a strategy to reduce preventable disease would be about $1.33 per 300 million taxpayers in developed countries. Family planning services must be expanded. Prevention of maternal mortality and AIDS would bring major benefits. Strategies for environmental protection emphasized the already existing plan of action set out in the UNCED document Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro. The plan has suffered from inaction. The estimated cost of $625 million was considered to be several times smaller than the costs of inaction. The elimination of subsidies in tropical forests would have an immediate impact. Natural resource accounting at the national level would include the value of natural resources. Pricing would change radically for gasoline if the costs of urban smog, acid rain, low-level ozone pollution, and global warming were taken into account. Strategies for sustainable development pertained to the preceding strategies and others indicated in the Agenda 21 Action Plan. If funding were better targeted to the poorest 20% of global population with high fertility rates, the accomplishments would be heralded. 1.2 million are living in absolute poverty, and aid for nutrition, primary health care, water and sanitation, basic education, and family planning amounts to only 10% of expenditures. An increase to 20% would mean a contribution from Americans of $7.50 per person or 33% of $25 thousand million from all developed countries. Developing countries need to lower their military expenditures, privatize public enterprises, change inappropriate development policies, eliminate corruption, and improve national governance. The debt burden should be reduced."]}], "OtherID": ["8029724", "104988", "00240622"], "PMID": "12288797", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "07", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0376-8929", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "20", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1993", "Season": "Autumn"}}, "Title": "Environmental conservation", "ISOAbbreviation": "Environ Conserv"}, "ArticleTitle": "Population, environment, and development.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "205", "EndPage": "216", "MedlinePgn": "205-16"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myers", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Environ Conserv", "NlmUniqueID": "9876011", "ISSNLinking": "0376-8929"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Growth"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12288797", "10.1017/s0376892900022980"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
