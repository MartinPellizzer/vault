Compared with the control, enhanced UV-B radiation significantly inhibited pollen germination and tube growth in most species. Higher UV-B flux rate caused greater inhibitory effect than lower UV-B radiation level. Several test plants exhibited insensitivity, even stimulation of pollen germination and tube growth to UV-B. The reduction in pollen germination rate and tube growth increased with exposure time, which indicated a cumulative effect of UV-B radiation. It is concluded that changes in pollen susceptibility to UV-B would have a serious ecological consequence under natural conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Key State Laboratory of Arid Agroecology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000. fenghy@lzu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Huyuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Lizhe", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Lingling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Zongdong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xunling", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12385209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
