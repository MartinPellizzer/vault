Studies that consider the unique mixture of pollutants and the health data specific to a city provide additional information for asthma self-management. This framework is applied to air pollution and asthma data to identify supplemental warning days in Houston, Texas.", "A four-step framework was established to identify days with pollutant levels that pose meaningful increased risk for asthma attacks compared with baseline. Historical associations between 18,542 ambulance-treated asthma attacks and air pollutant concentrations in Houston, Texas (2004-2016; analyzed in 2018), were analyzed using a case-crossover study design with conditional logistic regression. Days with historically high associations between pollution and asthma attacks were identified as supplemental warning days.", "Days with 8-hour maximum ozone >66.6 parts per billion for the 3 previous days and same-day 24-hour nitrogen dioxide >19.3 parts per billion pose an RR of 15% above baseline; concentrations above these levels pose an increased risk of 15% (RR=1.15, 95% CI=1.14, 1.16) and 30% (RR=1.30, 95% CI=1.29, 1.32), respectively. These warnings add an additional 12% days per year over the AQI warnings.", "Houston uses this framework to identify supplemental air quality warnings to improve asthma self-management. Supplemental days reflect risk lower than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and consecutive poor air quality days, differing from the AQI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
