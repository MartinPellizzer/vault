The VOC content levels, source profiles, emission factors and inventories, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA formation, and priority control strategies were investigated from the source. One hundred sixty-eight representative woodenware coatings were sampled, and VOC species and contents were determined. The VOC, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA emission factors per gram of coatings for three types of woodenware coatings were quantified. The total VOC, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA emissions from wooden furniture-manufacturing industry in 2019 were 976,976\u00a0t/a, 2,840,282\u00a0t/a, 24,970\u00a0t/a, and solvent-based coatings accounted for 98.53\u00a0%, 99.17\u00a0% and 99.6\u00a0% of the total VOC, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA emissions, respectively. Aromatics and esters were major organic groups, contributing 49.80\u00a0% and 36.03\u00a0% to total VOC emissions, respectively. Aromatics contributed 86.14\u00a0% and 100\u00a0% to total O<sub>3</sub> and SOA emissions, respectively. The top 10 species contributing to VOC, O<sub>3</sub> and SOA had been identified. Four benzene series, including o-Xylene, m-Xylene, toluene and ethylbenzene, were ranked as the first-class priority control species, accounting for 85.90\u00a0% and 99.89\u00a0% of the total O<sub>3</sub> and SOA, respectively. Priority should be given to solvent-based coatings, aromatics and four benzene series for future O<sub>3</sub> and SOA reduction for wooden furniture-manufacturing industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
