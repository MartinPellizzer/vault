To this end, a comparison is presented of the experimental results obtained from ozone treatment using atmospheric air as the feed gas (Experiment I, [O3]\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0gN/m(3)), with and without addition of H2O2, and those obtained under the same conditions but using concentrated oxygen as the feed gas, obtained by pressure swing adsorption technology (Experiment II, [O3]\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0gN/m(3)). All tests were conducted using a pilot scale reactor. Under (Experiment II) conditions, degradation exceeded 99% and up to 60% mineralization was achieved for initial compound concentrations, and hydraulic retention time was reduced by 75% compared to (Experiment I). The results of toxicity tests show through increasing the production of ozone gas in (Experiment II), toxicity was eliminated at initial study concentrations of \u22641\u00a0mg/l for all treatment times studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
