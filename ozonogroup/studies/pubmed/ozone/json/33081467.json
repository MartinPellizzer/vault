Because they are amphipathic, many fatty acids are surface active and prone to enrichment at the air-water interface. Here, we report that by using nonanoic acid (NA) as a model fatty acid, coexisting Fe(III), even at concentrations as low as 1 \u03bcM, markedly enhanced the photochemical release of NA-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as octanal and octane into the air. Further studies indicated that the surface-enriched fatty acids dramatically increase the local concentration of Fe(III) at the water surface, which enables Fe(III)-mediated photochemical reactions to take place at the air-water interface, and the VOCs facilely produced by fatty acid photooxidation can then be released into the air. Moreover, the product distribution in the Fe(III)-mediated reactions was largely different from that in other photochemical systems, and a mechanism based on photochemical decarboxylation is proposed. Considering that the coexistence of fatty acids and Fe(III) in the environment is common, the enhanced photochemical release of VOCs by surface-enriched fatty acids and Fe(III) may be an important channel for the atmospheric emission of VOCs, which are known to play an essential role in the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Key Laboratory of Photochemistry, CAS Research/Education Center for Excellence in Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, P.
