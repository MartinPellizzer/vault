In conventional biological treatment, only a moderate removal was achieved, and thus, STG can be detected in WWTP effluents with concentrations in the higher ng/L range. Ozonation is a widely discussed technique for advanced wastewater treatment. In lab-scale experiments, STG showed pH-dependent removal kinetics with a maximum apparent rate constant of k \u223c1 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH \u2265 9. With an apparent rate constant of k<sub>O3</sub> = (1.8 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at pH 8, STG can be considered to be readily degraded by ozonation of WWTP effluents. Ozone attacks the primary amine moiety of STG, leading to nitro-STG (TP 437) (the primary amine moiety is transformed into a nitro group). Furthermore, a diketone (TP 406) was formed, which can be further degraded by ozone. Lab-scale and pilot-scale experiments on ozonation of WWTP effluents confirmed that the ozone attack of STG was incomplete even at high ozone doses of 1.7 and 0.9 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg DOC, respectively. These experiments confirmed that nitro-STG was formed as the main TP in the wastewater matrix. Two other TPs, TP 421c and TP 206b, were also detected, albeit with low intensities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology, Mainzer Tor 1, Koblenz 56068, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hermes", "ForeName": "Nina", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology, Mainzer Tor 1, Koblenz 56068, Germany."}], "LastName": "Jewell", "ForeName": "Kevin S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Lund University, PO Box 124, Lund 221 00, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Fal\u00e5s", "ForeName": "Per", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6386-690X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 5, Essen 45141, Germany."}], "LastName": "Lutze", "ForeName": "Holger V", "Initials": "HV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology, Mainzer Tor 1, Koblenz 56068, Germany."}], "LastName": "Wick", "ForeName": "Arne", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2615-7925"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Hydrology, Mainzer Tor 1, Koblenz 56068, Germany."}], "LastName": "Ternes", "ForeName": "Thomas A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TS63EW8X6F", "NameOfSubstance": "Sitagliptin Phosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sitagliptin Phosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Waste Disposal, Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32867484", "10.1021/acs.est.0c01454"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
