However, the evaluations presented in the NexGen report would benefit from more thorough consideration of several essential components of a critical review of toxicity data, e.g., data quality, data relevance, and the extent to which the test endpoints reflect adverse effects. Such considerations are necessary to ensure that the NexGen report evaluations--and the resulting conclusions and recommendations--are grounded in scientifically sound, representative data reviews. We illustrate these concerns with a critique of the report's prototype ozone evaluation. Although substantial additional research is needed before new toxicity data types can be used reliably in rigorous risk assessment applications, they clearly offer exciting opportunities for advancing toxicological science and risk assessment. By explicitly identifying limitations still to be addressed and providing stronger guideposts for future research needs, the NexGen report could serve an influential role in achieving the promise of these new research approaches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.
