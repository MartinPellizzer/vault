The reduction of N<sub>2</sub> O into N<sub>2</sub> by microorganisms carrying the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ) is the only known biological process eliminating this greenhouse gas. Recent studies showed that a previously unknown clade of N<sub>2</sub> O-reducers (nosZII) was related to the potential capacity of the soil to act as a N<sub>2</sub> O sink. However, little is known about how this group responds to different agricultural practices. Here, we investigated how N<sub>2</sub> O-producers and N<sub>2</sub> O-reducers were affected by agricultural practices across a range of cropping systems in order to evaluate the consequences for N<sub>2</sub> O emissions. The abundance of both ammonia-oxidizers and denitrifiers was quantified by real-time qPCR, and the diversity of nosZ clades was determined by 454 pyrosequencing. Denitrification and nitrification potential activities as well as in\u00a0situ N<sub>2</sub> O emissions were also assessed. Overall, greatest differences in microbial activity, diversity, and abundance were observed between sites rather than between agricultural practices at each site. To better understand the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to the in\u00a0situ N<sub>2</sub> O emissions, we subdivided more than 59,000 field measurements into fractions from low to high rates. We found that the low N<sub>2</sub> O emission rates were mainly explained by variation in soil properties (up to 59%), while the high rates were explained by variation in abundance and diversity of microbial communities (up to 68%). Notably, the diversity of the nosZII clade but not of the nosZI clade was important to explain the variation of in\u00a0situ N<sub>2</sub> O emissions. Altogether, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the response of N<sub>2</sub> O-reducing bacteria to agricultural practices and how it may ultimately affect N<sub>2</sub> O emissions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Global Change Biology \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
