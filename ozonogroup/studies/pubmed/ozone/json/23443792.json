The foam appearance and microscopic structure of the materials were observed, and tensile tests and Raman spectrum scan were performed assess the effect of ozonated water. Simulated VSD devices were prepared and tested for leakproofness under negative pressure after ozonated water treatment.", "zonated water treatment for 8 days caused no obvious abnormal changes in the foam appearance or microscopic structure of the materials. The maximum tensile load of foam before and after ozonated water treatment was 4.25\u22130.73 kgf and 2.44\u22130.19 kgf (P=0.000), the momentary distance when the foam torn before and after intervention was 92.54\u221312.83 mm and 64.44\u22134.60 mm, respectively (P=0.000). The corresponding results for VSD sealing membrane were 0.70\u22130.58 kgf and 0.71\u22130.08 kgf (P=0.698), and 99.30\u221310.27 mm and 100.95\u221318.22 mm (P=0.966), respectively.
