This response was mediated by statistically significant increases in O(3)-induced daily sap flow and led to seasonal losses in stem growth of 30-50% for most species in a high-O(3) year. * Decreased growth and increased water use of mature forest trees under episodically high ambient O(3) concentrations suggest that O(3) will amplify the adverse effects of increasing temperatures on forest growth and forest hydrology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge, TN, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McLaughlin", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Calgary, Calgary Alberta, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nosal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge, TN, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wullschleger", "ForeName": "S D", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Forest Service, Southern Global Change Program, Raleigh, NC, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "New Phytol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882884", "ISSNLinking": "0028-646X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Appalachian Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Broadmeadow M. 1998.
