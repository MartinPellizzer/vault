Two uninjured sections of leaf tissue were sampled from a single leaf collected from each of 12 open-grown O(3)-tolerant and 12 O(3)-sensitive seedlings. Standard histological techniques and light microscopy were used to examine 11 morphological characteristics. The O(3)-sensitive genotype had significantly greater stomatal density, thinner palisade mesophyll layer and thicker spongy mesophyll layer, lower ratio of palisade to spongy mesophyll, greater leaf weight and leaf area. In addition, total leaf thickness, guard cell length, and specific leaf mass were also slightly greater for the O(3)-sensitive genotype."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Environmental Resource Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. jxf123@psu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferdinand", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fredericksen", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kouterick", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skelly", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15092960", "10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00078-0", "S0269-7491(99)00078-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
