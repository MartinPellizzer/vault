In this paper, ozonolysis of model lung phospholipids intervened by salt cations in SSAs at air-water interface was investigated using acoustic levitation-nano-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (AL-nano-ESI-MS). The cation species facilitated the interfacial ozonolysis of phospholipids, and this increased ozonolysis showed a dependence on the concentration of salt cations. The charge number and ion radius of salt cations were also investigated, and the times of increased efficiency for phospholipids ozonolysis at the air-water interface were higher with more charge numbers or lower ion radius. The mechanism study revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the electronegative headgroup of phospholipids and the cations disturbed the packing of phospholipids, and resulted in oleyl chains more vulnerable with ozone. Finally, aerosolization of the salt-dominated artificial seawater and real seawater revealed a significant increase on ozonolysis of phospholipid intervened by salt cations. These results reveal SSAs intervening phospholipids interfacial reaction at the molecule level, which will be beneficial to gain the knowledge of the negative health effect concerning the components involved in SSAs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
