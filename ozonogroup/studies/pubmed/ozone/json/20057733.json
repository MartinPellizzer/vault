With the largest available balloons and a large telescope one can get sufficiently above the ozone to make precise polarization measurements of stars and planets near 2820 A and 2200 A. Two telescope/gondola systems are in operation. The first actually is a prototype for spacecraft but it is also used on balloons, mounted in a gondola of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It has two 7.5-cm reflecting telescopes (7.5 cm is the diameter of the primary mirror). The second system has a 71-cm Cassegrain reflector, two vidicon cameras, command and telemetry by radio link, and a startracker that guides the stabilized platform (+/-1 min of arc). The first measurements made were of the polarization of the moon at 2900 A in December 1965, and of interstellar polarization at 2820 A and 2200 A in May 1966."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lunar and Planetary Laboratory ofThe University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gehrels", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Opt", "NlmUniqueID": "0247660", "ISSNLinking": "1559-128X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1967", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1967", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20057733", "10.1364/AO.6.000231", "14556"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
