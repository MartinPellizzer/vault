Gas phase chemiluminescence (GPCL) measurement of arsenic is made in an automated batch system with arsenic in situ electroreduced to arsine that is reacted with ozone to emit light. The ozone is generated from oxygen that is simultaneously anodically produced. Of 22 different electrode materials studied, graphite was chosen as the cathode. As(V) is reduced much less efficiently to AsH(3) than As(III). Prereducing all As to As(III) is difficult in the field and tedious. Oxidizing all As to As(V) is simple (e.g., with NaOCl) but greatly reduces subsequent conversion to AsH(3) and hence sensitivity. The rate of the AsH(3)-O(3) GPCL reaction and hence signal intensity increases with [O(3)]. Using oxygen to feed the ozonizer produces higher [O(3)] and substantial signal enhancement. This makes it practical to measure all arsenic as As(V). The system exhibits an LOD (S/N = 3) for total arsenic as As(V) of 0.36 microg/L (5 mL sample). Comparison of total As results in native and spiked water samples with those from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and other techniques show high correlation (r(2) = 0.9999) and near unity slopes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Arlington, Planetarium Place, Arlington, Texas 76019-0065, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sengupta", "ForeName": "Mrinal K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sawalha", "ForeName": "Maather F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohira", "ForeName": "Shin-Ichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Idowu", "ForeName": "Ademola D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dasgupta", "ForeName": "Purnendu K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7CIZ75ZPN", "NameOfSubstance": "arsenic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1I29R0RJQ", "NameOfSubstance": "arsine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20380446", "10.1021/ac100604y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
