Also, their catalytic performance on ozone decomposition was investigated following the order of Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> < Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> < MnO<sub>2</sub> < MnO<sub>2</sub>-H-200. In combination with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), O<sub>2</sub>-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization, it was deduced that the superior O<sub>3</sub> decomposition capacity for MnO<sub>2</sub>-H-200 was strongly associated with abundant oxygen vacancies on its surface. Among Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and MnO<sub>2</sub>, the difference in O<sub>3</sub> decomposition efficiency was dependent on the divergent nature of oxygen vacancy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub> possessed lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy, while MnO<sub>2</sub> had the minimum desorption energy of peroxide species (O<sub>2</sub>*). It was deduced that the promotion of the O<sub>3</sub> decomposition capability was attributed to the easier O<sub>2</sub>* desorption. Insights into the deactivation mechanism for MnO<sub>2</sub>-H-200 further validated the assumptions. As the reaction proceeded, adsorbed oxygen species accumulated on the catalyst surface, and a portion of them were transformed to lattice oxygen. The consumption of oxygen vacancy led to the deactivation of the catalyst."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian National Laboratory for Clean Energy, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, P.
