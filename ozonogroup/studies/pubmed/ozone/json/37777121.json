This study combined the generalized additive model (GAM) and the observation-based model (OBM) to explore the vertical characteristics and drivers of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) based on meteorology tower (200\u00a0m) data to quantify the effects of factors and photochemical reactions on O<sub>3</sub> formation at different heights. The F values of GAM reflect the importance of each factor, indicating that NO (F is 33.99 in the peak season, 36.72 in the non-peak season) was the dominant driver of O<sub>3</sub> and was more important in the lower layer (20-116\u00a0m). Temperature (F is 35.42) was the main contributor to O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the peak season, especially for O<sub>3</sub> in the upper layer (116-200\u00a0m). The net O<sub>3</sub> production rate in the peak season was 1.47 times that in the non-peak season due to strong photochemical reactions and meteorological conditions. And the net O<sub>3</sub> production rate decreased sharply with increasing height in the two seasons. Less net O<sub>3</sub> production in the upper layer was accompanied by a higher O<sub>3</sub> mixing ratio, which indicated that there was more background O<sub>3</sub> in the upper layer. OBM model results showed that the reaction between hydroperoxyl radical (HO<sub>2</sub>) and NO was the primary contribution pathway, accounting for 54.00\u00a0% and 57.50\u00a0% in the peak and non-peak seasons, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> formation was highly sensitive to VOCs, while NOx reduction could have positive or negative effects on O<sub>3</sub> depending on the levels of hydroxyl radical (OH). The understanding of the formation mechanism of O<sub>3</sub> and the influence of NO on O<sub>3</sub> provides insights into the importance of anthropogenic activities at urban canopy heights in shaping the vertical structure of O<sub>3</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
