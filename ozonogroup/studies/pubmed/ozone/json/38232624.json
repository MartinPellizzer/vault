Information was charted for comparison of evidence, including pollutant(s) studied, exposure assessment, biomarker measurement, analysis method, study population, size, dates, adjustment variables, and findings.", "Several common air pollutants (including two mixtures) and a few dozen occupational inhalants were assessed in 13 eligible studies. Associations between industrial sulfur dioxide and particulate matter less than 2.5\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter with ACPA were observed most frequently, including associations between residential proximity to pollution sources and ACPA positivity. Consistency of associations with other pollutants was either not observed or limited to single studies. Three studies evaluated the modifying impact of SE alleles (a genetic factor associated with RA) and found that pollutant associations were stronger among participants positive for SE alleles.", "Based on mixed results, there was no consistent link between any single pollutant and RA-related biomarker outcomes. Comparisons across studies were limited by differences in study populations (e.g., by RA status, by sociodemographic groups) and study design (including designs focused on different sources of air pollution, methodological approaches with varying levels of potential exposure misclassification, and assessments of inconsistent biomarker cut-points). However, given that multiple studies reported associations between exposure to air pollution and RA biomarkers, continued exploration utilizing studies that can be designed with a more robust causal framework, including continued consideration of effect modification by genetic status, may be necessary."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
