Relevant also to smog and ozone cycles, together these processes span a wide range of temperatures. Remarkably, high-resolution NO<sub>2</sub> electronic absorption spectra have only been reported in a narrow range below about 300 K. Previously, we reported [ <i>J. Phys. Chem. A</i> 2021, 125, 5519-5533] the construction of quasi-diabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the lowest four electronic states (X\u0303, \u00c3, B\u0303, and C\u0303) of NO<sub>2</sub>. In addition to three-dimensional PESs based on explicitly correlated MRCI(Q)-F12/VTZ-F12 <i>ab initio</i> data, the geometry dependence of each component of the dipoles and transition dipoles was also mapped into fitted surfaces. The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method was then used to compute the 0 K electronic absorption spectrum (from the ground rovibrational initial state) employing those energy and transition dipole surfaces. Here, in an extension of that work, we report an investigation into the effects of elevated temperature on the spectrum, considering the effects of the population of rotationally and vibrationally excited initial states. The calculations are complemented by new experimental measurements. Spectral contributions from hundreds of rotational states up to <i>N</i> = 20 and from 200 individually-characterized vibrational states were computed. A spectral simulation tool was developed that enables modeling the spectrum at various temperatures\u2500by weighting individual spectral contributions via the partition function, or for pure excited initial states, which can be probed via transient absorption spectroscopy. We validate these results against experimental absorption spectroscopy data at high temperatures, as well as via a new measurement from the (1,0,1) initial vibrational state."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICTP-East African Institute for Fundamental Research, University of Rwanda, Kigali 4285, Rwanda."}], "LastName": "Ndengu\u00e9", "ForeName": "Steve", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4378-8745"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 65409-0010, United States."}], "LastName": "Quintas-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Ernesto", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2493-4671"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri 65409-0010, United States."}], "LastName": "Dawes", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California 94551, United States."}], "LastName": "Blackstone", "ForeName": "Christopher C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4304-8218"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Combustion Research Facility, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, California 94551, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States."}], "LastName": "Osborn", "ForeName": "David L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Phys Chem A", "NlmUniqueID": "9890903", "ISSNLinking": "1089-5639"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37384555", "10.1021/acs.jpca.3c02832"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
