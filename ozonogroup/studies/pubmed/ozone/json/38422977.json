Consequently, we propose the hypothesis that (i) ROS may be generated during the process of nanobubble generation through water splitting, and (ii) bulk nanobubbles possess electrochemical reactivity, which could potentially lead to continuous ROS generation even after the cessation of nanobubble production.", "A comprehensive set of experiments was conducted to generate nanobubbles in pure water using the water-splitting method. The primary aims of this study are as follows: (i) nanobubble generation by electrolysis and its characterization; (ii) to provide conclusive evidence that the nano-entities are indeed nanobubbles; (iii) to quantify the production of reactive oxygen species during the process of nanobubble generation and (iv) to establish evidence for the presence of electrochemically reactive nanobubbles. The findings of our experiment suggest that bulk nanobubbles possess the ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the process of nanobubble nucleation. Additionally, our results indicate that bulk nanobubbles are electrochemically reactive after the cessation of nanobubble production. The electron spin spectroscopy (ESR) response and degradation of the dye compound over time confirm the electrochemical reactivity of bulk nanobubbles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
