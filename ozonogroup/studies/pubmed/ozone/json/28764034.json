Firstly, the different concentrations of ozonated water were used to make SBWN. Subsequently, SBWN prepared with ozonated water were packaged under six different conditions and stored for 11days. Changes in microbial, chemical-physical, textural properties and sensorial qualities of SWBN were monitored during storage. Microbiological results indicated that adopting 2.21mg/L of ozonated water resulted in a 1.8 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g reduction of the initial microbial loads in SBWN. In addition, MAP suppressed the microbial growth with a concomitant reduction in the rates of acidification and quality deteriorations of SBWN. Finally, the shelf-life of sample packed under N<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub>=30:70 was extended to 9days, meanwhile textural and sensorial characteristics were maintained during the whole storage period."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
