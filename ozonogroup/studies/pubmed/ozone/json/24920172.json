The ventilation system was operated either continuously, intermittently, or shut down during nights while it was on during workdays. It appears that the nighttime ventilation scheme is not important for indoor particle concentrations the following day if fans are operated to give five air exchanges in advance of the workday. The highest concentrations of PM10 were found during and after workdays and were due to human activity in the classroom. The average workday PM10 concentration was 14\u00a0\u03bcg/m(3) , well below the WHO guideline values. The number concentration of particles with diameter <0.750\u00a0\u03bcm was typically between 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(3) and 3.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(3) \u00a0particle/cm(3) . These concentrations were largely independent of the occupants. Transient formation of small particles was observed when ventilation was shut down. Then remaining ozone reacted with terpenes emitted by indoor sources and gave up to 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(3) \u00a0particle/cm(3) before formation stopped due to lack of ozone. The intermittent ventilation regime was found least favorable for the indoor air quality in the classroom."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
