In fact, following dental caries and periodontal disease, halitosis is the third most prevalent reason for patients going to the dentist. Due to multifactorial etiology, the diagnosis of halitosis requires a rigorous health/dental/social history, a clinical examination, and measurements. The treatment ranges from the use of dentifrices, mouthwashes, tongue scraping, and masking products, and more recently includes photodynamic therapy, probiotics, and ozone. The purpose of this narrative review was to examine the published literature concerning halitosis over the past 30 years and discuss the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Adjunct Clinical Professor and Director of Clinical Research, Ashman Department of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, New York; Private Practice, New York, New York."}], "LastName": "Froum", "ForeName": "Stuart J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Assistant Professor, Ashman Department of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, New York."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fellow at Advanced Program for International Dentists in Implant Dentistry, Ashman Department of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, New York; Diplomate, International Congress of Oral Implantologists."}], "LastName": "Reis", "ForeName": "Natacha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fellow at Advanced Program for International Dentists in Implant Dentistry, Ashman Department of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, New York; Diplomate, International Congress of Oral Implantologists."}], "LastName": "Asvaplungprohm", "ForeName": "Tanatorn", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Compend Contin Educ Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "9600713", "ISSNLinking": "1548-8578"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mouthwashes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Halitosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Mouthwashes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "24"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35523316"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
