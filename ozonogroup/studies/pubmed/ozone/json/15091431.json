Minaret) was exposed to three CO(2) levels, in combination with two nitrogen fertilizer levels and two levels of tropospheric ozone, from sowing to ripening in open-top chambers. Three additional nitrogen fertilizer treatments were carried out at the lowest and the highest CO(2) level, respectively. Plants were harvested at growth stages 31, 65 and 93 and separated into up to eight fractions to gain information about biomass partitioning. CO(2) enrichment (263 microl litre(-1) above ambient levels) drastically increased biomass of organs serving as long-term carbohydrate pools. Peduncle weight increased by 92%, stem weight by 73% and flag leaf sheath weight by 59% at growth stage 65. Average increase in shoot biomass due to CO(2) enrichment amounted to 51% at growth stage 65 and 36% at final harvest. Average yield increase was 34%. Elevated nitrogen application was most effective on biomass of green tissues. Yield was increased by 30% when nitrogen application was increased from 150 to 270 kg N ha(-1). Significant interactions were observed between CO(2) enrichment and nitrogen application. Yield increase due to CO(2) ranged from 23% at 120 kg N to 47% at 330 kg N. Triticum aestivum cv. Minaret was not very responsive to ozone at 1.5 times ambient levels. 1000 grain weight was slightly decreased, which was compensated by an increased number of grains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pflanzen\u00f6kologie, Heinrich-Buff-Ring 38, D-35392 Giessen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fangmeier", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gr\u00fcters", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hertstein", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandhage-Hofmann", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vermehren", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00e4ger", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15091431", "10.1016/0269-7491(95)00042-9", "0269749195000429"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
