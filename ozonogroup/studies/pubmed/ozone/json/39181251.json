The study considered the response of Artur Nick, a modern wheat cultivar commonly used in the area, to three O<sub>3</sub> exposure levels (ambient and elevated ambient, +20 and +40\u00a0nL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub>), and two N fertilization doses (100 and 200\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>). Measurements included leaf gas exchange, leaf chlorophyll content, leaf and grain N content, plant growth and yield parameters. Ozone\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0N interactive effects were studied and quantified based on accumulated O<sub>3</sub> concentrations above a 40\u00a0nL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> threshold (AOT40) and phytotoxic O<sub>3</sub> dose (POD) indices, which are used in O<sub>3</sub>-risk assessments, from which critical levels (CL) for a 5\u00a0% effect were derived. Results revealed that O<sub>3</sub> impacts on growth and yield parameters were stronger under the highest N fertilization dose. In consequence, O<sub>3</sub> Critical Levels (CL) were as much as 3-4 times lower for grain yield in the high-N compared to the low-N treatment. Interestingly, O<sub>3</sub> limited the fertilizer stimulus, strongly reducing the N use efficiency for grain yield and the agronomic efficiency of N for protein yield. Another important aspect was that 71\u00a0% of the POD was accumulated before anthesis, stressing the potential importance of O<sub>3</sub> exposure during the vegetative phase of wheat under Mediterranean conditions, which is usually considered less important than post-anthesis exposure. In conclusion, this study suggests the need to consider crop N management in the derivation of O<sub>3</sub> CLs, due to its effect on dose-response relationships used for CL derivation, including the potential O<sub>3</sub> effects in N use efficiency. Therefore, N modulation could be considered in the O<sub>3</sub>-risk assessment methodology to be applied in risk exercises when negotiating air pollution abatement policies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
