A recombinant yeast assay (YES assay) was employed to determine estrogenic activity of the ozonized samples and of the by-products formed during the ozonation. Ozonation was very efficient for the removal of 17beta-estradiol in aqueous solutions. High removals (>99%) were achieved with low ozone dosages in the three different pHs. Several by-products were formed during the ozonation of 17beta-estradiol. However, only a few compounds could be identified and confirmed. Different by-products are formed at different pHs, which is probably due to different chemical pathways and different oxidants (O(3) and OH radical). The by-products formed at pH 11 were 10epsilon-17beta-dihydroxy-1, 4-estradieno-3-one (DEO) and 2-hydroxyestradiol, which were not formed in pH 3. Only testosterone could be observed in pH 3, whereas at pH 7 all three by-products were found. At pH 7 and 11 the applied ozone dosages were not enough to remove all the estrogenicity from samples, even though the 17beta-estradiol residual concentration for these two pHs was lower than at pH 3. Higher estrogenicity was detected at pH 11. An explanation to this fact may be that oxidation via OH radical forms more by-products with estrogenic activity. Probably, the formation of 2-hydroxyestradiol at pHs 7 and 11 is contributing to the residual estrogenicity of samples ozonized at these pHs. In this work, complete removal of estrogenic activity was only obtained at pH 3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Engineering Program-COPPE, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, P.O.
