This practice extends the lifespan of rubber products, including tires, by preventing cracking, aging, and deterioration. However, the environmental consequences of waste generated during rubber product use, particularly the formation of 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q) through the reaction of 6PPD with ozone, have raised significant concerns due to their detrimental effects on ecosystems. Extensive research has revealed the widespread occurrence of 6PPD and its derivate 6PPD-Q in various environmental compartments, including air, water, and soil. The emerging substance of 6PPD-Q has been shown to pose acute mortality and long-term hazards to aquatic and terrestrial organisms at concentrations below environmentally relevant levels. Studies have demonstrated toxic effects of 6PPD-Q on a range of organisms, including zebrafish, nematodes, and mammals. These effects include neurobehavioral changes, reproductive dysfunction, and digestive damage through various exposure pathways. Mechanistic insights suggest that mitochondrial stress, DNA adduct formation, and disruption of lipid metabolism contribute to the toxicity induced by 6PPD-Q. Recent findings of 6PPD-Q in human samples, such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, underscore the importance of further research on the public health and toxicological implications of these compounds. The distribution, fate, biological effects, and underlying mechanisms of 6PPD-Q in the environment highlight the urgent need for additional research to understand and address the environmental and health impacts of these compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
