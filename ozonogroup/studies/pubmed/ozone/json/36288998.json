The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between air pollution and dementia.", "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched and updated in August 2021. Population-based cohort studies that reported on hazard ratio (HR) of dementia in association with exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in those aged >40 years were included. Data were extracted by 2 independent investigators. The main outcome was the pooled HR for dementia per increment of pollutant, calculated using a random-effects model. Results were reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020219036).", "A total of 20 studies were included in the systematic review, and 17 provided data for the meta-analysis. The total included population was 91,391,296, with 5,521,111 (6%) being diagnosed with dementia. A total of 12, 5, 6, and 4 studies were included in the meta-analyses of PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub>, NO<sub>X</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The risk of dementia increased by 3% per 1 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increment in PM<sub>2\u00b75</sub> (HR, 1.03; 95% CI [1.02-1.05]; I<sup>2</sup> = 100%).
