Several levels of modeling are addressed: word models, graphic models, mathematical models, and computer simulation implementation. Special attention is given to evaluating: (1) how the interaction between ozone exposure and vegetation effects is quantified, (2) the status of field testing of the model, and (3) the adequacy of information for enabling other investigators to replicate the model for further testing. Original contributions, not previously published, are made in this evaluation in the form of: (1) graphic model flow charts for published models, (2) clarification of mathematical equations for existing models, (3) graphic forms of functional relations comprising portions of models, and (4) graphic displays of model output performance versus observed data. The models that are evaluated cover acute exposure-response models, statistical and mechanistic-process models, including a partial model of ambient exposure versus ozone flux, and uptake. They also cover chronic exposure statistical approaches, including time-series modeling, mechanistic-process models, 'disintegrated' models of forest system simulations, chronic flux density-uptake-response, and models for regional effects assessment in forests and agricultural lands."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4151 N.W.
