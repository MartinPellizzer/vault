During twin jet deposition, multiple novel product species were observed along with several stable \"late\" products. Following annealing of these matrices to 35 K, absorptions due to two novel product species increased in intensity. In addition, new bands appeared, indicating the formation of an additional product. Subsequent UV irradiation destroyed several of the initial products and produced a new photoproduct. On the basis of (18)O and (16,18)O spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations, the novel intermediates H(3)COCdCH(3), H(3)CCdCH(2)OH, H(3)COCdOOCH(3), and H(3)CCdCHO were identified. Merged jet deposition led to a number of stable \"late\" products, including H(2)CO, CH(3)OH, and C(2)H(6), identifications that were confirmed by (18)O substitution. Mechanistic inferences for this reaction are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnati, P.O.
