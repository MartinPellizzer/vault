Daily average concentrations of ambient particulate matter with diameters \u22641 \u03bcm/2.5 \u03bcm/10\u00a0\u03bcm (PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were developed at a spatial resolution of 0.01\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.01\u00b0, and assigned to the residential addresses. Three exposure windows were considered, i.e., the process from primary to small antral follicle stage (W1), from primary to secondary follicle stage (W2), and from secondary to small antral follicle stage (W3). The air pollution-AMH association was fitted using the multivariable linear mixed effect model with adjustment for potential confounders. Stratified analyses were performed by age group, overweight status, residential region, and educational level.", "The level of AMH changed by -8.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): -12.1%, -5.3%), -2.1% (95% CI: -3.5%, -0.6%), -1.9% (95% CI: -3.3%, -0.5%), and -4.5% (95% CI: -7.1%, -1.9%) per 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, during W1. The effect estimates were significant during W2 for PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> while minimal association was observed in W3. Greater vulnerability for certain air pollutants were observed for women who lived in inland areas and were less educated.", "We found that ovarian reserve was negatively associated with air pollution exposure for women, particularly from the primary to secondary follicle stage.
