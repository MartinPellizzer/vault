Results showed that in the absence of ammonia, CO2 was capable of reducing bromate 38.0%-65.4% with one-unit pH depression. CO2 caused a slightly lower bromate reduction (4.2%) than did H2SO4 when the pH was depressed to 7.4, and a more a pronounced lower reduction (8.8%) when the pH was depressed to 6.9. In the presence of 0.20 mg/L-N ammonia, bromate was largely inhibited with 73.9% reduction. When the pH was depressed to 7.4, CO2 and H2SO4 showed an 11.3% and 23.5% bromate reduction respectively, demonstrating that the joint use of CO2 and ammonia might be a plausible strategy of blocking all three bromate formation pathways. CO2 could be applied through the aeration diffuser together with ozone gas, resulting in a similar bromate reduction compared with the premixing method through Venturi mixer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China. liji98@tsinghua.org.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lulu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Jialin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci (China)", "NlmUniqueID": "100967627", "ISSNLinking": "1001-0742"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22432285", "10.1016/s1001-0742(10)60544-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
