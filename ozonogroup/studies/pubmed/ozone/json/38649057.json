Atmospheric ethanol median concentrations in S\u00e3o Paulo (SP) (12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.1 ppbv) and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (RP) (12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.9 ppbv) were remarkably close, despite the SP vehicular fleet being \u223c13 times larger. Likewise, the rainwater VWM ethanol concentration in SP (4.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) was only 26\u00a0% higher than in RP (3.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>). This work demonstrated the importance of evaporative emissions, together with biomass burning, as sources of the compounds studied. The importance of biogenic emissions of methanol during forest flooding was identified in campaigns in the Amazon and Atlantic forests. Marine air masses arriving at a coastal site led to the lowest concentrations of ethanol measured in this work. Besides vehicular and biomass burning emissions, secondary formation of acetaldehyde by photochemical reactions may be relevant in urban and non-urban regions. The combined deposition flux of ethanol and methanol was 6.2\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup>, avoiding oxidation to the corresponding and more toxic aldehydes. Considering the species determined here, the ozone formation potential (OFP) in RP was around two-fold higher than in SP, further evidencing the importance of emissions from regional distilleries and biomass burning, in addition to vehicles. At the forest and coastal sites, the OFP was approximately 5 times lower than at the urban sites. Our work evidenced that transition from gasoline to ethanol or ethanol blends brings the associated risk of increasing the concentrations of highly toxic aldehydes and ozone, potentially impacting the atmosphere and threatening air quality and human health in urban areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
