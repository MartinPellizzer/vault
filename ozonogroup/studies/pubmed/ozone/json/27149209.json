This study measured ozone emissions and impacts on indoor ozone levels and associated exposures from 17 consumer products and home appliances that could emit ozone either intentionally or as a by-product of their functions. Nine products were found to emit measurable ozone, one up to 6230\u00a0ppb at a distance of 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0inches). One use of these products increased room ozone concentrations by levels up to 106\u00a0ppb (mean, from an ozone laundry system) and personal exposure concentrations of the user by 12-424\u00a0ppb (mean). Multiple cycles of use of one fruit and vegetable washer increased personal exposure concentrations by an average of 2550\u00a0ppb, over 28 times higher than the level of the 1-h California Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone (0.09\u00a0ppm). Ozone emission rates ranged from 1.6\u00a0mg/h for a refrigerator air purifier to 15.4\u00a0mg/h for a fruit and vegetable washer. The use of some products was estimated to contribute up to 87% of total daily exposures to ozone. The results show that the use of some products may result in potential health impacts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 The Authors.
