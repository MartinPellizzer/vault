Many studies have illustrated the associations between ambient air pollution exposure during gestational periods and PTB risks, but most of them only focused on one single air pollutant, such as PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In this population-based environmental-epidemiology study, we recruited 6275 pregnant mothers in Zhejiang Province, China, and evaluated their gestational exposures to various air pollutants during 2013-2017. Time-to-event logistic regressions were performed to estimate risk associations after adjusting all confounders, and Quasi-AQI model and PCA-GLM analysis were applied to resolve the collinearity issues in multi-pollutant regression models. It was found that gestational exposure to ambient air pollutants was significantly associated with the occurrence of PTB, and SO<sub>2</sub> was the largest contributor with a proportion of 29.4%. Three new variables, prime factor (a combination of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon factor (CO), and ozone factor (O<sub>3</sub>), were generated by PCA integration, contributing 63.4%, 17.1%, and 19.5% to PTB risks, respectively. The first and third trimester was the most crucial exposure window, suggesting the pregnant mothers better to avoid severe air pollution exposures during these sensitive periods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
