In this work, coumarin (COU) decomposition by O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>/SPC was proposed in terms of diverse parameters, including ozone concentration, SPC dosage and pH, with regard to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. About 96.5% of 25\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> COU was removed by 209.3\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> SPC and 2.08\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> within 30\u202fmin, whereas 49.8% of COU was exhausted in O<sub>3</sub> system alone. High ozone concentration and pH could enhance COU removal, and overdose SPC has an inhibition effect as CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> could react with \u00b7OH. Furtherly, the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) via a chain reaction in O<sub>3</sub> was ascertained based on indirect alcohols quenching tests and direct electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping tests, though high initial SPC concentration led to no trapping of OH by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) in O<sub>3</sub>/SPC. According to the concentration of dissolved ozone and prior study, a fast reaction kinetic model was estimated firstly for O<sub>3</sub>/SPC system and well fitted with different condition. The hydroxylated intermediates of 7-hydroxylcoumarin and 6,7-hydroxylcoumarin were recognized and the degradation pathways were proposed. The findings of the study can broaden the research direction of SPC and provide a new application information for SPC in environmental pollution control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
