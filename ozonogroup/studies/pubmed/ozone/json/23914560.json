In order to evaluate secondary aerosol formation at different ozone levels, CO was used as a tracer for primary aerosol, and 0(3, max) was used as an index for photochemical activity. Results show that along with increasing of O3 concentration, the concentration of primary and secondary aerosol was increased respectively from 0. 036 to 0.044 mg x m(-3) and from 0.018 to 0.055 mg x m(-3). The ratio of secondary to primary aerosol was increased from 49.8% to 124.5%. Furthermore, along with the increase of O(3, max) the forming time of O(3,max) and secondary aerosol was changed respectively from 13:00 to 14:00 and from 11:00-20:00 to 09:00-20:00. At the same time, the chemical composition of PM2.5 was different at different photochemical levels. PM(2.5) was composed of 12.0% organic carbon (OC), 18.7% sulfate (SO4(2-1)), 13.1% nitrate (NO3-) and 4.5% element carbon (EC) when O(3, max) was < 0.10 mg x m(-3) and PM2.5 was composed of 20.0% organic carbon (OC), 22.9% sulfate, 23.1% nitrate and 4.7% element carbon (EC) with O(3, max) > 0. 20 mg x m(-3). These results approved that the photochemical reactivity promoted the production of SO4(2-), NO3- and OC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200030, China. cuihx@semc.gov.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Hu-xiong", "Initials": "HX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ya-ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Yu-sen", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Qing-yan", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi-hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong-fang", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemical Processes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23914560"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
