For the first goal, the data of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, measured at 21 regulatory monitoring network stations in Tehran, were obtained and the temporal trends were investigated. The health impact assessment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> was performed using the World Health Organization (WHO) AirQ+ software updated in 2016 by WHO European Centre for Environment and Health. Local baseline incidences in Tehran level were used to better reveal the health effects associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Our study showed that over 2006-2015, annual mean concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> varied from 24.7 to 38.8\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup> and 35.4 to 76.0\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, and were significantly declining in the recent 6\u202fyears (2010-2015) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and 8\u202fyears (2008-2015) for O<sub>3</sub>. However, Tehran citizens were exposed to concentrations of annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> exceeding the WHO air quality guideline (WHO AQG) (10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup>), U.S. EPA and Iranian standard levels (12\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm<sup>-3</sup>) during entire study period. We estimated that long-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> contributed to between 24.5% and 36.2% of mortality from cerebrovascular disease (stroke), 19.8% and 24.1% from ischemic heart disease (IHD), 13.6% and 19.2% from lung cancer (LC), 10.7% and 15.3% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 15.0% and 25.2% from acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), and 7.6% and 11.3% from all-cause annual mortality in the time period. We further estimated that deaths from IHD accounted for most of mortality attributable to long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The years of life lost (YLL) attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub> was estimated to vary from 67,970 to 106,706 during the study period. In addition, long-term exposure to O<sub>3</sub> was estimated to be responsible for 0.9% to 2.3% of mortality from respiratory diseases. Overall, long-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> contributed substantially to mortality in Tehran megacity. Air pollution is a modifiable risk factor.
