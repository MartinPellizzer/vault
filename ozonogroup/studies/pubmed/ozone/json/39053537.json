However, the interactions among different sources and natural intervention in modulating anthropogenic management have not been comprehensively assessed. Here, the WRF-CMAQ-MEGAN modeling system was utilized to simulate an O<sub>3</sub> episode over PRD. The integrated source apportionment method (ISAM) and brute-force top-down combined with factor separation approach (BF-TD-FSA) were applied to quantify source contributions, impacts of individual or multiple sources on O<sub>3</sub>, and decouple interactions among various emissions; additionally, based on ISAM, O<sub>3</sub> isopleths visualized MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> response of different source types to anthropogenic perturbations. ISAM concluded considerable MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> contributions of regional transport in PRD/NPRD (non-PRD areas in Guangdong province) (38.8\u00a0%/35.7\u00a0%), followed by anthropogenic (32.7\u00a0%/24.8\u00a0%), BVOC (biogenic volatile organic compounds, 23.8\u00a0%/20.3\u00a0%) and SNO (soil NO, \u223c4\u00a0%) emissions. Compared to concentrated anthropogenic contributions, widespread natural contributions were observed across their source areas and along the transport pathways. The BF-TD also revealed that regional transport had the largest impact (>90\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>) on MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> while anthropogenic and BVOC emissions greatly affected downwind PRD (64.5 and 7.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup>). Negative synergy between anthropogenic and natural emissions (especially BVOC emission) suggested potential natural-induced intensification of anthropogenic impact during O<sub>3</sub> management. The MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> isopleths further demonstrated significant BVOC-induced reward and regional transport-induced penalty for anthropogenic NO<sub>x</sub> (ANO<sub>x</sub>) emission control benefits, leading to additional maximum MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> decrease and increase by -27.5 and 13.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m<sup>-3</sup> in polluted high-emission grids. The natural-induced reward effect could impose loose requirements on anthropogenic reduction (decreased by 13.3\u00a0%-17.7\u00a0%) if there were no regional transport-induced control penalty. It is advisable to prioritize ANO<sub>x</sub> control and seek collaboration on air quality management with neighboring provinces to maximize the natural-induced control reward and achieve desired targets with minimal human efforts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
