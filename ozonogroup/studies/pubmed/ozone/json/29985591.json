We performed a longitudinal panel study with four repeated measurements among 43 young adults in Shanghai, China from May to October in 2016. We collected buccal samples and measured the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) after 3-day personal ozone monitoring. In buccal samples, we measured concentrations of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (ARG), and DNA methylation of NOS2A and ARG2. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze the effects of ozone on FeNO, two enzymes and their DNA methylation. A 10 ppb increase in ozone (lag 0-8 h) was significantly associated with a 3.89% increase in FeNO, a 36.33% increase in iNOS, and a decrease of 0.36 in the average methylation (%5mC) of NOS2A. Ozone was associated with decreased ARG and elevated ARG2 methylation, but the associations were not significant. These effects were more pronounced among allergic subjects than healthy subjects. The effects were much stronger when using personal exposure monitoring than fixed-site measurements. Our study demonstrated that personal short-term exposure to ozone may result in acute respiratory inflammation, which may be mainly modulated by NOS2A hypomethylation in the arginase-nitric oxide synthase pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and NHC Key
