NOx and SO2 seemed to become moderate in recent years, and the concentrations during the whole observations ranged from 0.49 to 9.57\u00a0ppb and from 0.10 to 16.02\u00a0ppb, respectively. The high concentrations of CO were measured with an average value of 0.98\u00a0ppm. The measured O3 average concentration was 76.25\u00a0ppb, which showed a higher level comparing with the results from some previous studies. Most of the results for the concentration values generally followed the typical characteristic of vertical and spatial distribution, which were \"low altitude > high altitude\" and \"land/coastal > sea,\" respectively. Transport of polluted air mass from the continent to the aircraft measurement area was confirmed in some days during the observation by the meteorological analysis, while the measurement results supposed to represent the background level of the pollutants in rest days. Additionally, some small-scale air pollution plumes were observed. Significant positive correlations between NOx and SO2 indicated that these two species originated from the same region. On the other hand, good positive correlations between NOx and O3 found during 2-day flight suggested that the O3 formation was probably under \"NOx-limited\" regime in these days."]}, "AuthorList":
