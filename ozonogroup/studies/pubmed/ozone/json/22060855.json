For this, beef trimmings were inoculated with Escherichia coli (EC) and Salmonella typhimurium (ST) then treated with either (1) 1% ozonated water followed by 5% acetic acid (OA), (2) 1% ozonated water followed by 0.5% cetylpyridinium chloride (OC), (3) 200 ppm chlorine dioxide followed by 10% trisodium phosphate (CT) or (4) control (C). Trimmings were ground, packaged and sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 days of display for EC, ST, coliforms (CO), aerobic plate count (APC), instrumental color and sensory color and odor characteristics. The OA and OC treatments reduced (P<0.05) all bacterial types evaluated, while CT reduced (P<0.05) EC, CO and APC. The CT treatment was redder (P<0.05) in overall color than C, and there was no difference (P>0.05) in beef odor or off odor between OC, CT or C treatments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pohlman", "ForeName": "F W", "Initials": "FW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stivarius", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McElyea", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Z B", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Meat Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101160862", "ISSNLinking": "0309-1740"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22060855", "10.1016/s0309-1740(01)00198-x", "S0309-1740(01)00198-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
