Here, luminescence-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis was applied to monitor and treat cultured and naturally occurring cyanobacteria cells. When evaluating lab-cultured Microcystis aeruginosa, ATP concentrations (\u2264252,000\u202fpg/mL) had improved sensitivity and correlated well (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.969) with optical density measurements at 730\u202fnm (OD730; \u22640.297\u202fcm<sup>-1</sup>). Following one year of monitoring of a surface water supply, ATP concentrations (\u22642000\u202fpg/mL) correlated (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.791) with chlorophyll-a concentrations (\u226450\u202f\u03bcg/L). A preliminary early warning threshold of 175\u202fpg ATP/mL corresponded with 5\u202f\u03bcg/L chlorophyll-a to initiate increased monitoring (e.g., of cyanotoxins). Following oxidation processes (i.e., chlorine, chloramine, ozone, permanganate), ATP was demonstrated as an indicator of cell lysis and a threshold value of <100\u202fpg/mL was recommended for complete release of intracellular cyanotoxins. ATP was also used to assess efficacy of copper (Cu(II)) treatment on cyanobacteria-laden surface water. While 24-h exposure to 2.5\u202fmg Cu(II)/L did not impact chlorophyll-a, ATP decreased from 13,500 to 128\u202fpg/mL indicating metabolic activity was minimized. Ultimately, ATP analysis holds promise for early detection and mitigation of potentially harmful algal blooms based on superior sensitivity, independence from cell morphology artifacts, rapid time for analysis (<10\u202fmin), and ease of deployment in the field compared to conventional methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).
