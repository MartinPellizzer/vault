The results showed that under doubled CO2 concentration, the amount and volume of starch grains in chloroplast increased, but the chloroplast membrane and the lamellar structure still kept integrated. The accumulation of starch grains was restrained, and the chloroplast membrane and the lamellar structure were disorganized under doubled-O3 concentration. The ultrastructure of chloroplast was destroyed in different degrees under the interaction of doubled CO2 and O3 concentration. The damage to chloroplast arose from the abrupt doubling of CO2 and O3 was more severe than that from gradual increase of CO2 and O3 concentration. The negative effect of O3 was partly compensated by the positive effect of doubled CO2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Ecological Process, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China. zth1999@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Tianhong", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Guohong", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15031922"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
