In this study, 10-year variations of six major air pollutants were analyzed at seven monitoring sites in Hong Kong. The continuous decrease of annual averaged concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> and numbers of days with severe pollution conditions validated the efficiency of the series of air pollution control schemes implemented by the Hong Kong government. However, there is still a big gap to meet the ultimate targets described by the World Health Organization. Besides, the concentration of O<sub>3</sub> at roadside and urban stations increased by 135% \u00b1 25% and 37% \u00b1 18% from 2011 to 2020, respectively, meanwhile the highest 8\u00a0hr averaged O<sub>3</sub> concentration was observed as 294 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup> at background station in 2020, which pointed out the increasing ozone pollution in Hong Kong. There was a great decrease in the annual times of air quality health index (AQHI) laying in \"high\", \"very high\" and \"serious\" categories from 2011 to 2020 with the decrease rate of 89.70%, 91.30% and 89.74% at roadside stations, and 79.03%, 95.98% and 72.73% at urban stations, respectively. Nevertheless, the number of days categorized as \"high\" or above at roadside station was twice more than that in the urban station during the past ten years. Thus, more policies and attentions should be given to the roadside air quality and its adverse health effect to pedestrians on street."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
