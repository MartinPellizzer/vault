We built linear regression and random forest regression models using 4-years (2015-2018; hourly-averaged) observations for forecasting O<sub>3</sub>, NO and NO<sub>2</sub> levels for two scenarios (1-month prediction (for January 2019) and 1-year prediction (for 2019)) - with and without the impact of meteorology. These flexible models have been developed for, both, localised (site-specific models) and combined (indicative of city-level) cases. Both models were aided with machine learning, to reduce their time-intensity compared to models built over high-performance computing. O<sub>3</sub> prediction performance of linear regression model at the city level, under both cases of meteorological consideration, was found to be significantly poor. However, the site-specific model with meteorology performed satisfactorily (r\u00a0=\u00a00.87; RK Puram site). Further, during testing, linear regression models (site-specific and combined) for NO and NO<sub>2</sub> with meteorology, show a slight improvement in their prediction accuracies when compared to the corresponding equivalent linear models without meteorology. Random forest regression with meteorology performed satisfactorily for indicative city-level NO (r\u00a0=\u00a00.90), NO<sub>2</sub> (r\u00a0=\u00a00.89) and O<sub>3</sub> (r\u00a0=\u00a00.85). In both regression techniques, increased uncertainty in modelling O<sub>3</sub> is attributed to it being a secondary pollutant, non-linear dependency on NO<sub>x</sub>, VOCs, CO, radicals, and micro-climatic meteorological parameters. Analysis of importance among various precursors and meteorology have also been computed. The study holistically concludes that site-specific models with meteorology perform satisfactorily for both linear regression and random forest regression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
