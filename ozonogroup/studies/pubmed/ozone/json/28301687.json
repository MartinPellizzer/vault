A total number of 40 (40 women, with a mean age of 31\u00b77) were selected after the diagnosis of myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for temporomandibular disorder (RDC/TMD). The patients were randomly divided into two groups: patients received the ozone therapy at the point of greatest pain, ozone group (OG; n\u00a0=\u00a020); patients received the sham ozone therapy at the point of greatest pain, placebo group (PG; n\u00a0=\u00a020). Ozone and placebo were applied three times per week, for a total of six sessions. Mandibular movements were examined, masticator muscles tenderness were assessed and pressure pain threshold (PPT) values were obtained. Subjective pain levels were evaluated using visual analogue sale (VAS). These assessments were performed at baseline, 1\u00a0month and 3\u00a0months. Ozono therapy decreased pain intensity and increased PPT values significantly from baseline to 1\u00a0month and 3\u00a0months in OG compared with PG. PPTs of the temporal (OG\u00a0=\u00a024\u00b785\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00b765, PG\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b765\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00b743, P\u00a0=\u00a00.035) and masseter (OG\u00a0=\u00a019\u00b703\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00b742, PG\u00a0= 14\u00b723\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00b795, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) muscles at 3\u00a0months of control (T2) were significantly higher in the OG group. PPT value of the lateral pole was also significantly higher at T2 in the OG group (OG\u00a0=\u00a021\u00b725\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00b743, PG\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b735\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00b718, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Mandibular movements did not show significant differences between treatment groups except right\u00a0lateral excursion values at T2 (OG\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b790\u00a0\u00b1 1\u00b777, PG\u00a0=\u00a06\u00b785\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b741, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003); however, OG demonstrated significantly better results over time. Overall improvements in VAS scores from baseline to 3\u00a0months were OG 67\u00b77%; PG 48\u00b74%. Although ozone therapy can be accepted as an alternative treatment modality in the management of masticatory muscle pain, sham ozone therapy (placebo) showed significant improvements in the tested parameters."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8085-6356"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Celakil", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Muric", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Gokcen Roehlig", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Evlioglu", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Keskin", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Rehabil", "NlmUniqueID": "0433604", "ISSNLinking": "0305-182X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Myofascial Pain Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Threshold"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28301687", "10.1111/joor.12506"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
