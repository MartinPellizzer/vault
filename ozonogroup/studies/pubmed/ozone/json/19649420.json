An ecological study was performed, using live birth data from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. The environmental data were obtained from the S\u00e3o Paul State Environmental Agency. The study included full-term newborns whose mothers were 20 to 34 years of age and had at least a complete high school education, seven or more prenatal visits, singleton pregnancy, and vaginal delivery, in order to minimize potential confounding from these variables. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of each pollutant. Low birth weight was defined as less than 2,500 g. The sample included a total of 2,529 data from 2001 that met the inclusion criteria (25.6% of the total). We identified 99 newborns (3.95% of the sample) with low birth weight, and the pollutants sulfur dioxide and ozone were associated with low birth weight. The final model was A(x) = -1.79 + 1.30 (SO2) + 1.26 (O3). Thus, sulfur dioxide and ozone were identified as risk factors for low birth weight in a medium-sized city in Southeast Brazil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Medicina, Universidade de Taubat\u00e9, Taubat\u00e9, Brasil. lfcn@unitau.br"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nascimento", "ForeName": "Luiz Fernando C", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Douglas A", "Initials": "DA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Cad Saude Publica", "NlmUniqueID": "8901573", "ISSNLinking": "0102-311X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0UZA3422Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Low Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urban Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19649420", "10.1590/s0102-311x2009000800015", "S0102-311X2009000800015"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
