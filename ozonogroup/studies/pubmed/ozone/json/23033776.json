Patients were divided into two groups. Comparison group included 60 patients who received conventional combined therapy, main group - 43 patients, who, along with the standard complex treatment measures, were used local and systemic intravenous ozone therapy (OT). The severity state of patients evaluated by Mannheim peritoneal index (MPI). To assess the immune status in blood of the patients with GP were studied the level of lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD11a+, CD19+), the phagocytic activity of neutrophilic granulocytes, concentration of immunoglobulin A, M, G, and the content of circulating immune complexes (CIC). Studies have shown that GP is accompanied by changes in the functioning of the immune system, the severity and extent of which depends on the severity of MPI. The conventional basic therapy is not effective in correcting of these disturbances. Using the local and systemic OT in the complex of therapeutic measures in individually selected patients with GP have a positive effect on some level of immunity with a tendency to restore the immune system dysfunction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gadzhiev", "ForeName": "N D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sushkov", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Klimova", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lavinskaia", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ukraine", "MedlineTA": "Klin Khir", "NlmUniqueID": "9516872", "ISSNLinking": "0023-2130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infusions, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Peritonitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23033776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
