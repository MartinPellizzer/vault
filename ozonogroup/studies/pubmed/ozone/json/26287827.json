The prepared catalysts of Mn-Ce/HZSM-5 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that Mn-Ce/HZSM-5 exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity for the degradation of BPA. Removal of 89.3% of BPA and 90.4% of total organic carbon (TOC) was achieved in 30 min, compared to non-catalytic ozonation, where only 50.5% BPA and 28.1% TOC removal were reached under the same conditions. Adsorption of BPA on HZSM-5 support and Mn-Ce/HZSM-5 catalysts was negligible. The strong inhibition of BPA removal by tert-butyl alcohol indicated that the attack of hydroxyl radicals was responsible for the improvement of catalytic ozonation. It was observed that at neutral pH, which is near the point of zero charge of the catalyst, the catalytic activity reached its maximum. Increasing the amount of Mn-Ce/HZSM-5 catalyst until it exceeded 3 g/L did not show a strong effect on BPA removal. The catalysts showed high stability and reusability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, 70 Yuhua East Road, Shijiazhuang 050018, China E-mail: lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yanfang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, 70 Yuhua East Road, Shijiazhuang 050018, China E-mail: lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Junna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, 70 Yuhua East Road, Shijiazhuang 050018, China E-mail: lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zaixing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, 70 Yuhua East Road, Shijiazhuang 050018, China E-mail: lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guixia", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, 70 Yuhua East Road, Shijiazhuang 050018, China E-mail: lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, 70 Yuhua East Road, Shijiazhuang 050018, China E-mail: lyftry@126.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9879497", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1318-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeolites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30K4522N6T", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42Z2K6ZL8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Manganese"}, {"RegistryNumber": "619G5K328Y", "NameOfSubstance": "ceric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MLT3645I99", "NameOfSubstance": "bisphenol A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cerium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manganese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zeolites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26287827", "10.2166/wst.2015.258"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
