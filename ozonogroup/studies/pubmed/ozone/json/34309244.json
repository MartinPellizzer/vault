However, frequent O<sub>3</sub> pollution events have highlighted the urgent need to explore the occurrence patterns of O<sub>3</sub> pollution and develop scientific strategies for reducing O<sub>3</sub> peaks. This study examines data from July 2017, when the cumulative number of O<sub>3</sub> pollution days in 17 cities in the Yangtze River Delta was 165 days, of which Shanghai was the most serious, with an exceedance rate of 64.5%. During this period, the average concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> in Shanghai was 27.1 \u03bcg\u00b7m<sup>-3</sup> and volatile organic copunds (VOCs) mixing ratio was 22.5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>. By analyzing ozone precursor concentrations and meteorological factors, we determined that these events mainly resulted from a combination of unfavorable meteorological conditions such as high temperature, low humidity, low wind speed, and high precursor emissions. WRF-CMAQ scenario simulations showed that a reduction in precursor emissions in Shanghai alone would have a limited controlling effect on regional O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Thus, regional joint control is recommended when widespread pollution events occur. Our analysis shows that if VOCs in Shanghai and nine neighboring cities can be reduced by 30%, the maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Shanghai could be reduced by 7.2%. If the reduction number of these cities rises to 17, the maximum 8-h O<sub>3</sub> concentration reduction rate in Shanghai will increase to 7.8%. It is also recommended that the VOCs:NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> reduction ratio should be strictly controlled at more than 3:1, or else the O<sub>3</sub> concentration in some areas will increase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ru-Sha", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of the Urban Air Complex, Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Jing-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34309244", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202011243"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
