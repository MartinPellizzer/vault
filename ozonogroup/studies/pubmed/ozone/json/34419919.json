In addition to the typical odor problems caused by algae or microorganisms, the occurrence of odors derived from drinking water disinfection have attracted attention. The chlor(am)ination-derived odor substances have certain toxicity and odor-causing characteristics, and would enter the tap water through water distribution systems, directly affecting drinking water safety and customer experience. This study provided a comprehensive overview of the occurrence, detection, and control of odor substances derived from drinking water chlor(am)ination disinfection. The occurrence and formation mechanisms of several typical types of disinfection derived odor substances were summarized, including haloanisoles, N-chloroaldimines, iodotrihalomethanes, and halophenoles. They are mainly derived from specific precursors such as halophenols, anisoles, and amino acids species during the disinfection or distribution networks. In addition, the change of disinfectant during chlor(am)ination was also one of the causes of disinfection odors. Due to the extremely low odor threshold concentrations (OTCs) of these odor substances, the effective sample pre-enrichment for instrument identification and quantification are essential. The control strategies of odor problems mainly include adsorption, chemical oxidation, and combined processes such as ozonation and biological activated carbon processes (O<sub>3</sub>/BAC) and ultraviolet-based advanced oxidation processes (UV-AOPs). Finally, the challenges and possible future research directions in this research field were discussed and proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
