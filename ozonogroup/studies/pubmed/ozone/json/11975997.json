Ketones, such as acetone, are often found in groundwaters and wastewaters at levels too low for supporting a bioreactor, yet since acetone is so soluble, it does not adsorb onto activated carbon very well, nor does it volatilize from water influent using air stripping. This study was undertaken to evaluate three advanced oxidation processes for their comparative ability to remove acetone from aqueous media. Optimization of the oxidation processes was attempted via adjustments of oxidizer inputs. The results indicated that all of the AOPs tested showed promise for removing acetone from water; however, ozonated systems undergoing UV photolysis achieved the highest rate and extent of treatment observed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dave C.
