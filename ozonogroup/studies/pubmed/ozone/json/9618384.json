During the regeneration process, apoptotic mechanisms may be responsible for eliminating metaplastic cells. Therefore, the present study investigated expression of Bcl-2, a regulator of apoptosis, in ozone-induced mucous cell metaplasias. Adjacent metaplastic mucous cells in nasal airway epithelia that were exposed to ozone were heterogeneous in their expression of Bcl-2; some cells expressed high levels, whereas others expressed low levels or no Bcl-2. On Western blot analysis, Bcl-2 was detected in protein extracts from nasal epithelia of rats exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone for 1 mo but not in control rats exposed to filtered air. The number of metaplastic mucous cells in transitional epithelia of rat nasal airways was increased from 0 to about 200 after 3 and 6 mo of exposure to ozone; only 0 to 10 metaplastic mucous cells remained after a recovery period of 13 wk in rats exposed to ozone for 3 mo. The number of mucous cells of the respiratory epithelium lining the midseptum did not change after ozone exposure or recovery. The percentage of Bcl-2-positive cells lining the midseptum increased from 7 to 14% after a 3- and 6-mo ozone exposure, respectively. In transitional epithelia of the lateral wall and the nasoturbinates and maxilloturbinates, 35 to 55% of cells were Bcl-2-positive after a 1-mo exposure and 10 to 18% after both a 3- and a 6-mo exposure to ozone. Bcl-2 reactivity decreased to 0 to 8% after a recovery period of 13 wk. These observations suggest that Bcl-2 plays a role in the development and resolution of mucous cell metaplasias. This model may be useful in uncovering the role of Bcl-2 during the development and maintenance of metaplastic mucous cells. Disregulation of Bcl-2 expression may be responsible for the sustained mucous cell metaplasia in asthmatics or may allow cells to accumulate and become more susceptible to transformation leading to neoplasia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tesfaigzi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hotchkiss", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harkema", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8917225", "ISSNLinking": "1044-1549"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metaplasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mucous Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9618384", "10.1165/ajrcmb.18.6.3036"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
