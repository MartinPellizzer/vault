Merr., vary in their foliar response to ozone. The physiological basis of this variation was investigated as a function of leaf age through an analysis of ozone flux data, leaf developmental morphology, and analogue modelling techniques. At all concentrations (0.25-0.58 \u03bcl l<sup>-1</sup>) and exposure times (1-4 h), resistance to O<sub>3</sub> flux in the gas phase of the diffusive pathway (i.e., boundary layer and stomate) did not account fully for variation in pollutant uptake rates into the leaf interior. Ozone molecules experienced a residual resistance to diffusion that is not shared by effluxing water vapor molecules. Residual resistance to O<sub>3</sub> flux increased with pollutant concentration and exposure time and was associated with age-dependent differences in foliar O<sub>3</sub> response. Leaf morphology data, including stomatal frequency and the ratio of internal to external surface area, did not help explain cultivar or age-dependent differences in O<sub>3</sub> flux. The extent of foliar injury was not consistently related to the magnitude of O<sub>3</sub> flux into the leaf interior. An analysis of the residual resistance to O<sub>3</sub> flux suggests that the gas and liquid phase pathways for O<sub>3</sub>, water vapor, and carbon dioxide are not identical."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 37830, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Corvallis Environmental Research Laboratory, 97330, Corvallis, Oregon, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tingey", "ForeName": "D T", "Initials": "DT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Corvallis Environmental Research Laboratory, 97330, Corvallis, Oregon, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ratsch", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Oecologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0150372", "ISSNLinking": "0029-8549"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Air Pollut Control Assoc. 1971 Jun;21(6):341-6", "ArticleIdList": ["5148259"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1975 Jun;55(6):1067-70", "ArticleIdList": ["16659211"]}, {"Citation": "Planta. 1971 Dec;97(4):325-36", "ArticleIdList": ["24493277"]}, {"Citation": "J Air Pollut Control Assoc. 1973 Nov;23(11):957-62", "ArticleIdList": ["4756882"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1981 Jan 9;211(4478):167-9", "ArticleIdList": ["17757268"]}, {"Citation": "Environ Res. 1973 Mar;6(1):91-4", "ArticleIdList": ["4745373"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28311107", "10.1007/BF00545661", "10.1007/BF00545661"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
