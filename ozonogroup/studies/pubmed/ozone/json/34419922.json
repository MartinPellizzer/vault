Treated SFCWW by ozonation and two solar processes (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/solar, Fe<sup>3+</sup>-EDDHA/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/solar) was used to irrigate two raw-eaten crops (lettuce and radish) grown in peat. Two foodborne pathogens (E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis) and five organic microcontaminants (OMCs: atrazine, azoxystrobin, buprofezin, procymidone and terbutryn) were monitored along the whole process. The three studied processes showed a high treatment capability (reaching microbial loads < 7 CFU/100 mL and 21-90 % of OMC reduction), robustness (based on 7 or 10 analysed batches for each treatment process) and high suitability for subsequent treated SFCWW safe reuse: non-phytotoxic towards Lactuca sativa and no bacterial regrowth during its storage for a week. The analysis of the harvested crop samples irrigated with treated SFCWW in all the studied processes showed an absence of microbial contamination (< limit of detection, LOD; i.e., < 1 CFU/99 g of lettuce and < 1 CFU/8 g of radish), a significant reduction of OMC uptake (in the range 40-60 % and > 90 % for solar treated and ozonated SFCWW, respectively) and bioaccumulation in both crops in comparison with the results obtained with untreated SFCWW. Moreover, the chlorophyll content in the harvested lettuces irrigated with SFCWW treated by Fe<sup>3+</sup>-EDDHA/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/solar was twice than that irrigated with SFCWW treated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/solar and ozone, indicating the additional advantage of using Fe<sup>3+</sup>-EDDHA as an iron source to reduce the risk of iron chlorosis in crops. Finally, the chemical (dietary risk assessment for the combined exposure of the 5 OMCs) and quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) of the harvested crops showed the capability of the studied processes to reduce the risk associated with untreated SFCWW reuse by more than 50 % and more than 4 orders of magnitude, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
