The role of deposition and halogen chemistry is examined through incorporation of an enhanced ozone deposition algorithm and inclusion of halogen chemistry in a comprehensive atmospheric modeling system. The enhanced ozone deposition treatment accounts for the interaction of iodide in seawater with ozone and increases deposition velocities by 1 order of magnitude. Halogen chemistry includes detailed chemical reactions of organic and inorganic bromine and iodine species. Two different simulations are completed with the halogen chemistry: without and with photochemical reactions of higher iodine oxides. Enhanced deposition reduces mean summer-time surface ozone by \u223c3% over marine regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Halogen chemistry without the photochemical reactions of higher iodine oxides reduces surface ozone by \u223c15% whereas simulations with the photochemical reactions of higher iodine oxides indicate ozone reductions of \u223c48%. The model without these processes overpredicts ozone compared to observations whereas the inclusion of these processes improves predictions. The inclusion of photochemical reactions for higher iodine oxides leads to ozone predictions that are lower than observations, underscoring the need for further refinement of the halogen emissions and chemistry scheme in the model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020National Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, United States."}], "LastName": "Sarwar", "ForeName": "Golam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020National Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, United States."}], "LastName": "Gantt", "ForeName": "Brett", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020National Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, United States."}], "LastName": "Schwede", "ForeName": "Donna", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020National Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, United States."}], "LastName": "Foley", "ForeName": "Kristen", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020National Exposure Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, United States."}], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Group, Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano, CSIC, Madrid 28006, Spain."}], "LastName": "Saiz-Lopez", "ForeName": "Alfonso", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "0213155", "ISSNLinking": "0013-936X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Halogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Halogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26151227", "10.1021/acs.est.5b01657"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
