Many lichen species are considered as extremophiles due to their tolerance to radiation, desiccation, temperature and pollution. However, not all lichen species are tolerant to harsh environmental conditions as several species are sensitive for example to nitrogen, sulphur, acidity, heavy metals, halogens (<i>e.g.</i> fluoride) and ozone. Thus, to better understand why some lichens can withstand exposure to pollutants as opposed to those that are susceptible, we focused on the lichen species of <i>Dirinaria</i> known for their wide distribution in the tropics, subtropics and pantropical, and moderate tolerance to air pollution. Their moderate tolerance to air pollution affords them to thrive in good air quality environments as well as polluted air environments. Lichen samples of <i>Dirinaria</i> sp., UKM-J1 and UKM-K1, were respectively collected from two areas with different levels of air quality based on Air Pollutant Index or API (with index pollutant criteria of PM<sub>10</sub>, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide) in the outskirt of Jerantut (UKM-J1), a rural area in the middle of Peninsular Malaysia and the township of Klang (UKM-K1), in a busy area of the Klang Valley, Malaysia. API was monitored throughout 2012-2013 whereby the sample collection site in Klang showed markedly higher concentrations of pollutants in all the index pollutant criteria as compared to that of Jerantut. We performed transcriptome sequencing using Illumina RNA-seq technology and <i>de novo</i> assembly of the transcripts from the lichen samples. Raw reads from both libraries were deposited in the NCBI database with the accession number SRP138994."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bharudin", "ForeName": "Izwan", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdul Rahim", "ForeName": "Siti NurhaniAbdul", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Malaysia Genome Institute, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Jalan Bangi, 43000 Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abu Bakar", "ForeName": "Mohd FaizalAbu", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Siti Norsaidah", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamaruddin", "ForeName": "Shazilah", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Latif", "ForeName": "Mohd Talib", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences & Food Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samsudin", "ForeName": "Mohd Wahid", "Initials": "MW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdul Murad", "ForeName": "Abdul Munir", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abu Bakar", "ForeName": "Farah DibaAbu", "Initials": "FD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Rahim S.N.
