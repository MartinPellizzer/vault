However, the accurate quantification of terpenoid emissions from biomass burning is currently lacking, leading to underestimated air quality impacts. This study developed a near real-time hourly open biomass burning (OBB) emission inventory named OBEIC, which incorporated geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite fire radiative power. The OBEIC inventory provided emission estimates of 69 terpenoids, categorized into four groups, at an hourly resolution. Monoterpenes were the dominant contributors to the total emissions, accounting for 58\u00a0% of the total terpenoid emissions from OBB. Notably, only 24\u00a0% of the total monoterpenes emitted from OBB were accounted for by \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-pinene, indicating the importance of quantifying emissions of other monoterpene species such as limonene and camphene. Additionally, oxygenated terpenoids, which were previously overlooked, contribute to 20\u00a0% of total terpenoid emissions from OBB. Diurnally, the emissions of terpenoids were primarily concentrated during the daytime (61\u00a0%); however, this study revealed the significance of nighttime emissions (39\u00a0%) as well. When compared to the biogenic and anthropogenic emissions, OBB made substantial contributions to nighttime isoprene (99.8\u00a0%), monoterpene (66.8\u00a0%), and sesquiterpene (61.7\u00a0%) emissions where OBB occurs (in 3\u00a0km range), suggesting its significant role in nighttime secondary pollutant formation. The methodology developed in this study has the potential to reduce uncertainties in OBB emissions estimation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
