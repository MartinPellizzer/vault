Their repeating structures offer a great degree of control over pore sizes, dimensions and surface properties. Similarly precise engineering at the nanoscale is difficult to achieve with discrete molecules, since they rarely crystallize as porous structures. Here we report a small organic molecule that organizes into a noncovalent organic framework with large empty pores. This structure is held together by a combination of [N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N] hydrogen bonds between the terminal pyrazole rings and [\u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0] stacking between the electron-rich pyrazoles and electron-poor tetrafluorobenzenes. Such a synergistic arrangement makes this structure stable to at least 250\u2009\u00b0C and porous, with an accessible surface area of 1,159\u2009m(2)\u2009g(-1). Crystals of this framework adsorb hydrocarbons, CFCs and fluorocarbons-the latter two being ozone-depleting substances and potent greenhouse species-with weight capacities of up to 75%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, 112 Fleming Building, Houston, Texas 77204-5003, USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Teng-Hao", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, 112 Fleming Building, Houston, Texas 77204-5003, USA."}], "LastName": "Popov", "ForeName": "Ilya", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, 112 Fleming Building, Houston, Texas 77204-5003, USA."}], "LastName": "Kaveevivitchai", "ForeName": "Watchareeya", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Hsinchu 30076, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chuang", "ForeName": "Yu-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Radiation Source (ChemMatCARS), The University of Chicago, c/o APS/ANL, 9700 South Cass Drive, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu-Sheng", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, 112 Fleming Building, Houston, Texas 77204-5003, USA."}], "LastName": "Daugulis", "ForeName": "Olafs", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1] Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, 112 Fleming Building, Houston, Texas 77204-5003, USA [2] Texas Center for Superconductivity, 202 UH Science Center, Houston, Texas 77204-5002, USA."}], "LastName": "Jacobson", "ForeName": "Allan J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, 112 Fleming Building, Houston, Texas 77204-5003, USA."}], "LastName": "Miljani\u0107", "ForeName": "Ognjen \u0160", "Initials": "O\u0160"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101528555", "ISSNLinking": "2041-1723"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25307413", "10.1038/ncomms6131", "ncomms6131"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
