In this study\uff0c the WRF-CMAQ model was used to study the impacts of anthropogenic emission reduction on AOC during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Three representative cities in eastern China \uff08Shijiazhuang\uff0c Nanjing\uff0c and Guangzhou\uff09 were selected for an in-depth analysis to quantify the contribution of meteorology and emissions to the changes in AOC and oxidants and to discuss the impact of AOC changes on the formation of secondary pollutants. The results showed that\uff0c compared with that in the same period in 2019\uff0c the urban average AOC in Shijiazhuang\uff0c Nanjing\uff0c and Guangzhou in 2020 increased by 60%\uff0c 48.7%\uff0c and 12.6%\uff0c respectively. The concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>\uff0c hydroxyl radical \uff08\u00b7OH\uff09\uff0c and nitrogen trioxide \uff08NO<sub>3</sub>\u00b7\uff09 increased by 1.6%-26.4%\uff0c 14.8%-73.3%\uff0c and 37.9%-180%\uff0c respectively. The AOC in the three cities increased by 0.06\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>\uff0c 0.12\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>\uff0c and 0.33\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>\uff0c respectively\uff0c due to emission reduction. The meteorological change increased AOC in Shijiazhuang and Nanjing by 20% and 17.9%\uff0c respectively\uff0c but decreased AOC in Guangzhou by -9.3%. Enhanced AOC led to an increase in the nitrogen oxidation ratio \uff08NOR\uff09 and VOCs oxidation ratio \uff08VOR\uff09 and promoted the transformation of primary pollutants to secondary pollutants. This offset the effects of primary emission reduction and resulted in a nonlinear decline in secondary pollutants compared to emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lan", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Mo-Mei", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Environment Monitoring and Pollution Control, Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Disease Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38471902", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202303202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
