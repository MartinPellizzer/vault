However, in the summertime, there are observed short-term episodes of high ozone concentrations for which their impact on the population health is poorly documented. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of daily respiratory health problems related to an increased pollutants concentration typical for photochemical smog.", "In the ecological type of study, secondary epidemiological data were used. They were obtained from the National Health Fund (NFZ) in Katowice and included the number of outpatient visits in primary health care and hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases (J00-J99) and selected acute respiratory incidents registered between 01/01/2016 and 31/08/2017 in the Silesian Voivodeship.", "In the summertime of both years (2016 and 2017), there were observed short-term episodes of photochemical smog in the study region. Obtained results show a significant increase in the risk of outpatient visits due to total respiratory diseases, and also due to acute pharyngitis, acute laryngotracheitis, bronchitis, and asthma in response to the increase in ozone concentration. Similarly, a significant increase in the risk of hospitalization for all respiratory diseases was found, however, it appeared with a delay of at least two to three weeks. In the case of hospitalization due to bronchitis statistically significant risk was observed 2-4 days after the increase in exposure.", "The occurrence of registered respiratory incidents was confirmed in response to the increase in ozone concentration, characteristic of the summertime in the Silesian Voivodeship."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 National Institute of Public Health NIH \u2013 National Research Institute."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Health Sciences in Bytom, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland."}], "LastName": "Niewiadomska", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kowalska", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Health Sciences in Bytom, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland."}], "LastName": "Czech", "ForeName": "El\u017cbieta", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Przegl Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0413725", "ISSNLinking": "0033-2100"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36218177", "10.32394/pe.76.22"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
