We explored whether these factors, measured via the Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0, were associated with sleep health in adolescents.", "Actigraphy was used to assess sleep duration, timing, and efficiency among 110 adolescents in eighth (13.9 (0.4)) and ninth (14.9 (0.4)) grade. Home addresses were geocoded and linked to Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0 scores (including 3 subtype scores and the 29 individual factor Z-scores). Mixed-effects linear regression was used to determine associations between the Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0 scores and the sleep outcomes, adjusting for sex, race, parent education, household income, school grade and weeknight status. Interactions were also tested by school grade, weeknight status, sex, and race.", "No associations were observed between overall or subtype scores with sleep outcomes in adolescents. However, we detected associations between select individual Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0 Z-scores, spanning health & environment and education domains, and sleep outcomes. For example, greater fine particulate matter was associated with later timing of sleep onset and offset; ozone concentration was associated with earlier sleep onset and offset; greater exposure to extreme temperature was associated with later sleep onset and offset and increased odds of optimal sleep efficiency.", "Specific neighborhood factors indexed by the Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0 were associated with sleep health among adolescents. In particular, neighborhood air quality measures were associated with sleep timing and efficiency, warranting further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 National Sleep Foundation.
