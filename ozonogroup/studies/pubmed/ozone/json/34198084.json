To reveal the reaction sequence within the HOC process, the ibuprofen (IBP) removal efficiency of the ozonation only, HOC and HOC-PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> (inhibition of the reactions between ozone and metal coagulant) processes at pH 5 and different ozone dosages were investigated. The removal efficiency is almost the same for the three processes at a low ozone dosage (4.8 mg/L), and higher removal performance can be achieved by the HOC process with increasing ozone dosage. It can be implied that ozone preferentially reacts with OH<sup>-</sup> to generate OH which react with IBP in the HOC process, and subsequently reacts with the surface hydroxyl groups of hydrolysed Al species to enhance OH generation. Moreover, based on the kinetics, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses, the synergistic reactions between ozone and the metal coagulants (SOC) started to take effect from ozone dosage of 9.6 mg/L, which further verified that ozone will be involved in the IBP ozonation prior to the SOC reactions. The subsequent SOC reactions also resulted in the increased generation of polymeric Al species and more abundant intermediates in the HOC process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
