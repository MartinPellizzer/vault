Despite the critical effect of a typhoon on air pollution, contributions of vertical wind profile and cloud movement during transboundary air pollution (TAP) on surface PM and O<sub>3</sub> concentration have yet to be fully understood. This work is the first study to apply a network of Doppler light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as well as back trajectory analysis to comprehensively analyze the effect of a weak Typhoon (Danas) occurring during 16-19 July 2019 on different variations in PM and O<sub>3</sub> concentration. During the typhoon Danas, three types of surface air pollution with five episodes were identified: (1) low PM and high O<sub>3</sub> concentration; (2) co-occurring high PM and O<sub>3</sub> concentration and (3) high PM and low O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Employing our 3D Real-Time Atmospheric Monitoring System (3DREAMs) along with surface observations, we found the important role of TAP in the increases in surface PM and O<sub>3</sub> concentration with significant vertical wind shear that transported air pollutants at upper levels, and strong vertical mixing that brought air pollutants to the ground level. Cloud movement related to typhoon periphery, as well as high solar radiation due to sinking motion and remote transport by continental wind, have an impact on local O<sub>3</sub> concentration. For the substantial difference in O<sub>3</sub> concentration between two air quality measurement sites, the similar vertical aerosol distributions and wind profiles suggest the comparable TAP contributions at the two sites and thus infer the critical role of local O<sub>3</sub> photochemical process in the O<sub>3</sub> difference. This work comprehensively reveals the influences of a weak typhoon on variations in PM and O<sub>3</sub> during the five episodes, providing important references for air quality monitoring and forecast in regions under the influence of typhoon."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
