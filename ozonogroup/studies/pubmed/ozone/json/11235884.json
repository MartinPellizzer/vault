For example, with a 20-min EBCT, pH 7.5, and influent dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate concentrations 2.1 and 5.1 mg/l, respectively, 40% bromate removal was obtained with a 20 microg/l influent bromate concentration. In this study, DO, nitrate and sulfate concentrations, pH, and type of source water were evaluated for their effect on bromate removal in a BAC filter. Bromate removal decreased as the influent concentrations of DO and nitrate increased, but bromate removal was observed in the presence of measurable effluent concentrations of DO and nitrate. In contrast, bromate removal was not sensitive to the influent sulfate concentration, with only a slight reduction in bromate removal as the influent sulfate concentration was increased from 11.1 to 102.7 mg/l. Bromate reduction was better at lower pH values (6.8 and 7.2) than at higher pH values (7.5 and 8.2), suggesting that it may be possible to reduce bromate formation during ozonation and increase biological bromate reduction through pH control. Biological bromate removal in Lake Michigan water was very poor as compared to that in tapwater from a groundwater source. Bromate removal improved when sufficient organic electron donor was added to remove the nitrate and DO present in the Lake Michigan water, indicating that the poor biodegradability of the natural organic matter may have been limiting bromate removal in that water. Biological bromate removal was demonstrated to be a sustainable process under a variety of water quality conditions, and bromate removal can be improved by controlling key water quality parameters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Urbana 61801, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirisits", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Snoeyink", "ForeName": "V L", "Initials": "VL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inan", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chee-Sanford", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raskin", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Water Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0105072", "ISSNLinking": "0043-1354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Filtration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11235884", "10.1016/s0043-1354(00)00334-1", "S0043-1354(00)00334-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
