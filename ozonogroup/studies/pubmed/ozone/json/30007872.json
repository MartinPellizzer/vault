We questioned whether an acute exposure to 0.2\u202fppm ozone impaired olfactory functioning.", "Healthy, normosmic subjects were exposed according to a parallel group design either to 0.2\u202fppm ozone (n\u202f=\u202f15) or to sham (n\u202f=\u202f13) in an exposure chamber for two hours. Possible irritating effects were assessed by questionnaire (range 0-5). The detection threshold of n-butanol was measured with the Sniffin' Sticks test before and after exposure. Olfactory thresholds were logarithmized and a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measurements was carried out to test the effects of exposure (ozone vs. sham) and time (before vs. after exposure). Additionally, nasal secretions were taken at a preliminary examination and after exposure to determine interleukins 1\u00df and 8.", "No irritating effects to the upper airways were observed. In the ozone group, the median score for cough increased from 0 to 2 at the end of exposure (sham group 0 and 0, respectively, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The ANOVA showed a main effect for ozone exposure (F (1, 26)\u202f=\u202f27.6, p\u202f=\u202f0.0002), indicating higher olfactory thresholds in the ozone group.
