Cresols were selected as model substrates representing an important component of humic material. Cresols carry both a hydroxyl and a methyl group, each theoretically increasing the reactivity of ozone with the aromatic ring. Direct comparison of the aromatic ring and the methyl group reactivities was made possible by the analysis of reaction products. The substrate degradation kinetics was studied by preparing aqueous solutions of each cresol and treating them with ozone for increasing time periods. It had been hypothesized that hydroxybenzaldehydes and hydroxybenzoic acids could be possible degradation intermediates of cresols. To verify this hypothesis, the degradation kinetics of three hydroxybenzaldehydes and two hydroxybenzoic acids were also studied. The reaction products were studied using gas chromatography (GC)-electron capture negative ionization (ECNI)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis after direct derivatization of the samples with 5-chloro-2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-1-pentyl chloroformate (ClOFPCF). This new analytical approach enables the extraction and analysis of highly polar polycarboxylic and hydroxycarboxylic acids, as well as highly polar aldehydes and hydroxy aldehydes that are difficult to extract and measure using conventional methods. As such, this new approach offered insights into ozone reaction intermediates that had been previously hypothesized, but not confirmed. Several highly hydrophilic degradation intermediates were identified, including malic, citraconic, itaconic, malonic, methylmuconic, and tartronic acid, but no hydroxybenzaldehydes were observed. The results support a 3-stage mechanism previously hypothesized, which involves ring-opening of the phenolic group, followed by the generation of several intermediates of increasing oxidation state, finally leading to relatively stable products, such as malonic and oxalic acids. We demonstrated that oxidation of the methyl group does not occur during cresol degradation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
