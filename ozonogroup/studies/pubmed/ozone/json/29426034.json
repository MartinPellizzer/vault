The toxicity of metals also present in WWTP effluents strongly depends on their speciation. Therefore, knowledge on the change of the metal speciation during ozonation of a WWTP effluent is essential to assess possible negative impacts. The kinetics and the stoichiometries of the reactions of ozone with three metal sulfides (ZnS, CuS and CdS) and metal-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)/nitriloriacetic acid (NTA) complexes of Cu(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Mg(II) and Pb(II) were investigated. With a stoichiometric factor of 2.6-3.9 moles of ozone per mole of sulfide and apparent second-order rate constants at pH 8 > 10<sup>4</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>\u202fs<sup>-1</sup>, a complete oxidation of the sulfides and a concomitant release of the respective metals is expected during ozonation of a WWTP effluent for enhanced micropollutant abatement. The apparent second-order rate constants at pH 8 for the reactions of metal-EDTA complexes with ozone ranged from 42\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> to 2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>4</sup>\u202fM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and increased in the order Cd(II)\u202f<\u202fCu(II)\u202f<\u202fMg(II)\u202f<\u202fNi(II)\u202f<\u202fZn(II). Approximately 40% of Cd(II)-EDTA spiked to a WWTP effluent was oxidized at typical specific ozone doses of 0.5-0.7 g<sub>O3</sub>/g<sub>DOC</sub>. For the other metal-EDTA complexes a significantly higher fraction was oxidized. The bioavailable fraction determined by the diffusive-gradient thin films (DGT) method in the WWTP effluent increased during ozonation, due to the oxidative release of the metal ions. Algal toxicity (chlamynomodas reinhardtii) tests with CuS/CdS spiked WWTP effluent revealed a high tolerance toward Cu and Cd in the respective media. A toxic response was only observed at Cu concentrations above 10\u202f\u03bcM, which is above typical WWTP effluent concentrations. Biological post-treatment after ozonation generally reduced the bioavailability of the metals, which resulted in a lower toxicity. Therefore, the biological post-treatment serves as an additional barrier to protect the downstream ecology of receiving waters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
