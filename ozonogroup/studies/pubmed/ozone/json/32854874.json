Amidst the growing pollutants, ground-level ozone has become an important component in understanding health, and productivity of agricultural crops. In this regard spatio-temporal analysis of tropospheric ozone for wheat, rice and cotton crops was carried out. Followed-up with a multivariate regression model; establishing a statistical relationship between tropospheric ozone (TO) and crop productivity. The results indicate that predominantly ozone is increasing, with a significant trend visible in all crop growing seasons. Observations indicate higher concentrations of TO in the rice & cotton growing seasons, with a seasonal average of 68\u00a0ppb, compared to wheat growing season (55\u00a0ppb). Regression results specify that with an increase of 1% in tropospheric ozone concentration within the study area; crop productivity decreases for cotton (-4.0%), rice (-2.3%), and wheat (-0.7%). Furthermore, with the presence of the dominant tropospheric ozone in the regression model, the temperature's impact on productivity becomes statistically inconsequential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
