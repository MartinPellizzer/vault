Their risk of developing skin cancer may be enhanced. Solar erythemal UV irradiance and exposure were measured for the first time on merchant vessels going along typical international routes at low latitudes. The measurements taken at horizontal incidence on the observation deck, and on different parts of the seaman (head, shoulder, chest and back) doing typical outdoor work show the highest portion (40-80% of horizontal exposure) incident on the head. 2\u00a0years of measurements of solar UV and VIS/NIR irradiance taken on the mast top of the Research Vessel METEOR were added to the data base. Radiative transfer model calculations were performed along all the routes with satellite-based input data of ozone and aerosol for clear sky health-effective radiation including vitamin D3 (VD3). Measured data show extremely high noontime UV index values up to 19 with clear sky, and up to 22 due to cloud scattering. Eight hours erythemal exposure values are more than double of typical midlatitude summer values. Based on the results, an algorithm is presented to derive a seafarer's personal erythemal exposure according to his/her personal record of sea service."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2013 The American Society of Photobiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "German Meteorological Service, Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg - Richard-A\u00dfmann-Observatory, Lindenberg, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feister", "ForeName": "Uwe", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meyer", "ForeName": "Gabriele", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirst", "ForeName": "Ulrich", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Climate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["23875870", "10.1111/php.12144"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
