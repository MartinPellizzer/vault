Accurate forecasting of ozone concentration enables relevant authorities to enact timely policies to mitigate adverse impacts. This study develops a novel hybrid deep learning model, named wind direction-based dynamic spatio-temporal graph network (WDDSTG-Net), for hourly ozone concentration prediction. The model uses a dynamic directed graph structure based on hourly changing wind direction data to capture evolving spatial relationships between air quality monitoring stations. It applied the graph attention mechanism to compute dynamic weights between connected stations, thereby aggregating neighborhood information adaptively. For temporal modeling, it utilized a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism to extract long-range temporal dependencies. Additionally, it integrated meteorological predictions to guide the ozone forecasting. The model achieves a mean absolute error of 6.69\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> and 18.63\u00a0\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> for 1-h prediction and 24-h prediction, outperforming several classic models. The model's IAQI accuracy predictions at all stations are above 75\u00a0%, with a maximum of 81.74\u00a0%. It also exhibits strong capabilities in predicting severe ozone pollution events, with a 24-h true positive rate of 0.77. Compared to traditional static graph models, WDDSTG-Net demonstrates the importance of incorporating short-term wind fluctuations and transport dynamics for data-driven air quality modeling. In principle, it may serve as an effective data-driven approach for the concentration prediction of other airborne pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
