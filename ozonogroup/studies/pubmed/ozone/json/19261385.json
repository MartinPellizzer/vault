The O(3) removal efficiency was determined at various operating variables including RPB speed, gas flow rate, and liquid flow rate in three RPBs. For each RPB, the results demonstrated that the RPB speed positively affected the O(3) removal efficiency. Also, the O(3) removal efficiency increased with the liquid flow rate but decreased with the gas flow rate. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that the O(3) removal efficiency increased as the inner radius of the bed was increased and the outer radius of the bed was decreased. Furthermore, the developed method for O(3) absorption using H(2)O(2) solution could provide the removal efficiency of more than 95%. Consequently, the novel method would have a great potential in the removal of O(3) from the exhausted gases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, ROC. higee@mail.cgu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chia-Chang", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Mei-Yun", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ya-Ling", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19261385", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.01.092", "S0304-3894(09)00128-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
