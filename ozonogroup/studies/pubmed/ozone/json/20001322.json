Ozone gas (generated by OzoTop, Tip Top Tips, Rolle, Switzerland), sodium hypochlorite, and hydrogen peroxide were used for comparison. ROS production was estimated using an iodine-triiodide colorimetric assay, and ROS levels were plotted versus concentration of chemicals to determine each chemical's efficiency in ROS production. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis (alpha = 0.05) was used to compare the efficiencies of ROS production for the various chemicals.", "Sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone gas produced ROS spontaneously, whereas pheophorbide-a-PLL, riboflavin, and toluidine blue required light exposure. The efficiency of ROS production was higher for pheophorbide-a-PLL and toluidine blue than for ozone gas or riboflavin (p < 0.05). Hydrogen peroxide was the least efficient ROS producer.", "The results of the current study support the use of blue- or red-light-absorbing photosensitizers as candidates to produce ROS for clinical applications. Blue-light photosensitizers were as efficient as red-light photosensitizers in producing ROS and more efficient than the oxidant chemicals currently used for dental disinfection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endodontics Unit, Section of Dental Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.
