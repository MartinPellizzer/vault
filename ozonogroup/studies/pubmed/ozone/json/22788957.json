The effectiveness of ozone was explored as an alternative to chlorine in produce washing for ensuring microbial safety while maximizing water reusability.", "An ozone washing system was designed to permit continuous addition of contaminated produce and the reuse of washing water. The effectiveness of ozonation (<2\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) ) was determined using Bacillus subtilis spores as a stricter measure of efficiency with processing time of 10\u00a0min. As a comparison, chlorine (c.\u00a0100\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) ) was tested in parallel. Water quality characteristics, including chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, disinfectants concentration and microbial reduction were measured. Ozonation showed an average of 1\u00b756 log reduction of B.\u00a0subtilis spores on lettuce, while chlorination achieved a 1\u00b730 log reduction. The effluents after ozonation demonstrated improved water quality, both in physicochemical quality and microbial quality compared to chlorination.", "Aqueous ozone treatment is effective against microbial contaminants on fresh produce and enables extended use of washing water.", "The results provide significant data about ozone disinfection efficacy and its impact on the water reusability, which can facilitate the ozone utilization in the fresh produce production as an environmental friendly alternative."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2012 The Authors Journal of Applied Microbiology \u00a9 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health Sciences, College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenblum", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bohrerova", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disinfectants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfectants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Disinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Quality"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22788957", "10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05393.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
