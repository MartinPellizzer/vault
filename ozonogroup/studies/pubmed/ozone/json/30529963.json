The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological and biochemical adjustments adopted by pomegranate (Punica granatum L. cv. Dente di cavallo) under realistic field conditions. One-year-old saplings were exposed to O<sub>3</sub> [two levels denoted as ambient (AO) and elevated (EO) O<sub>3</sub> concentrations] and salinity [S (salt, 50\u202fmM NaCl)] for three consecutive months. No salt (NS) plants received distilled water. Despite the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in the aboveground biomass, no evidence of visible injury due to salt (e.g. tip yellow-brown lesions) was found. The maintenance of leaf water status (i.e. unchanged values of electrolytic leakage and relative water content), the significant increase of abscisic acid, proline and starch content (+98, +65 and +59% compared to AO_NS) and stomatal closure (-24%) are suggested to act as adaptive mechanisms against salt stress in AO_S plants. By contrast, EO_NS plants were unable to protect cells against the negative impact of O<sub>3</sub>, as confirmed by the reduction of the CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate (-21%), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (+10 and +225% of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide) and malondialdehyde by-product (about 2-fold higher than AO_NS). Plants tried to preserve themselves from further oxidative damage by adopting some biochemical adjustments [i.e. increase in proline content (+41%) and induction of catalase activity (8-fold higher than in AO_NS)]. The interaction of the two stressors induced responses considerably different to those observed when each stressor was applied independently. An analysis of the antioxidant pool revealed that the biochemical adjustments adopted by P. granatum under EO_S conditions (e.g. reduction of total ascorbate; increased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase) were not sufficient to ameliorate the O<sub>3</sub>-induced oxidative stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
