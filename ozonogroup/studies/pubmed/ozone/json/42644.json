Hen egg-white lysozyme was ozonized in aqueous solution to yield one N'-formylkynurenine residue and deformylated with hydrochloric acid in frozen solution at -10 degrees C. Crude Kyn 62-lysozyme was purified by affinity and Bio Rex 70 chromatography successively. Kyn 62-lysozyme retains affinity for chitin and is essentially an active enzyme with a slightly weakened but distinct catalytic activity. After this modification, the enzyme activity was changed differently depending on the kind of substrate. At the individual optimum pH's, lytic activity was largely retained (80% active), but the catalytic efficiency for hydrolyzing glycol chitin was relatively low (30% active). Lysis of M. lysodeikticus cell suspensions was optimally catalyzed by Kyn 62-lysozyme at pH 6.2 and at 0.088 ionic strength. These values are lower by 1.3 pH unit and 0.04 ionic strength, respectively, than those of intact lysozyme. The optimum pH and ionic strength for the hydrolysis of neutral substrates were scarcely affected. These results suggest the significance of electrostatic interaction in the lysis of lysozyme. Relatively limited loss of activity induced by modification of the 62nd residue, which is thought to participate directly in the binding of the substrate at subsite C, is discussed on the basis of the similarity of side chain structure in tryptophan and kynurenine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamasaki", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsujita", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuda", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mizuno", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakiyama", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "343-65-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Kynurenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8DUH1N11BX", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptophan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Muramidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egg White"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kynurenine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muramidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tryptophan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["42644", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a132645"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
