Lipid droplets with various surface charges were prepared by homogenizing corn oil and water in the presence of surfactants with different electrical characteristics: non-ionic (Tween 80, T80), cationic (lauric arginate, LAE), and/or anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS). The ionic properties of polyethylene surfaces were modified by UV-treatment. Stable emulsions containing small droplets (d<200 nm) with nearly neutral (T80), cationic (T80: LAE), and anionic (T80: SDS) charges were prepared by adding different levels of the ionic surfactants to Tween 80 stabilized emulsions. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), confocal fluorescence microscopy, and ATR-FTIR showed that the number of droplets attached to the polyethylene surfaces depended on the droplet charge and the polyethylene surface characteristics. The greatest degree of droplet adsorption was observed for the cationic droplets to the UV-ozone treated polyethylene surfaces, which was attributed to electrostatic attraction. These results are important for understanding the behavior of encapsulated lipophilic components in food containers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.
