The R<sub>ct</sub> concept, which is defined as the ratio of OH exposure to O<sub>3</sub> exposure, has been widely used to predict the removal efficiency of target compounds, but it has significant variations by water temperature and initial O<sub>3</sub> dose which are crucial parameters in drinking water plant. The R<sub>OH,O3</sub> concept, which is defined as the OH exposure by O<sub>3</sub> consumption, was proposed as a kinetic parameter for characterization and kinetic modeling for ozonation. The R<sub>OH,O3</sub> concept is independent of temperature and initial O<sub>3</sub> dose. A higher R<sub>OH,O3</sub> value indicates a higher OH formation when the same amount of O<sub>3</sub> is consumed in different water samples; therefore, the OH yield from O<sub>3</sub> decomposition of the water samples can be compared using the R<sub>OH,O3</sub> values. The R<sub>OH,O3</sub> concept can also be used to characterize and model the initial ozone demand phase, and it is more convenient method compared to Rct concept. Using the R<sub>OH,O3</sub> concept, the dynamic O<sub>3</sub> and OH kinetics and the removal efficiencies of iopromide and ibuprofen were well predicted (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.98) over a wide range of experimental conditions (n\u00a0=\u00a0124)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
