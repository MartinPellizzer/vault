Ozonation is crucial to remove LMW-DON, but selectivity mechanisms of different reactive oxygen species were unknown. Here, reactions of O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH with LMW-DON at different dosages were determined from composition, unsaturation/redox potential, and precursor-product relationship. The molecular weight of LMW-DON in CL presented a normal distribution and 76.5% was below 450\u00a0Da. LMW-DON with 400-1000\u00a0Da increased to 55.6%-66.7% and O/C<sub>wa</sub> increased by over 40.0% due to electrophilic substitution of O<sub>3</sub>. LMW-DON with <400\u00a0Da and 550-1000\u00a0Da were preferentially degraded by <sup>\u2022</sup>OH at the low and high O<sub>3</sub> dosage, respectively. O<sub>3</sub> preferred to remove lipid-like (69.1%), protein-like (58.2%), and amino sugars-like (72.8%) LMW-DON, whereas <sup>\u2022</sup>OH preferred to the refractory LMW-DON, such as carbohydrates-like (71.1%), lignin-like (49.6%), and tannins-like (72.5%) LMW-DON. Forty-three transformation reactions were quantified using mass difference analysis, and O<sub>3</sub> preferred to oxygen addition (e.g., +2O) and conversed amino to nitro groups, and saturated LMW-DON increased via unsaturated bonds rupture. <sup>\u2022</sup>OH attacked the carbon groups (e.g., -CH<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen groups (e.g., -NH<sub>3</sub>+O, -NO<sub>2</sub>+H). These findings provide molecular evidence for the selectivity of oxidants with LMW-DON and improve the ozonation application in wastewater treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
