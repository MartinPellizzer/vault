Four high-ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) days and twenty-seven non-high-O<sub>3</sub> days were identified according to the China's National Standard Level II (\u223c100\u202fppbv). The occurrence of high-O<sub>3</sub> days was accompanied by tropical cyclones. Much higher concentrations of VOCs and carbon monoxide (CO) were observed on the high-O<sub>3</sub> days (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Model simulations revealed that vehicle exhausts were the dominant sources of VOCs, contributing 45.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2% and 37.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.9% during high-O<sub>3</sub> and non-high-O<sub>3</sub> days, respectively. Both vehicle exhausts and stationary combustion made significantly larger contributions to O<sub>3</sub> production on high-O<sub>3</sub> days (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Analysis using a chemical transport model found that local photochemical formation accounted for 74.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.8% of the daytime O<sub>3</sub>, around twice the regional transport (32.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.4%), while the nighttime O<sub>3</sub> was mainly attributable to regional transport (59.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.9%). The local O<sub>3</sub> formation was generally limited by VOCs in urban Wuhan. To effectively control O<sub>3</sub> pollution, the reduction ratio of VOCs to NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations should not be lower than 0.73, and the most efficient O<sub>3</sub> abatement could be achieved by reducing VOCs from vehicle exhausts. This study contributes to the worldwide database of O<sub>3</sub>-VOC-NO<sub>x</sub> sensitivity research. Its findings will be helpful in formulating and implementing emission control strategies for dealing with O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Wuhan."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
