The experiments were carried out under various UV light intensities and wavelengths, ozone dosages, and initial concentrations of TCE to investigate and compare the removal efficiency of the pollutant. For UV/TiO2 process, the individual contribution to the decomposition of TCE by direct photolysis and hydroxyl radicals destruction was differentiated to discuss the quantum efficiency with 254 and 365 nm UV lamps. The removal of gaseous TCE was found to reduce by UV/TiO2 process in the presence of ozone possibly because of the ozone molecules could scavenge hydroxyl radicals produced from the excitation of TiO2 by UV radiation to inhibit the decomposition of TCE. A photoreactor design equation for the decomposition of gaseous TCE by the UV/TiO2 process in air streams was developed by combining the continuity equation of the pollutant and the surface catalysis reaction rate expression. By the proposed design scheme, the temporal distribution of TCE at various operation conditions by the UV/TiO2 process can be well modeled."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Chang-Hwa, Taiwan, ROC. ysshen@mail.dyu.edu.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15FIX9V2JP", "NameOfSubstance": "titanium dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "290YE8AR51", "NameOfSubstance": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D1JT611TNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Titanium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gases"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Titanium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trichloroethylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11806520", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00585-3", "S0045-6535(00)00585-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
