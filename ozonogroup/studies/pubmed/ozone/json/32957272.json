As an indispensable part of the water treatment process, disinfection plays an important role in controlling antibiotic resistance. At present, there were many studies on the effects of conventional and new sterilization methods on ARB and ARGs. However, there is a lack of literature relating to the limitations of conventional methods and analysis of new techniques. Therefore, this review focuses on analyzing the deficiencies of conventional disinfection and the development of new methods for antibiotic resistance control to guide future research. Firstly, we analyzed the effects and drawbacks of conventional disinfection methods, such as chlorine (Cl), ultraviolet (UV) and ozone on antibiotic resistance control. Secondly, we discuss the research progress and shortcomings of new sterilization methods in antibiotic resistance. Finally, we propose suggestions for future research directions. There is an urgent need for new effective and low-cost sterilization methods. Disinfection via UV and chlorine in combination, UV/chlorine showed greater potential for controlling ARGs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
