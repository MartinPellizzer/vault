Alternatively, monitoring the variations and abundance of different classes and compounds after treatments might be a useful approach in OSPW remediation. In this study, the variations in the compositions of classical and heteroatomic naphthenic acids (NAs) after treatment using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), mainly ozone and peroxone, and two different mass spectrometry methods; ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight (UPLC-TOFMS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR-MS), were examined. Two markers (O<sub>2</sub>S:O<sub>3</sub>S:O<sub>4</sub>S and O<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>4</sub> ratios) were used to reveal changes and similarities of the treated water characteristics with those in natural waters. Both ratios decreased after all treatments, from 2.7:4.8:2.1 and 3.59 in raw OSPW to 0:1.4:0.5 and 0.7, respectively, in peroxone (1:2), becoming close to the reported ratios in natural waters. Toxicity toward Vibrio fischeri showed residual toxic effects after AOPs, suggesting that part of OSPW toxicity may be caused by specific compounds of NAs (i.e., similar reduction (50%) was achieved in both toxicity and abundance in O<sub>2</sub> species with carbon 15-26) and/or generated by-products (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>S classes at double bond equivalent (DBE)\u00a0=\u00a04 and C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at DBE\u00a0=\u00a04). Although by-products were generated, the best biodegradability enhancement and chemical oxygen demand reduction were achieved in peroxone (1:2) compared to ozone, suggesting the possibility of using combined OSPW remediation approaches (i.e., peroxone coupled with biological process). The recommended indicators can assist in evaluating the treatments' performance and in examining the best removal levels to accomplish significant toxicity reduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
