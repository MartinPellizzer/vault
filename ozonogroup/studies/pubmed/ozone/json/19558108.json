The experimental results showed that dissolved organic matters (DOC) with Mr lower than 10(3) accounted for 80% of the total. The removal rate of DOC and SUVA (UV254/DOC) were 8% and 14% respectively by traditional treatment process with main removalonly for ones with Mr higher than 100 x 10(3). Only 30% of DOC and 31% of SUVA were decreased by O3-BAC process for the removal of ones with Mr between 10(3) and 5 x 10(3), in which the biotic degradation was certainly restricted by predominant organic matters of hydrophilic and Mr was lower than 1000. An obvious increase of BrO3(-) occurred in the effluent from ozone oxidation process when the dose of ozone beyond 2 mg/L which increased Br(-) concentration. This could increase the product of BrO3(-). A poor and unstable removal effect of BrO3(-) was observed in the effluent of BAC process during the experiment. Each species of THMs, decreasing 40% of total, was reduced by O3-BAC treatment compared with the traditional treatment process. But the products of brominated trihalomethanes, especially CHBr3 would be markedly increased by enhanced chlorine dosage and Br(-) concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes, Ministry of Education, Hohai University, Nanjing 210098, China. hit_lintao@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lei-Lei", "Initials": "LL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bromates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trihalomethanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Water Purification"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19558108"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
