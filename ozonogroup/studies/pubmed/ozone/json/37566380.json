Most of sterilization methods are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks without compromising the filtration efficiency of the masks. In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on KF94 face masks, we show that the virus loses its infectivity with a 4 log reduction when exposed for 10 s to 120 ppm ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator. Scanning electron microscopy, particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), and inhalation resistance tests revealed that there was no detectable structural or functional deterioration observed in the electrocharged filter layer of Korea Filter (KF) 94 masks even after their excessive exposure to ozone. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) showed decreases in amplification efficiency of HCoV-229E RNA recovered from masks exposed to ozone, indicating the damage to the RNA by the ozone treatment. Our results demonstrate that the plasma generator rapidly disinfects contaminated face masks at least five times without compromising filtration efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 American Chemical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jinyeop", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Bong", "ForeName": "Cheolwoo", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Wanyoung", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BioNano Health Guard Research Center (H-GUARD), Daejeon 34141, Korea."}], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Pan Kee", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Abafogi", "ForeName": "Abdurhaman Teyib", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Seung Ho", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BioNano Health Guard Research Center (H-GUARD), Daejeon 34141, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bionanotechnology Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, KRIBB School, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon 34141, Korea."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Yong-Beom", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Institute for Convergence at SKKU (BICS), Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Bak", "ForeName": "Moon Soo", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3062-1302"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Institute for Convergence at SKKU (BICS), Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Quantum Biophysics (iQB), Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sungsu", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Sci Technol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101628367"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no competing financial interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37566380", "10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
