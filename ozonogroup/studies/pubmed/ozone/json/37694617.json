The results showed that the ozone concentration in Ji'nan gradually increased from 2015 to 2020. The annual 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of the daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub>(namely the annual evaluation value) and the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>(April-September) increased by 4.8 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup> and 3.8 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The trend of the ozone levels in the high-concentration range increased faster than that in the low-concentration range. The MDA8 in June increased by 7.4 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, and the rate range of increases was 2.6-3.9 \u03bcg\u00b7(m<sup>3</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup> in the cool seasons (December-February); thus, the O<sub>3</sub> control in winter cannot be ignored. It is apparent from the diurnal variations in ozone from 2015 to 2020 in April-September that the average ozone levels have risen in recent years. The growth rate in the daytime was higher than that at night. The capacity of photochemical production has been increasing, especially in recent years. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the peak time for ozone levels occurred approximately 1-2 h earlier. The disparity of ozone concentrations among different stations gradually decreased in recent years. Compared with that in 2015, the range of areas with high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in 2019-2020 was further expanded. The significant positive trends in MDA8-90<sup>th</sup> and MDA8 (April-September) were observed in 16.1% and 22.6% of the monitoring sites in Ji'nan (<i>P</i><0.05), most of which were located in urban areas and the suburbs close to urban areas. The temporal and spatial changes in ozone in Jinan had been affected by the changes in VOCs and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions since 2015. Satellite remote sensing data from 2015 to 2020 revealed that the NO<sub>2</sub> tropospheric columns (April-September) showed reductions of 20.6%, with a decreasing rate of 0.3\u00d710<sup>15</sup> mole\u00b7(cm<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a)<sup>-1</sup>, especially in the urban areas and suburbs. The detected variation trends of tropospheric HCHO were weak and insignificant, which suggested that the decrease in NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> emissions was much greater than the decrease in VOCs emissions, and the gap had become more obvious in the urban areas. With responses to precursor emissions, the chemical sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> formation had been changing. The VOCs-limited regimes continuously decreased, and the mixed NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>/VOCs-sensitive regimes and NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-limited regimes increased. In general, such an extremely inappropriate control ratio of ozone precursor NO<sub><i>x</i></sub>/VOCs led to an overall trend of slow increasing fluctuations of O<sub>3</sub> in Ji'nan. The findings clearly indicate that the reduction of VOCs in Ji'nan was far from sufficient, and strengthening the current control of VOCs emissions is an effective measure to control the growth trend of O<sub>3</sub> pollution in Ji'nan in the near future, especially in urban and surrounding suburban areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Meng-Meng", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qilu University of Technology, Jinan 250353, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Guo-Lan", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hong-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center, Shandong Province, Jinan 250101, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Teng-Long", "Initials": "TL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37694617", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202209088"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
