Ozone, the principle component of summer smog, is the most pervasive air pollutant in the United States. The risks associated with ozone and other air pollutants are especially increased for children and adults with asthma (2); however, children with no underlying pulmonary diseases also are at risk for adverse health effects associated with these pollutants (3). In addition, because children of racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to reside in areas with higher air pollution levels, they may be exposed to higher levels of ozone (4). This report presents the findings of an analysis by the American Lung Association (ALA) to characterize pediatric populations potentially at risk for adverse health effects from exposure to ozone air pollution in the United States during 1991-1993."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "CollectiveName": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "7802429", "ISSNLinking": "0149-2195"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smog"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smog"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7715588"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
