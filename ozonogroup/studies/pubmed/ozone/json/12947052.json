It is less clear what impact O3-reduced source strength has on the physiological responses of sink tissue such as fine roots. The responses were investigated of carbon acquisition in leaves and carbon utilization in the respiration of fine roots, following chronic (weeks) and acute (hours) exposures to O3 in open top chambers. Previous reports indicate increased, decreased, and unchanged rates of root respiration following exposure to O3. A decline in source activity is confirmed, but an increase in sink respiration is reported in fine roots of Pima cotton (cv. S-6) and muskmelon (cv. Ambrosia hybrid). Leaf source strength and root sink activity changed in opposing directions, thus there was no positive correlation that might indicate direct substrate control of root function. Additional linkages between shoot and root following exposure to O3 may be involved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Sciences and Air Pollution Research Center, University of California at Riverside, Kearney Agricultural Center, 9240 South Riverbend Ave, Parlier, CA 93648, USA. dgrantz@uckac.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grantz", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toyota", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ott", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gossypium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12947052", "10.1093/jxb/erg261", "erg261"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
