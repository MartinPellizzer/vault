However, foodborne bacteria can adapt and survive by physicochemical regulation of antioxidant systems, especially through central carbon metabolism (CCM), which is a significant concern for food safety. It is thus necessary to study the antioxidant regulation mechanisms of CCM in foodborne bacteria under toxROS stresses. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide an update and comprehensive overview of the reconfiguration of CCM fluxes in foodborne bacteria that respond to different toxROS stresses. In this review, two key types of toxROS including exogenous toxROS (exo-toxROS) and endogenous toxROS (endo-toxROS) are introduced. Exo-toxROS are produced by disinfectants, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and HOCl, or during food non-thermal processing such as ultraviolet (UV/UVA), cold plasma (CP), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), electrolyzed water (EW), pulsed electric field (PEF), pulsed light (PL), and electron beam (EB) processing. Endo-toxROS are generated by bioreagents such as antibiotics (aminoglycosides, quinolones, and \u03b2-lactams). Three main pathways for CCM in foodborne bacteria under the toxROS stress are also highlighted, which are glycolysis (EMP), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In addition, energy metabolisms throughout these pathways are discussed. Finally, challenges and future work in this area are suggested. It is hoped that this review should be beneficial in providing insights for future research on bacterial antioxidant CCM defence under both exo-toxROS stresses and endo-toxROS stresses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Jun-Hu", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Sang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3634-9963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Contemporary Food Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering and Technological Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Intelligent Sensing and Process Control of Cold Chain Foods, Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Cold Chain Logistics Equipment for Agricultural Products, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Refrigeration and Computerized Food Technology (FRCFT), Agriculture and Food Science Centre, University College Dublin, National University of Ireland, Dublin 4, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Da-Wen", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36688292", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2169245"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
