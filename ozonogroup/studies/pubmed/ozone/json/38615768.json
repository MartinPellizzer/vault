NOx may play a crucial role in altering the composition of the atmosphere, particularly regarding ozone formation in the upper troposphere. At present, the ground emission database based on the landing and takeoff (LTO) cycle is more comprehensive, while high-altitude emission data is scarce due to the prohibitively high cost and the inevitable measurement uncertainty associated with in-flight sampling. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive NOx emission database for the entire flight envelope, encompassing both ground and cruise phases. This will enable a thorough assessment of the impact of aviation NOx emissions on climate and air quality. In this study, a prediction model has been developed via convolutional neural network (CNN) technology. This model can predict the ground and cruise NOx emission index for turbofan engines and mixed turbofan engines fueled by either conventional aviation kerosene or sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). The model utilizes data from the engine emission database (EEDB) released by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and results obtained from several in-situ emission measurements conducted during ground and cruise phases. The model has been validated by comparing measured and predicted data, and the results demonstrate its high prediction accuracy for both the ground (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.95) and cruise phases (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.9). This surpasses traditional prediction models that rely on fuel flow rate, such as the Boeing Fuel Flow Method 2 (BFFM2). Furthermore, the model can predict NOx emissions from aircrafts burning SAFs with satisfactory accuracy, facilitating the development of a more complete and accurate aviation NOx emission inventory, which can serve as a basis for aviation environmental and climatic research. SYNOPSIS: The utilization of the ANOEPM-CNN offers a foundation for establishing more precise emission inventories, thereby reducing inaccuracies in assessing the impact of aviation NOx emissions on climate and air quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
