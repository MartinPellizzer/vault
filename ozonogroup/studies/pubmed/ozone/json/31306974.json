A considerable improvement in the energy efficiency for organic compounds removal has been observed when reducing the width of the discharge pulses. This finding was correlated with the efficient formation of oxidizing species in case of short pulses. Recycling of the effluent gas from the plasma also enhances contaminants degradation. This was mainly attributed to an in situ peroxone process, i.e. the reaction between plasma-generated O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, forming highly reactive OH radicals, largely responsible for organic compounds degradation. This assumption is supported by the decline in O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations and simultaneous increase in OH concentration detected in plasma-ozonation experiments as compared to results obtained with plasma alone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
