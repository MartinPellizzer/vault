SCOB was evaluated for its ability to degrade and detoxify tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). Biodegradation alone only resulted in negligible TCH removal, while ozone alone caused less effective performance, with TCH degradation rate constants of 29-171% lower than those of SCOB. The optimal ozone dose was 2.0\u00a0mg-O<sub>3</sub>/(L\u00b7h), and it contributed to remove 97% of the TCH within 2\u00a0h under SCOB operation. The SCOB effluent was not toxic to S. aureus after 8\u00a0h of exposure. During six SCOB operation cycles, the biomass in the biofilm remained stable, and cell structure was relatively intact. SCOB significantly improved TCH degradation and reduced toxicity of the effluent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
