Dyspnea improves with appropriate measures that enhance physical performance and treatment of the underlying diseases. Dyspnea is less commonly triggered by other causes such as the environment (e.g., ozone), drugs, and others, some of which do not seem to affect bronchopulmonary function as evidenced by normal results of comprehensive pulmonary function testing. In cardiovascular medicine, dyspnea has recently attracted attention because it has been reported that this symptom occurs more frequently with the administration of the new oral reversibly-binding platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors ticagrelor [1-6], cangrelor [7-10], and elinogrel [11]. This paper succinctly addresses the current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostics of dyspnea, associated either with bronchopulmonary function impairment, as triggered mainly by pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, or without bronchopulmonary function impairment, as induced by endogenous or external compounds such as drugs in order to provide a context for understanding, recognizing and managing P2Y12 inhibitor-induced dyspnea."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
