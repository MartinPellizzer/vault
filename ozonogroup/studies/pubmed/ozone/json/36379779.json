In this work, the grand canonical density functional theory method was applied to simulate the explicit electrocatalytic process of oxygen evolution reaction and electrochemical ozone production due to the O<sub>3</sub> product sensitivity toward the applied potential. Over the Pt/Pd single atom embedded on B/N co-doped graphene (Pt/Pd-BNC) surface, crossover points of O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> selectivity inversion were predicted to be 1.33 and 0.89\u00a0V vs standard hydrogen electrode, which were also consistent with the previous experimental results. An in-depth analysis of the energetic terms in the reaction free energies also found the considerable impact of the applied potential on the Helmholtz free energy term, with optimal potential predicted for the key elementary steps, and linear correlations between electrode potential (U) and reaction free energy were found for each elementary step. This study offers extensive knowledge on the potential effect on the O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> selective formation on two-dimensional anode surfaces and provides new insights for investigating the reactivity/selectivity on electrode surfaces in real reaction conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ge", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wenwen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Xing", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Zihao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Shengwei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shibin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2391-4529"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Industrial Catalysis, State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Green-Chemical Synthesis Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36379779", "10.1063/5.0117828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
