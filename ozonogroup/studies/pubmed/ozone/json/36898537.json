However, it remains unclear whether these effects on aboveground parts further change the root resource management strategy and the relationships of fine root respiration and biomass with other physiological traits. In this study, an open-top chamber experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of O<sub>3</sub> alone and in combination with nitrogen (N) addition on root production and fine root respiration of poplar clone 107 (Populus\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0euramericana cv. '74/76'). Saplings were grown with (100\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup>) or without (+0\u00a0kg\u00a0ha<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0year<sup>-1</sup>) N addition under two O<sub>3</sub> regimes (non-filtered ambient air or non-filtered ambient air\u00a0+\u00a060\u00a0ppb of O<sub>3</sub>). After about two to three months of treatment, elevated O<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased fine root biomass and starch content but increased fine root respiration, which occurred in tandem with inhibited leaf light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A<sub>sat</sub>). Nitrogen addition did not change fine root respiration or biomass, neither did it alter the effect of elevated O<sub>3</sub> on the fine root traits. However, N addition weakened the relationships of fine root respiration and biomass with A<sub>sat</sub>, fine root starch and N concentrations. No significant relationships of fine root biomass and respiration with soil mineralized N were observed under elevated O<sub>3</sub> or N addition. These results imply that changed relationships of plant fine root traits under global changes should be considered into earth system process models to project more accurately future carbon cycle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
