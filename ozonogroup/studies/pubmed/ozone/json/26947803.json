Both substrates were rapidly eliminated within 2min at low ozone dose of 0.3mgL<sup>-1</sup> and the experimental data were well fitted in the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The ratio of HO- and O<sub>3</sub>-exposure (R<sub>ct</sub>) at the inherent pH was found to be 1.9\u00d710<sup>-8</sup>. The degradation of ERY and EtP was pronounced at pH 8 compared to acidic pH conditions, while the degradation rate of both substrates was found to be matrix-depended. It was also shown that both O<sub>3</sub>- and HO-mediated pathways are involved in the degradation of EtP, whereas the saturated-rich structure of ERY renders it O<sub>3</sub>-recalcitrant. Under the optimum O<sub>3</sub> dose, the BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration was found to be lower than 10\u03bcgL<sup>-1</sup>. Five and fifteen transformation products were elucidated during ERY and EtP oxidation, respectively. The root and shoot inhibition can be attributed to the oxidation products formed upon dissolved effluent organic matter transformation. Escherichia coli harbouring resistance to ERY survived ozonation better than EtP-resistant E. coli. However, neither ERY- nor EtP-resistant E. coli were detected after 15min of ozonation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
