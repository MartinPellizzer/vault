The classical trajectory calculations are performed on the lowest 2A' and 2A\" potential energy surfaces, which were calculated by ab initio methods. The calculated room temperature exchange reaction rate coefficient, kex, is in very good agreement with the measured one. The high-pressure recombination rate coefficient, which is given by the formation rate coefficient and to a good approximation equals 2kex, overestimates the experimental data by merely 20%. The pressure dependence of the recombination rate, kr, is described within the strong-collision model by assigning a stabilization probability to each individual trajectory. The measured falloff curve is well reproduced over five orders of magnitude by a single parameter, i.e., the strong-collision stabilization frequency. The calculations also yield the correct temperature dependence, kr proportional, T-1.5, of the low-pressure recombination rate coefficient. The dependence of the rate coefficients on the oxygen isotopes are investigated by incorporating the difference of the zero-point energies between the reactant and product NO radicals, DeltaZPE, into the potential energy surface. Similar isotope effects as for ozone are predicted for both the exchange reaction and the recombination. Finally, we estimate that the chaperon mechanism is not important for the recombination of NO2, which is in accord with the overall T-1.4 dependence of the measured recombination rate even in the low temperature range."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Dynamik und Selbstorganisation, D-37073 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. mivanov@gwdg.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schinke", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "0375360", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9606"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17302474", "10.1063/1.2430715"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
