DES-rich phase was induced to form in the bottom or in the top by adjusting the emulsifier amount. This system was used to directly extract polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from liquid and solid foods, and the obtained DES-rich phase was easy to be collected for quantification. The method (LPME with HPLC-fluorescence detector) has linearity (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.9974), detection limits of 0.6-4.2\u00a0ng L<sup>-1</sup> for liquid foods and 0.05-0.35\u00a0ng\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> for solid foods, recoveries of 86.2-114.9%, and intra-day/inter-day RSDs below 6.6%. The method was applied to detect PAHs in real samples, and the PAHs residue was found in honey and five solid foods. The DT-LPME method is simple, fast, green and suitable for direct extraction of analytes from both liquid and solid samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
