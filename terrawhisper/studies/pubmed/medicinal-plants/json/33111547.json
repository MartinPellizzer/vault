Although various administration routes have been used in the application of 1.8-cineole, few formulations have been developed to improve its stability and bioavailability. This review retrospects the researches on the source, biological activities, mechanisms, and application of 1,8-cineole since 2000, which provides a view for the further studies on the application and formulations of 1,8-cineole."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School
