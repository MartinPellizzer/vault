However, no reports are available on skin and squamous lung carcinoma. Also, the complete mode of action is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, the anticancer potential of cirsimaritin is explored in organ-specific cell lines by using MTT assay. Further, the inhibitory potential and binding interaction with the selected targets were analyzed through <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in-silico</i> analysis. Cirsimaritin showed selective anticancer activity against NCIH-520 cell-line (IC<sub>50</sub> 23.29<b>\u2009</b>\u00b5M), also inhibited the proliferation of other cell-lines up to 48% at 100<b>\u2009</b>\u00b5M. In NCIH-520 cell-line, cirsimaritin significantly increased the apoptosis of the cells at both the tested concentrations (10 and 100<b>\u2009</b>\u00b5M), which was confirmed by Annexin-V signifying the induction of late apoptosis. Besides, an increase in the ROS levels of 1.6 fold (10<b>\u2009</b>\u00b5M) and 1.8 fold (100<b>\u2009</b>\u00b5M), circimaritin also inhibits the activity of ODC and CATD with the IC<sub>50</sub> 57.30 and 68.22<b>\u2009</b>\u00b5M respectively. It exhibited a good binding score with the selected targets, follow Lipinski's rule of five and non-mutagenic. Hence, cirsimaritin is a potent molecule, which inhibits the proliferation of lung squamous cell lines by inducing apoptosis. It also inhibited the activity of ODC and CATD responsible for the progression phase in the cancer cells. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
