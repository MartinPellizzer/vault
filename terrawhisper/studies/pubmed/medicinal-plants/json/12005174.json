In the present investigation, the ability of Pistafolia A to scavenge reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion was measured by ESR spin trapping technique. The inhibition effect on iron-induced lipid peroxidaiton in liposomes was studied. The protective effects of Pistafolia A against oxidative neuronal cell damage and apoptosis induced by peroxynitrite were also assessed. The results showed that Pistafolia A could scavenge both hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion dose-dependently and inhibit lipid peroxidation effectively. In cerebellar granule cells pretreated with Pistafolia A, peroxynitrite-induced oxidative neuronal damage and apoptosis were prevented markedly. The antioxidant capacity of Pistafolia A was much more potent then that of the water-soluble analog of vitamin E, Trolox. The results suggested that Pistafolia A might be used as an effective natural antioxidant for the prevention and cure of neuronal diseases associated with the production of peroxynitrite and related reactive oxygen species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biophysics, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chaoyang District, Beijing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Taotao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Handong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xingyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Jingwu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Aijun", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qinshi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Wenjuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pistafolia A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12005174", "10.1016/s0024-3205(02)01494-7", "S0024-3205(02)01494-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
