It highlights the significance of ophthalmic drug delivery due to the prevalence of eye diseases and delves into various aspects of this field. The article explores molecular mechanisms, drugs used, and physiological factors affecting drug absorption. It also addresses challenges in treating both anterior and posterior eye segments and investigates the role of mucus in obstructing micro- and nanosuspensions. Nanosuspensions are presented as a promising approach to enhance drug solubility and absorption, covering formulation, stability, properties, and functionalization. The review discusses the pros and cons of using nanosuspensions for ocular drug delivery and covers their structure, preparation, characterization, and applications. Several graphical representations illustrate their role in treating various eye conditions. Specific drug categories like anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, and more are discussed in detail, with relevant studies. The article also addresses current challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for improved nanosuspension stability and exploring potential technologies. Nanosuspensions have shown substantial potential in advancing ophthalmic drug delivery by enhancing solubility and absorption. This article is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical professionals in this field, offering insights into recent developments, challenges, and future prospects in nanosuspension use for ocular drug delivery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
