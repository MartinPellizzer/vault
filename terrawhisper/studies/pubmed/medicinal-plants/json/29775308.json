Pyracyclumines A, B, and H (1, 2, and 8) possess a novel 6/5/6/6 dimeric piperidine skeleton, a unique 6/5/6 dimeric piperidine skeleton, and a 1,4,6-triazaindan skeleton, respectively. Pyracyclumine C (3) is based on a rare cyclopentane-piperidine framework. The structures of the isolated compounds were established by analysis of their NMR and HRESIMS data. The racemic pyracyclumines A-E (1-5) were further separated by chiral HPLC to give the enantiomers (+)-1/(-)-1 to (+)-5/(-)-5, for which the absolute configurations were determined by comparison of their experimental and calculated ECD spectra. The plausible biogenetic pathways of these piperidine alkaloids were proposed starting from the basic units of compounds 12 and 13. All of the isolated compounds were tested for their inhibitory effects on menin-mixed lineage leukemia 1 protein-protein interaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6892-9401"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qi-Bin", "Initials": "QB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Guo-An", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Xue-Lei", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4652-6879"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Zone and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67I85E138Y", "NameOfSubstance": "piperidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B4914SW93T", "NameOfSubstance": "triazamate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29775308", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b00239"]}}]}
