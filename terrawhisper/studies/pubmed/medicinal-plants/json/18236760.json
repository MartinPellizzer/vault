The MCMVO was extracted by supercritical CO2, and its extraction rate was 3.4%. GC-MS was used to analyze volatile oil, the results suggested MCMVO contain thymol, carvacrol, P-cycmene, humulene etc. The thymol had the highest content accounts for 56.25%, and the carvacrol was 19.21%. The content of thymol and carvacrol of MCMVO extracted by organic solvent was 58.33% and 22.54%.", "the content of thymol and carvacrol extracted by organic solvent extraction method is higher than that extracted by supercritical CO2 extraction method.
