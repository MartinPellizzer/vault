The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods and the known compounds were identified by comparisons with the data reported in literature. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities and anti-HIV-1 activities. Compounds 1-8 exhibited significant inhibitory activities on nitric oxide (NO) production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values comparable to that of hydrocortisone. In addition, compounds 1-8 showed significant anti-HIV-1 activities with EC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 0.06 to 2.08\u202f\u00b5M. These findings suggest that the discoveries of these indole alkaloids with significant anti-inflammatory activities and anti-HIV-1 activities isolated from N. officinalis could be of great importance to the development of new anti-inflammatory and anti-HIV agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
