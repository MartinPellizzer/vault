However, the current knowledge of the factors influencing phytoremediation in pesticide-contaminated environments remains limited. It is critical to understand phytoremediation and the factors affecting the variation in removal efficiency. In this study, we compiled 72 previous research articles to quantify plant-induced improvements in removal efficiency and identify factors that influence variations in phytoremediation behavior through meta-analysis. We observed a significant increase in the removal efficiency of phytoremediation compared to the control group which did not involve phytoremediation. Pesticides significantly affect removal efficiency in terms of their modes of action, substance group, and properties. Plants demonstrated higher efficiency in remediating environments contaminated with pesticides possessing lower molecular masses and log K<sub>ow</sub> values. Plant species emerged as a crucial determinant of variations in removal efficiency. Annual plants exhibited a 1.45-fold higher removal efficiency than perennial plants. The removal efficiencies of different plant types decreased in the following order: agri-food crops > aquatic macrophytes > turfgrasses > medicinal plants > forage crops > woody trees. The Gramineae family, which was the most prevalent, demonstrated a robust and consistent phytoremediation ability. This study offers a more comprehensive triangular relationship between removal efficiency, pesticides, and plants, expanding the traditional linear model. Our findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of phytoremediation in pesticide-contaminated environments and the factors determining its success, ultimately guiding further research toward developing strategies for higher removal efficiency in phytoremediation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
