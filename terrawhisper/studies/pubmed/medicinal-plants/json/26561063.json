The reasons for autism are unclear, but various theories of genetics, immunity, biological, and psychosocial factors have been proffered. In fact, autism is a complex disorder with distinct causes that usually co-occur. Although no medicine has been recognized to treat this disorder, pharmacological treatments can be effective in reducing its signs, such as self-mutilation, aggression, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, inattention, hyperactivity, and sleeping disorders. Recently, complementary and alternative approaches have been considered to treat autism. Ginkgo biloba is one of the most effective plants with an old history of applications in neuropsychological disorders which recently is used for autism. The present review discusses the recent findings, pathophysiology, and etiology of autism and thereafter addresses the promising results of herbal remedies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bahmani", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarrafchi", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shirzad", "ForeName": "Hedayatollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran. rafieian@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Rafieian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "genetics", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Autistic Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Cognition Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroimmunomodulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Social Behavior Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26561063", "10.2174/1381612822666151112151529", "CPD-EPUB-71796"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
