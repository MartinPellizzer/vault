Since 1866, the plant has been recognized as a potential menses inducer. Pharmacological observations of zoapatle were made in Mexico in 1945 and focused on the administration of zoapatle aqueous crude extract (ZACE). Animal studies demonstrated increased uterine contractility. 9 compounds have been isolated from zoapatle. Much of the recent work with the material has been detailed in several patent applications. In 2 of 4 clinical studies on the use of ZACE, an increase in uterine contractility and cervical dilation among pregnant women was noted, and in another study, a cramping sensation was reported by nonpregnant women. The need to control for ecological variables which effect the plants seasonally was mentioned by 1 researcher who found working with the crude extract difficult and unpredictable. The lack of toxic effects was demonstrated in a study using animal models. Different effects were noted in a study which used zoapatanol obtained by total synthesis, including the lack of uterotonic response in rabbit tissue which warrants further investigation. The plant or its derivatives are potentially useful as interceptive agents but further research under controlled conditions is needed."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["014427", "00118710"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Biology", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Female", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--pharmacodynamics", "Research And Development", "Technology", "Urogenital System", "Uterine Effects", "Uterus"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6342937", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "07", "Day": "08"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "27", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "The zoapatle I--a traditional remedy from Mexico emerges to modern times.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "211", "EndPage": "225", "MedlinePgn": "211-25"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["A review of publications from 1529 to 1982 related to the zoapatle was made.
