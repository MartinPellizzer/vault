In the present study, we selected 127 common Chinese herbs. Association rules mining method was used to find out the association relationship between the cold-heat properties of different TCM and the habitats of their original plant, while using statistical methods to analyze the correlation between light condition and cold-heat property of TCM based on the description of the habitats in the Flora of China and investigation. The results showed that the habitats associated to TCM with cold property are in the order of grassland>curb>hillside>wasteland>gully>farmland>riverside. The habitats that associated to TCM with heat property are: undergrowth>shrub>gully>jungle. For 68 TCMs with cold property, 81.2% of their original plants are light-demanding, 8.7% are shade-demanding, and 8.7% of them showed no obvious light preference. For 59 TCMs with heat property, 62.7% of their original plants are shade-demanding, 20.3% are shade-demanding, and 17.0% of them showed no obvious light preference. Meanwhile, Chi-square test showed that there was a significant difference between the cold-heat property and light preference (<i>P</i><0.01). In summary, there is a significant correlation between the light preference of TCM original plants and their cold-heat properties. In order to ensure the pharmacological effect of TCM, the relationship between the light conditions and the properties of TCM should be considered in the cultivation of medicinal plants for TCM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hong-Zhuan", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lu", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Pan-Pan", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29933667", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2018.0066"]}}]}
