A \"multiple hit\" model has been a widely accepted explanation for the disease's complicated pathogenesis. Despite advances in our knowledge of the processes underlying NAFLD, no conventional pharmaceutical therapy exists. The only currently approved option is to make lifestyle modifications, such as dietary and physical activity changes. The use of medicinal plants in the treatment of NAFLD has recently gained interest. Thus, we review the current knowledge about these agents based on clinical and preclinical studies. Moreover, the association between NAFLD and colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most common and lethal malignancies, has recently emerged as a new study area. We overview the shared dysregulated pathways and the potential therapeutic effect of herbal medicines for CRC prevention in patients with NAFLD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers;
