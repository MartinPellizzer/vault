Rats were subjected to partial hepatectomy to stimulate hepatocellular proliferation required for initiation by DMH (50-200 mg/kg i.p.) given 12 h later. Initiation was assessed by the numbers of foci and nodules of hepatocytes that were positive for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) or glutathione-S-transferase-P (GST-P) after 6 weeks promotion by orotic acid (1% in semi-purified diet). DAS at doses above 50 mg/kg (by gavage) administered 1 h before DMH (50 mg/kg) partially reduced the numbers of gamma-GT and GST-P-positive foci. By comparison, all doses of DAS (25-100 mg/kg) completely prevented liver necrosis by DMH (200 mg/kg). DAS substantially reduced macromolecular binding of [14C]DMH in cultured liver cells, but had no effect on their levels of glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase or glutathione peroxidase at 18 h. These findings suggest that low dosages of DAS which reduce DMH binding appear more likely to inhibit hepatocarcinogenicity by reducing the promoting influences of post-necrotic regeneration than by preventing initiation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rushmore", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goldberg", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylhydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylhydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylhydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Methylhydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3608098", "10.1093/carcin/8.8.1155"]}}]}
