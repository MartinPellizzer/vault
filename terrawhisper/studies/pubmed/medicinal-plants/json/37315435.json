Researchers are increasingly interested in alternative medications or active components derived from natural sources. Naringenin is a commonly consumed flavonoid found in many plants, and since it was discovered to have nutritional benefits, it has been utilized to treat inflammation and infections caused by particular bacteria or viruses. However, the absence of adequate clinical data and naringenin's poor solubility and stability severely restrict its usage as a medicinal agent. In this article, we discuss naringenin's effects and mechanisms of action on autoimmune-induced inflammation, bacterial infections, and viral infections based on recent research. We also present a few suggestions for enhancing naringenin's solubility, stability, and bioavailability. This paper emphasizes the potential use of naringenin as an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective agent and the next prophylactic substance for the treatment of various inflammatory and infectious diseases, even though some mechanisms of action are still unclear, and offers some theoretical support for its clinical application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
