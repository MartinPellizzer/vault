This, together with its high degree of diversity suggests that subtype A is amongst the fittest HIV-1M lineages. Here we use a comprehensive set of published near full-length subtype A sequences and A-derived genome fragments from both circulating and unique recombinant forms (CRFs/URFs) to obtain some insights into how frequently these lineages have independently seeded HIV-1M sub-epidemics in different parts of the world. We do this by inferring when and where the major subtype A lineages and subtype A-derived CRFs originated. Following its origin in the CB during the 1940s, we track the diversification and recombination history of subtype A sequences before and during its dissemination throughout much of the world between the 1950s and 1970s. Collectively, the timings and numbers of detectable subtype A recombination and dissemination events, the present broad global distribution of the sub-epidemics that were seeded by these events, and the high prevalence of subtype A sequences within the regions where these sub-epidemics occurred, suggest that ancestral subtype A viruses (and particularly sub-subtype A1 ancestral viruses) may have been genetically predisposed to become major components of the present epidemic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5262-892X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (Krisp), School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4041, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Computational Biology, Department of Integrative Biomedical Sciences and Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town 7925, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Research for Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases (CREMER), Institute of Medical Research and Study of Medicinal Plants (IMPM), Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tongo", "ForeName": "Marcel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South African MRC Bioinformatics Unit, South African National Bioinformatics Institute, University of the Western Cape, Bellville 7535, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Harkins", "ForeName": "Gordon W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9938-8911"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town 7925, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology, School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2193, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Dorfman", "ForeName": "Jeffrey R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD 20910-7500, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henry M.
