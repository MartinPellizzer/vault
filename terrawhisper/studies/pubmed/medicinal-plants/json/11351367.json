The results revealed no -significant change in absolute body and organ weights in extract-fed animals, indicating no alteration in general metabolic status. Further, feeding had no effect on haematological and clinical biochemical tests reflecting its non-toxicity. Similarly, uterine and ovarian biochemical tests showed no change except in 3beta and 17beta hydroxy steroid dehydrgenase (HSDs) levels, probably affecting hormonal conversions in the latter. Cohabited females with normal male mice were unable to become pregnant as their cyclicity was affected. These factors are related to a change in the hormonal milieu that governs female reproductive function. Upon withdrawal of feeding for 45 days, these effects were reversible. Thus this extract manifests a definite contraceptive effect in female mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproductive Endocrinology and Toxicology Division, Zoology Department, School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad - 380009, India. zooldeptgu@satyam.net.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alice", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11351367", "10.1002/ptr.735", "10.1002/ptr.735"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
