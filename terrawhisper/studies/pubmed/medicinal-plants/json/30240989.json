This study investigated the effects of a salicylic acid (SA) pretreatment and different glucose levels on the growth, biochemical traits and taxane production in a Taxus baccata callus culture. For this purpose, after a pretreatment with SA (5\u202f\u03bcM), three-month-old calli were cultured on B5 medium fortified with different concentrations of glucose (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%), and they were compared with calli cultured on a B5 medium supplemented only with glucose. When the calli were harvested at 21 days, their fresh weight (g), dry weight (g) and cell viability (%) had decreased significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) with the higher glucose concentrations. The glucose treatment increased the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and caused oxidative stress in treated tissues. The lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and oxidative stress was associated with an increased antioxidant enzyme activity in the SA-pretreated samples, which resulted in less membrane damage and improved growth and cell viability under the glucose treatment compared to the control. By reducing the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), the SA pretreatment reduced the production and oxidation of phenolic compounds under the glucose treatment; this decrease was associated with less browning of tissues and higher viability. Increases in taxol (5.1-fold) and total taxanes (3.5-fold) in the SA-pretreated calli cultured on the medium containing 2% glucose, compared to the control, indicated that the two treatments had a significant effect on taxane production in the T. baccata callus culture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
