The quality of life is affected seriously, which further results in great social and family burden. Many drugs, from the century-old aspirin to the newly FDA-approved Byvalson, have been proven to be effective in the treatment and prevention of CVD. As clinically reported, those life-saving drugs still have their side effects in regards to the narrow therapeutic indexes influenced by individual genetic variations. Herba Leonuri, also known as Chinese Motherwort, which are naturally present in plants and traditionally are used for the uterotonic action, postpartum blood stasis, breast pain as well as other gynecological disorders in China for thousands of years. Since the last two decades, our group has reported leonurine, a unique alkaloid found in Herba Leonuri, exhibits various bioactivities such as antioxidant, anti-apoptotic effects, free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to improving micro-circulation. These bioactivities are related to the underlying mechanisms of ischemic heart diseases and cardiac fibrosis. Pharmacological studies have proven leonurine to be effective in treating CVD in various ways, particularly ischemic heart diseases. Besides the cardio protective effects, which are similar in the central nervous system, more specifically, inhibited mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production together with the restored mitochondrial function and redox state were observed in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats by leonurine treatment, which strongly reveals its neuroprotective effects and carries a therapeutic potential for recovery and prevention of stroke. Based on their mode of action, we propose that leonurine can be developed as drugs to treat ischemic heart diseases. Taking advantage of the most recent findings in pharmacological research including the effects of low toxicity and good pharmacokinetics characteristics, leonurine has a very attractive prospect of clinical application. Our recent promising pharmacological results may be able to eradicate the barrier hindering its sale on market. In sum, from bench to bedside is no longer a long way for leonurine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
