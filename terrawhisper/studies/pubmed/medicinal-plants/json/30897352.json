T.\u00a0antungense hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (TaHQT)1 and TaHQT2, which belong to the BAHD acyltransferase family, are candidates for synthesizing 5-caffeoylquinic acid and that have not been extensively characterized. In this study, we cloned the TaHQT1 and TaHQT2 genes and analysed the properties of the expressed enzymes both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that TaHQT1 was highly expressed in the root, whereas the strongest TaHQT2 expression was observed in T.\u00a0antungense leaves. In Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells, TaHQT1 and TaHQT2 were localized at the cell periphery as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The 5-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations in T.\u00a0antungense calli were reduced by TaHQT1 and TaHQT2 knockdown relative to the control. Conversely, inoculation of T.\u00a0antungense plants tissues with recombinant TaHQT1 and TaHQT2 increased 5-caffeoylquinic acid levels in situ. These in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo findings demonstrate that both HQTs are involved in regulating 5-caffeoylquinic acid biosynthesis in T.\u00a0antungense, which can be exploited to increase 5-caffeoylquinic acid production in plants for medicinal or other beneficial purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
