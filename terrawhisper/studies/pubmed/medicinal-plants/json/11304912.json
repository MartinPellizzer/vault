Index scores generated from the food frequency survey indicated that the mean levels of consumption for foods of animal origin (p < 0.001), total vegetables and fruit (p = 0.001), vegetables alone (p = 0.006), fruits alone (p = 0.006), and green leafy vegetables (p = 0.015) were significantly lower in cases than in controls. The mean index score for cobalamin (vitamin B12) was lower in cases with a borderline significance (p = 0.05), whereas the indexes for folate and carotene were not significantly different. The analysis of index scores estimating the number of 100-g servings per week of foods of animal origin [meat, eggs, milk, curd (yogurt), fish] consumed revealed that women who ate fewer servings were more likely to have premalignant lesions than those who ate more animal foods [odds ratio (OR) 3.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.07-5.54, p = 0.001]. The risk for low consumption of vegetables was not as significant as that for foods of animal origin. However, those eating low levels of vegetables and low levels of foods of animal origin were at the greatest risk for lesions (OR 5.38, 95% CI 1.72-22.17, p < 0.05). In South Indian female tobacco/betel chewers, a diet deficient in foods of animal origin appears to be a more significant risk factor for oral premalignancy than is a diet deficient in fruits and vegetables."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of International Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294-0008, USA."}], "LastName": "Carley", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Puttaiah", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alvarez", "ForeName": "J O", "Initials": "JO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heimburger", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anantha", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2S07RR-05829-10", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA-47888-05", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11304912", "10.1080/01635589409514333"]}}]}
