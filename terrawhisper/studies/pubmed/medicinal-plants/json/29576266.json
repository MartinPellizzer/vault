Four chromatographic parameters were optimized using CCD test, and a fusion index established by Derringer function was used to evaluate. The lipid profile of 27 batches of coix seeds were acquired and processed by Progenesis QI software, and the MS/MS spectrums were obtained to identify, simultaneously. The difference lipids were explored by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The lipids that showed differences depending on their seeds' geographical origin were selected as markers of the quality of coix seeds from the three regions.", "A Torus 2-PIC (1.7\u202f\u00b5m, 100\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.0\u202fmm) was selected as the optimal column of the untargeted method which the run time was only 8 minutes. From the CCD test, the interaction of chromatographic parameters between column temperature and backpressure was founded which the optimal parameters were 55\u202f\u00b0C and 2600\u202fpsi, respectively. Thirty-two peaks in the lipid profile of coix seed were tentatively identified, of which 20 were triglyceride, and 12 were diglyceride. Nine features that could potentially be used to distinguish the coix seeds by their geographical origin were identified, most of which were diglycerides, such as OP.", "Our findings confirm that UPC<sup>2</sup>-QTOF combined with chemometrics could be used as an efficient method for exploring potential lipid markers of the quality of herbal medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
