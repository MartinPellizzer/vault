These \u03b2CAs occurs in both plant and animal system including human being. In the present investigation, their best separation was achieved using an optimized mobile phase, chloroform: methanol: glacial acetic acid (7.8:2.2:0.2, v/v/v) on aluminum TLC plates precoated with silica gel 60 F254. The quantification was performed by densitometric scanning in fluorescence mode at 366 nm. The calibration curves were drawn using linear regression, plotted over the range 25-250 ng band-1 of standard \u03b2CAs with correlation coefficient (R2) between 0.97 and 0.992. Accuracy in terms of recovery (83.95-112.40%), repeatability of application (0.61-2.42%), repeatability of measurement (1.94-3.05%) and intermediate precision (0.62-11.16%) of developed method were simultaneously determined. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were between 4.95-6.59 and 16.50-21.93 ng band-1, respectively. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines and was simple, cost-effective, precise, sensitive and specific for the determination of \u03b2CAs in herbs, Fagonia schweinfurthii, Peganum harmala and Tribulus terrestris. The developed HPTLC method would have importance in forensic and industrial chromatographic analysis and fingerprinting of various herbs and drug formulations containing \u03b2CAs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
