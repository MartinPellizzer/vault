There were Syoujiou, Kanjiou and Zyukujiou etc. The first was introduced in the Sinnou-honzoukyou and the first and second had been used to prepare some prescriptions contained in the Kinki-youryaku and so on. The third began to appear on the medical and herbal literatures from the Tang period to the early Song. The Rehmanniae Radix has been used as the main material of Hokyoyouketu prescriptions, and by the use of Zyukujiou, their efficacy was regarded to be particularly stronger than the others. The preparation of Hatimigan recorded in the Kinki-youryaku had been used in Kanjiou but was later replaced with Zyukujiou. We should rethink about the quality and process of Chinese herbs on the pharmacy of Kampo medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kinki University, Osaka."}], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Asano", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11619111"]}}]}
