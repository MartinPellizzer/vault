Its sources are mainly derive from plants, some derive from animals and minerals, and a few derive from chemical drugs and biologic products. It was made up into a colossal complexed system because it's diversity of biological sources, ecological environments, chemical structures, processing methods, processes of metabolism and disposition in intra-body, biological activity and clinical use, and involved a lot of scientific problems. The elucidation of the effective and active constituents is a basic and scientific problem to clarify complexed system of Chinese material medica. Along with research progressing of processes of metabolism and disposition of Chinese material medica in intra-body and metabonomics, a new and rapid-developing technology, the discovery strategy for effective and active constituents of Chinese material medica based on the processes of metabolism and disposition would be made up, which will provide a new methodology and pathway to clarify of complexed system of Chinese material medica."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100083, China. xwyang@bjmu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Wei", "Initials": "XW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17511134"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
