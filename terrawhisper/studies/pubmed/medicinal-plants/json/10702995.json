Tryptamine (TRY) was the main biogenic amine detected, and its concentration considerably increased during the germination. beta-Phenylethylamine (PHE) was detected in small amounts and its concentration slowly increased during germination. The concentration of tyramine (TYR) showed a fluctuation pattern of changes during germination in all tested legumes. The concentrations of cadaverine (CAD) and putrescine (PUT) increased during the germination period in all tested grains. However, histamine (HIS) showed a fluctuated pattern of changes in both broad bean and lupine, and a gradual increase in chick pea. Spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) contents of broad bean and chick pea showed a fluctuation pattern of change, while, a decrement trend of change was recorded for lupine along the germination period. By cooking, legume samples became free of biogenic amines which appeared in the boiling water. Heat treatment seems to have little effect on the concentration of biogenic amines in legume sprouts. The amounts of biogenic amines detected in the boiling water are less than the initial amounts of the sprouts (expected amounts)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre, Food Technology and Dairy Science Department, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shalaby", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biogenic Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dansyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Biogenic Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dansyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pisum sativum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10702995", "10.1002/(SICI)1521-3803(20000101)44:1<23::AID-FOOD23>3.0.CO;2-B"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
