For the 1st time in its history the limiting factor in its growth has not been our ability to utilize resources, but rather a lack of the resources themselves. At the same time the largest problem to ever face our species, the loss of biodiversity, is threatening our own survival. Clearly we can not support our current numbers under the current consumptive system. All our food is provided by wild species that have been genetically manipulated to serve our ends. Of the 80,000 known edible plant species only about 200 are cultivated regularly and only 3 (corn, wheat, rice) function as staples. Many of our industrial resources come from natural sources. 40% of our pharmaceuticals come from wild sources. It is impossible to isolate ourselves from the Earth ecosystem. Soil microorganisms are but one example of our dependence upon nature. The rainforests also serve as our planets lungs, without them we will choke to death. Yet we continue to destroy them at an alarming rate. They account for only 7% of our land area, and they have already shrunk some 40%. In purely economic terms the wholesale destruction of the rainforests is bad business: in rubber and fruit, 2.5 acres of rainforest is worth $9000 annually compared to cow pasture ($2500) and logging ($1000). Of course with fruit and rubber the rainforest remains sustainable while cow pasture and logging mean the destruction of the rainforest."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["069663", "00207255"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ZPG REPORTER"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Animal Resources", "Critique", "Deforestation--cost", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developed Countries", "Ecology", "Economic Factors", "Environment", "Environmental Degradation", "Financial Activities", "Food Supply", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Natural Resources", "Needs", "North America", "Northern America", "Plants, Medicinal", "Resource Allocation", "United States"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12343498", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "05", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0199-0071", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "23", "Issue": "6", "PubDate": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "Dec"}}, "Title": "ZPG reporter", "ISOAbbreviation": "ZPG Report"}, "ArticleTitle": "Unraveling the tapestry of life.
