The large number of syndromes that have been associated with HTLV-I (60 to date), the existence of TSP/HAM cases associated with other retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus-2 [HIV-2], HTLV-II), the existence of many TSPs without HTLV-I, and the evidence of clear epidemiologic contradictions in TSP/HAM indicate that the etiopathogenesis of TSP/HAM is not yet clear. Tropical spastic paraparesis/HAM affects patients of all human ethnic groups, but usually in well localized and relatively isolated geographic regions where HTLV-I has been endemic for a long time. Environmental factors and geographic locations appear to be critical factors. Because the neuropathology of TSP/HAM suggests a toxometabolic, rather than a viral cause, it is proposed that an intoxication similar to neurolathyrism could account for some of TSP/HAM cases, mainly in tropical and subtropical countries. If this were the case, HTLV-I could be a cofactor or act as a bystander. it is possible that co-infection with another agent is necessary to produce TSP/HAM and most of the syndromes associated with HTLV-I."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emeritus Professor, Clinical Neurology, School of Medicine, Valle University, Cali, Colombia. vlazani@mafalda.univalle.edu.co"}], "LastName": "Zaninovic", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Int J Infect Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9610933", "ISSNLinking": "1201-9712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Transfusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Human T-lymphotropic virus 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "immunology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retroviridae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Spinal Cord"}], "NumberOfReferences": "121"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10460931", "10.1016/s1201-9712(99)90041-3", "S1201-9712(99)90041-3"]}}]}
