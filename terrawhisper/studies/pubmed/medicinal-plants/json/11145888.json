Previously, analysis of RNA3 cDNA clones constructed from cowpea-adapted mutants derived from CCMV(B3a) revealed that a single codon change in the B3a gene allowed CCMV(B3a) to infect cowpea systemically. In this study, to extend the analysis of the CCMV(B3a) adaptation mechanism, we directly sequenced B3a gene RT-PCR products prepared from 28 cowpea plants in which cowpea-adapted mutants appeared, and found seven patterns of a codon change localized at five specific positions in the central region (Ser(118), Glu(132), Glu(138), Gln(178), and Ser(180)). All of the patterns involved an amino acid change to Lys or Arg. Mutational analysis of the B3a gene demonstrated that a single codon change resulting in either Lys or Arg at any of the five positions was sufficient for the adaptation of CCMV(B3a) to cowpea. In contrast, CCMV(B3a) variants with a codon change resulting in Lys or Arg at three other positions (137, 155, and 161) in the B3a gene not only showed lack of systemic infection of cowpea but also showed weakened initial cell-to-cell movement in the inoculated leaves and diminished B3a accumulation in protoplasts. These results suggest that adaptive changes in the B3a gene are site-specifically selected in cowpea plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Pathology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto, 606-8502, Japan. chaki@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujita", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mise", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Furusawa", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94ZLA3W45F", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K3Z4F929H6", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Substitution"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Arginine"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bromovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lysine"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11145888", "10.1006/viro.2000.0518", "S0042-6822(00)90518-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
