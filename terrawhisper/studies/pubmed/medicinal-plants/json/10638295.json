However, diarrhoea and poor growth performance have been reported, due to the various anti-nutritional factors they contain. This study addressed in particular whether dietary cowpea impaired the growth of pigs, whether the small intestinal Na+/D-glucose coabsorptive transport capacity was decreased, whether the Cl- secretory capacity was increased, and, finally, whether these parameters were affected by heat treatment of cowpea. Pigs, 4 weeks old, were fed for 3 weeks with one of three diets: (i) standard soy, (ii) 75% of soy substituted with raw cowpea, or (iii) 75% of soy substituted with heat-treated cowpea. The absorptive and secretory capacities of the jejunum and ileum were measured with the Ussing chamber technique. Weight gain, feed intake, pancreatic protein and enzyme concentrations and levels of the blood hormones glucagon and cholecystokinin were also measured. The Na+ transport capacity was measured as the increase in short-circuit current (Isc) when D-glucose was added to the luminal side in the Ussing chambers. Isc was significantly higher in the jejunum from raw cowpea-fed pigs than in the jejunum from standard soy-fed pigs, with no difference between the two cowpea-fed groups. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline was subsequently added bilaterally, and the increase in Isc indicated the cAMP-depedent Cl- secretory capacity. In the jejunum this was significantly higher in raw and heat-treated cowpea-fed pigs than in standard soy-fed pigs. In contrast, there were no differences in the ileal transport capacities. There were no differences in the pancreatic protein and trypsin concentrations or the blood hormones, but the raw cowpea-fed pigs had significantly lower pancreatic amylase than standard soy-fed pigs. Weight gain and feed intake were lowest in the cowpea-fed groups, with no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, the hypothesis of impaired small intestinal absorption of D-glucose and Na+ as causing malabsorption, and therefore impaired growth, during cowpea substitution in the feed may be firmly rejected. The increased Cl- secretory capacity, although moderate, may contribute to the higher incidence of post-weaning diarrhoea in cowpea-fed pigs, as observed in other studies. Additionally, the decreased food intake, feed conversion and weight gain were unaffected by heat treatment, further suggesting involvement of heat-stable anti-nutritional factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Physiology, The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Frederiksberg, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Erlwanger", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Unmack", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gr\u00f8ndahl", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pierzynowski", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aalbaek", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dantzer", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skadhauge", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zentralbl Veterinarmed A", "NlmUniqueID": "0331323", "ISSNLinking": "0514-7158"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Motility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10638295", "10.1046/j.1439-0442.1999.00236.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
