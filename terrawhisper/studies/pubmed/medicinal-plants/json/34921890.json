The glycoprotein and polysaccharide fractions showing high cytotoxicity towards several human and animal cancer cell lines: A549, Hep-2, HeLa, \u04216 and SPEV-2 were isolated from basidiomycete Lentinus edodes vegetative mycelium and fruiting body and further characterized. It was found that water-soluble glycoprotein fractions caused the most significant, 70-100% inhibition of metabolic activity of SP\u0415V-2, \u0410549 and \u04216 cell lines. The effective concentrations of glycoprotein fractions reducing the viability of cancer cell lines were determined. The protein and subunit composition of fractions was studied; the highly active galactose-specific lectins were found to be present in these fractions. Comparative analysis of transcriptomes of L. edodes vegetative mycelium, fruiting body and primordium revealed the presence of carbohydrate-binding glycoproteins (lectins) specific for each stage of basidiomycete morphogenesis. Histological examination revealed some morphological indicators of immune system activation and the absence of toxic effect on gastro-intestinal mucosa of animals at peroral administration of fungal glycoprotein fractions. Fungal protein and, in particular, lectin preparations derived from L. \u0435dodes vegetative mycelium might be considered as novel prospective tools in cancer diagnostics and therapies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
