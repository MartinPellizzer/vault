Increased lipid peroxidation and alterations in circulating antioxidants were observed in the diabetic state. The levels of glutathione, ascorbic acid and beta-carotene in blood were significantly lowered and alpha-tocopherol content was increased. Supplementation of fenugreek seeds in the diet lowered lipid peroxidation. The contents of glutathione and beta-carotene were increased and the alpha-tocopherol content was lowered. The level of ascorbic acid was unaltered. The level of antioxidants were higher in normal rats which were fed with the fenugreek supplemented diet compared with control animals which were fed commercial rat chow. The study shows that disrupted free radical metabolism in diabetic animals may be normalized by fenugreek seed supplementation in the diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ravikumar", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anuradha", "ForeName": "C V", "Initials": "CV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycated Hemoglobin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "68990-15-8", "NameOfSubstance": "fenugreek seed meal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SW5YHA5NG", "NameOfSubstance": "Alloxan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alloxan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trigonella"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10353156", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1573(199905)13:3<197::AID-PTR413>3.0.CO;2-L"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
