Thirty-seven medicinal plants have been identified, phytochemical components catalogued through literature research, and potential pharmacological activities correlated with Hmong medicinal uses. Using western biomedical criteria of efficacy, 92% of the medicinal plants being cultivated were found to be potentially efficacious. The frequent use of these plants in diet (81%) suggests that they have served to mediate against illness and disease states in the cultural and natural environment in which the practices evolved. A listing of 37 plants with Hmong names, uses and potentially active constituents is provided."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Minnesota, Department of Anthropology, Minneapolis 55455."}], "LastName": "Spring", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Laos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minnesota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "82"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2664357", "10.1016/0378-8741(89)90114-1", "0378-8741(89)90114-1"]}}]}
