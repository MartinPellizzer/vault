The quality control of 20 plant extracts which have reasonably good sales in USA market was compared and analyzed. The analysis of the quality control of six plant extracts indicated that there were two main reasons leading to the varied quality specifications among different suppliers. One reason was that the plant species utilized by different companies were different. The other reason was that the extraction processes were different among different production plants. Comparing with the significant international suppliers of plant extracts, the product quality of Chinese companies were not satisfactory. It was suggested that chromatography and chromatographic fingerprint techniques should be applied to improve the quality control standard of plant extract in our country."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The College of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Yun-dong", "Initials": "YD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wen-yuan", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Hong-Quan", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tie-jun", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proanthocyanidins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vaccinium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15620173"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
