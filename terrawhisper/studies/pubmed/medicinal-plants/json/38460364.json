This study delved into the pharmacological mechanism of DEN on hepatic lipotoxicity associated with Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In vivo study experiments on db/db mice indicated that DEN treatment notably enhanced liver function, decreased blood lipid levels, and improved insulin sensitivity. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that DEN significantly ameliorated metabolism pathways, including lipoic acid, linoleic acid, bile secretion, and the alanine/aspartate/glutamate metabolism, as well as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. Transcriptomics analysis demonstrated DEN treatment could modulate the expression of genes such as Cpt1b, Scd1, G6pc2, Fos, Adrb2, Atp2a1, Ppp1r1b, and Cyp7a1. Furthermore, Proteomics analysis indicated that the beneficial effect of DEN on lipid metabolism was linked to pathways like AMPK and PPAR signaling. The integrative analysis of multi-omics revealed that the PPAR-RXR signaling was critical to the therapeutic effect of DEN on T2DM-induced fatty liver. Additionally, in vitro study on AML-12 cells confirmed that DEN counteract PA-induced lipid accumulation by activating the PPAR-RXR pathway. Overall, these findings suggested that DEN exhibited the potential to mitigate T2DM-induced hepatic lipo-toxicity and manage lipid imbalances in T2DM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
