Skin is constantly exposed to infections, injuries, scratches, and burns. Wound dressings are commonly utilized for the treatment of wound site and protect it from external contamination. The biological importance of natural agents, such as herbal medicines and their derivations including extracts, essential oils and active compounds in the wound healing process has attracted the attention of researchers and also some manufacturers of wound dressings. Such natural agents improve wound healing by their antioxidant and antibacterial properties. This novel review article was conducted to evaluate the effects of medicinal plants and their derivations on inflammatory responses in surgical wound infection. <b>Methods:</b> The data were collected from various databases using specific keywords. <b>Results:</b> The results revealed that different medicinal plants and their derivations decrease the inflammation in the wound healing process by modulating in gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> Active compounds of medicinal plants can alleviate inflammation in the wound healing process, which must be taken into consideration in pharmaceutical industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["201591"], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia Branch, Islamic Azad University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Raei Abbasabadi", "ForeName": "Omidreza", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8631-071X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["201591"], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia Branch, Islamic Azad University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farahpour", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Low Extrem Wounds", "NlmUniqueID": "101128359", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7346"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38073147", "10.1177/15347346231212331"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
