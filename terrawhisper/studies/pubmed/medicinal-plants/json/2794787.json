Rats fed a bean diet for 10-12 days had increased biliary cholesterol output and molar percentage by 300% and 200%, respectively, compared to rats fed an isocaloric and isoprotein casein diet. Biliary phospholipid output increased 180%. Bile flow and biliary bile salt output remained in the normal range. Total serum and VLDL cholesterol concentration significantly decreased 27% and 50%, respectively, in the rats fed the bean diet. Hepatic cholesterogenesis was increased 170% in the bean-fed animals. The relative contribution of newly synthesized hepatic cholesterol to total biliary cholesterol increased 200%, and that of endogenous origin only 50%. These results suggested that newly synthesized hepatic cholesterol was preferentially channelled to the biliary cholesterol secretory pathway in bean-fed rats. Although hepatic cholesteryl ester concentration increased 240%, the incorporation of [14C]oleate into hepatic cholesteryl esters was significantly decreased by 30% in isolated hepatocytes of bean-fed animals. These results were consistent with the possibility that the availability of hepatic free cholesterol for biliary secretion was increased in the bean-fed animals. This study demonstrates that bean intake has a profound effect on the metabolic channelling and compartmentalization of hepatic cholesterol, resulting in a significant decrease in total serum and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and a high biliary cholesterol output."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Gastroenterolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile."}], "LastName": "Rigotti", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marzolo", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ulloa", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nervi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Lipid Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376606", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol Esters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2794787", "S0022-2275(20)38291-2"]}}]}
