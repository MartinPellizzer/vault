The structures of them were elucidated using NMR and HRESIMS data analysis. The relative configurations of the isolates were confirmed by NOE correlations and NMR calculation. The absolute configurations of them were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis and ECD calculation. Anti-vitiligo, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxicity of the isolates were tested. Acetyl feselol, feselol, ferusingensine I and farnesiferol A significantly increased the melanin content at the concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM. (17'E) - 9'\u03b1, 12'\u03b2 - isomarcandin exhibited strong cytotoxicity against HT-29 cell line with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47\u00a0\u03bcM, and (17'E) - isomarcandin demonstrated strong cytotoxicity against Hela, A549 and HT-29 cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 5.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25, 4.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20, and 4.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.
