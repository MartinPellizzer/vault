When seeds were surface disinfected, molds were detected in 73% of the seeds whereas 81% of the seed that was not disinfected produced molds. Aspergillus spp. were most frequently present while Penicillium spp. occurred in seed of 4 varieties and in less than 4% of the seed. Twelve isolates of A. flavus and A. parasiticus were examined for their ability to produce aflatoxins. Whether aflatoxins were produced and the amount of each varied according to the origin of the isolate and the species of Aspergillus. For example all A. flavus isolates produced at least 2 aflatoxins whereas 4 of the A. parasiticus isolates were nontoxigenic. When ground seeds of winged beans were inoculated with an aflatoxigenic strain of A. parasiticus the level of aflatoxins that occurred varied with the variety. All of the varieties supported greater aflatoxin production than peanuts and 6 of the 12 winged bean varieties gave higher levels of aflatoxins than rice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bean", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fernando", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mycopathologia", "NlmUniqueID": "7505689", "ISSNLinking": "0301-486X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mycotoxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Mycotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Appl Microbiol. 1975 Apr;29(4):522-6", "ArticleIdList": ["1168442"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1962 Sep 15;195:1062-3", "ArticleIdList": ["14479064"]}, {"Citation": "J Assoc Off Anal Chem. 1976 May;59(3):662-5", "ArticleIdList": ["944693"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3083261", "10.1007/BF00437006"]}}]}
