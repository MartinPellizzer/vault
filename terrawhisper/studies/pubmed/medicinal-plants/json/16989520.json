This method was also shown to be applicable for rapid and precise on-line identification of secondary metabolites present in commercial herbal products of H. procumbens. A total of 15 compounds (1-14 and 17) were identified from the ethanol and petroleum ether extracts, including a novel Diels-Alder dimer 14. Optimization of the HPLC-SPE-NMR experiments included quantitative (1)H NMR measurements, determination of trapping and elution efficiency, effect of multiple trapping of analytes, use of various deuterated solvents for SPE cartridge elution, and effect of post-column dilution ratio of eluent with water. Linear accumulation of apolar and relatively polar analytes was demonstrated for at least 8-10 repeated trappings, resulting in greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios in NMR spectra and reduced acquisition times. Thus, the HPLC-SPE-NMR technique provides an efficient means of identification of multiple components of crude extracts. By allowing on-line generation of high-quality 2D NMR data without traditional purification of extract components, the HPLC-SPE-NMR methodology represents a paradigm shift in natural products research with respect to structure elucidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, The Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universitetsparken 2, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clarkson", "ForeName": "Cailean", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Staerk", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "Steen Honor\u00e9", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Peter J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaroszewski", "ForeName": "Jerzy W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Harpagophytum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16989520", "10.1021/np0601612"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
