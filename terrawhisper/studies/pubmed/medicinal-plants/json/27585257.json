In the present work, antimicrobial activities various extracts of Tordylium persicum Boiss. & Hausskn aerial parts were determined against five Gram-positive bacteria, five Gram-negative bacteria, two fungi, and Echinococcus granulosus. Antimicrobial activities were assayed using both disk diffusion and microbroth dilution methods. Scolicidal activity was assayed by the Smyth and Barrett method. Also total phenol and total flavonoid contents for plant extracts were assayed. Results showed that the methanolic extract was more effective on all microbes. The results showed that Streptococcus pyogenes was the most susceptible to the methanolic extract (MIC = 25.9 \u00b1 0.0 \u00b5g/mL), while Proteus vulgaris was the most resistant strain (MIC = 295.3 \u00b1 0.0 \u00b5g/mL) among all bacteria evaluated. The extracts showed significant activity versus E. granulosus (P < 0.5) with dose-dependent inhibitions of the protoscolices. The high concentration of total polyphenolics (294.5 \u00b1 0.1 GAE/g DW) and flavonoids (105.7 \u00b1 0.3 mg CE/g DW) may be responsible for these activities. Our study is first evaluation on antimicrobial and scolicidal activities of T. persicum. Due to the appearance of antibiotic-resistance, ourstudy suggested that methanol extracts of this plant are appropriate candidate for traditional curative uses and it can be utilized in the pediatric infectious disease therapy, especially pediatric infectious disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zabol University of Medical Sciences Zabol Medicinal Plants Research Center Zabol Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Pediatric Infections Research Center, Mofid Children Hospital Tehran Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallah", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Alabama in Huntsville Department of Chemistry Huntsville USA."}], "LastName": "Setzer", "ForeName": "W N", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zabol University of Medical Sciences Zabol Medicinal Plants Research Center Zabol Iran."}], "LastName": "Entezari Heravi", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zabol University of Medical Sciences Zabol Iran mehdi_sharifirad@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27585257"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
