This work was devoted to determine chemical composition and antimicrobial properties of the EO of <i>M. piperita</i> harvested in the garden of the National Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of Morocco. Experiments have been conducted at the Microbial Biotechnology Laboratory at the Sciences and Technology Faculty, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco. <i>M. piperita</i> oil was screened for its antimicrobial activity against seven bacteria and two fungi using broth microdilution method. Chemical EO analysis was performed using CPG/MS. The EO revealed menthol (46.32%), menthofuran (13.18%), menthyl acetate (12.10%), menthone (7.42%), and 1,8-cineole (6.06%) as the main constituents. The tested EO exhibited strong inhibitory effect against all tested microorganisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.062% to 0.5% (v/v), except for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> that was the least sensitive and was only inhibited by concentrations as high as 0.5% (v/v). The studied EO showed an antimicrobial potential. This reinforces its use as an alternative to chemical additives that can be applied to the food and drug industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology Sa\u00efss, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Marwa", "ForeName": "Chraibi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology Sa\u00efss, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Fikri-Benbrahim", "ForeName": "Kawtar", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology Sa\u00efss, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Ou-Yahia", "ForeName": "Douae", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology Sa\u00efss, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Farah", "ForeName": "Abdellah", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Pharm Technol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101537797", "ISSNLinking": "0976-2094"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "El Amri J, Elbadaoui K, Zair T, Bouharb H, Chakir S, Alaoui TI.
