Several anticancer agents contain quinone structures as critical parts to show remarkable potential and distinctive modes of actions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the structure-activity relationships of microbial quinones and their derivatives as anticancer agents. A series of p-terphenylquinone and seriniquinone derivatives were therefore prepared. Treatment of the synthesized quinones possessed antiproliferative activity on human leukemia HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, seriniquinone derivatives elevated cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby triggering the ensuing apoptotic events. Our findings emphasize the excellent potential of seriniquinone derivatives as redox cycling-induced ROS-modulating anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
