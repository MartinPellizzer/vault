A hit rate of 65% was achieved, with the highest inhibition (97%) obtained by Adenopodia spicata leaves. A further seven plants exhibited an inhibition greater than 70% and five more over 50%. The leaves of the plants showed the greatest levels of inhibition. There was little difference in the overall hit rate between ethanolic and aqueous extracts, although in most cases there was a marked difference in activity between aqueous and ethanolic extracts from the same species. Plants exhibiting inhibition levels greater than 50% were further tested for the presence of tannins in order to eliminate possible false positives. Active plants that did not contain tannins were Agapanthus africanus, Agave americana, Clausena anisata, Dietes iridioides, Mesembruanthemum spp., Stangeria eriopus and Tulbaghia violacea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natal University Research Unit for Plant Growth and Development, Department of Botany, University of Natal Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duncan", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "J\u00e4ger", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Staden", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "False Positive Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10624863", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00097-5", "S0378-8741(99)00097-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
