The cohesiveness of this interaction was assessed by examining the autonomy of each RNA in viral replication, coat protein expression and systemic invasion. Using a pea protoplast system, in vitro transcripts of RNA1 were found to be capable of initiating RNA2-independent replication, including the formation of the distinctive nuclear membrane-based replication complex associated with wild-type PEMV infection. Western blotting and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the synthesis of the RNA1-encoded coat protein, as well as virion assembly, was also independent of RNA2-directed functions. Mechanical inoculations with transcripts of RNA1 failed to establish a systemic RNA1 infection, whereas inoculations with RNA2 were able to establish a largely asymptomatic systemic infection. Combined inoculum containing RNA1 and RNA2 transcripts were able to recreate wild-type PEMV symptomatology, demonstrating the dependence of RNA1 on RNA2 for mechanical passage. With the notable exception of the adaptation of PEMV to establish a true systemic invasion, these data further strengthen the analogy between PEMV and the helper-dependent complexes associated with members of the luteovirus group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1312."}], "LastName": "Demler", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Borkhsenious", "ForeName": "O N", "Initials": "ON"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rucker", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Zoeten", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["U03563"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Helper Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Luteovirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "pathogenicity", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Protoplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8176385", "10.1099/0022-1317-75-5-997"]}}]}
