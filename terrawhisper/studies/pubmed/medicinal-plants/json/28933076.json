Here, this paper reviewed recent advance in this field and put forward strategies to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of natural products. Firstly, a proposed biosynthetic pathway should be set up based on well-known knowledge about chemical reactions and information on the identified compounds, as well as studies with isotope tracer. Secondly, candidate genes possibly involved in the biosynthetic pathway were screened out by co-expression analysis and/or gene cluster mining. Lastly, all the candidate genes were heterologously expressed in the host and then the enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway was characterized by activity assay. Sometimes, the function of the enzyme in the original plant could be further studied by RNAi or VIGS technology. Understanding the biosynthetic pathways of natural products will contribute to supply of new leading compounds by synthetic biology and provide \"functional marker\" for herbal molecular breeding, thus but boosting the development of traditional Chinese medicine agriculture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Li-Qiu", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Xue-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multigene Family"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synthetic Biology"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933076", "10.4268/cjcmm20162206"]}}]}
