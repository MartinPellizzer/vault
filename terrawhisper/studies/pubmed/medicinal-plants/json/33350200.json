AP2/ERF transcription factors are widely involved in a variety of physiological processes in plants, including plant development, fruit ripening, flower development and other plant development processes, as well as such stress response processes as damage, pathogen defense, high-salt condition and drought. In recent years, secondary metabolic engineering that takes transcription factors as genetic manipulation targets has developed rapidly in improving the content of active ingredients and the quality of medicinal plants. This paper reviews the recent progress in the regulation of secondary metabolites biosynthesis with AP2/ERF transcription factors, and provides theoretical basis for the exploration of efficient regulatory targets, the regulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants, the targeted improvement of the content of active ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, and the sustainable supply of high-quality traditional Chinese medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Rui-Bing", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "W U", "Initials": "WU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University Shanghai 200433, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factor AP-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factor AP-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350200", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200804.602"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
