Panax ginseng Meyer (P. ginseng) has been widely used as a therapeutic herbal medicine for a long time in cancer treatment. In this study, the cytotoxic and oxidative effect of a novel silver nanoparticles synthesized from P. ginseng fresh leaves (P.g AgNPs) were evaluated in different human cancer cell lines. In addition, the effect of P.g AgNPs on cell migration, apoptosis and the determination of the mechanism involve was determinate by the use of A549 lung cancer cell line. It was found that P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited cell viability and induced oxidative stress in A549, MCF7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines. Likewise, P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced migration, as well as decreased the mRNA levels and phosphorylation of EGF receptors in A549 cells. Moreover, P.g AgNPs modified the morphology of the cell nucleus and increase apoptosis percentage; this effect was linked to the stimulation of p38 MAPK/p53 pathway. Taken together, our results showed that P.g AgNPs exhibited anti-cancer activity in A549 and the regulation of EGFR/p38 MAPK/p53 pathway might be the possible mechanism of its anti-activity. Further experiments are suggested to determinate the mechanism by which P.g AgNPs induce cytotoxicity and ROS generation in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
