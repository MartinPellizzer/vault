This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the chimeric protein against BC cells in vitro and in vivo. We developed a novel multifunctional protein, consisting of p28, as a tumor-homing killer peptide fused to apoptin as a tumor-selective killer. The chimeric protein showed significantly higher toxicity in BC cell lines dose-dependently than in non-cancerous control cell lines. IC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.41, 1.38, 6.13, and 264.49\u2009\u03bcM for 4T1, MDA-MB-468, Vero, and HEK293 cells, respectively. The protein showed significantly enhanced uptake in 4T1 cancer cells compared with non-cancerous Vero cells. We also showed that the p28-apoptin chimeric protein binds significantly higher to human breast cancer tumor sections than the normal human breast tissue section. Also, significant apoptosis induction and tumor growth inhibition were observed in established tumor-bearing mice accompanied by a decreased frequency of metastases. Our results support that the chimeric protein has inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo, making it a promising choice in targeted cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hazrati", "ForeName": "Fereshte", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saidijam", "ForeName": "Massoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadyousefi", "ForeName": "Yaghoub", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nouri", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghadimipour", "ForeName": "Hamidreza", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradi", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology Toxicology, School of Pharmacy Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Haddadi", "ForeName": "Rasool", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2505-8834"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soleimani", "ForeName": "Meysam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proteins", "NlmUniqueID": "8700181", "ISSNLinking": "0887-3585"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HEK293 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "DeSantis CE, Ma J, Gaudet MM, et al.
