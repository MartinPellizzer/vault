Particularly in agriculture, <i>Penicillium</i> species significantly impact plants, causing diseases and contamination that adversely affect crop yields and quality. Timely detection of <i>Penicillium</i> species is crucial for controlling disease and preventing mycotoxins from entering the food chain. To tackle this issue, we implement a novel species identification approach called Analysis of whole GEnome (AGE). Here, we initially applied bioinformatics analysis to construct specific target sequence libraries from the whole genomes of seven <i>Penicillium</i> species with significant economic impact: <i>P. canescens</i>, <i>P. citrinum</i>, <i>P. oxalicum</i>, <i>P. polonicum</i>, <i>P. paneum</i>, <i>P. rubens</i>, and <i>P. roqueforti</i>. We successfully identified seven <i>Penicillium</i> species using the target we screened combined with Sanger sequencing and CRISPR-Cas12a technologies. Notably, based on CRISPR-Cas12a technology, AGE can achieve rapid and accurate identification of genomic DNA samples at a concentration as low as 0.01 ng/\u00b5L within 30 min. This method features high sensitivity and portability, making it suitable for on-site detection. This robust molecular approach provides precise fungal species identification with broad implications for agricultural control, industrial production, clinical diagnostics, and food safety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0009-3110-3487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yuanhao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life and Science, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Lianguo", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Yutong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Guihong", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Lijun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Tianyi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Resources Conservation, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China, Engineering Research Center of Chinese Medicine Resource, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jingyuan", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2022-I2M-2-001", "Agency": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101092791", "ISSNLinking": "1422-0067"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CRISPR-Cas Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Whole Genome Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "economics"], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39125741", "10.3390/ijms25158172", "ijms25158172"]}}]}
