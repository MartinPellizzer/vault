This pilot randomized study was conducted at the service for menopause disorders of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.", "Ninety women in menopausal transition who attended our service with menopausal symptoms were enrolled in the study. Sixty patients, randomly assigned to the treatment group, were prescribed one daily tablet of a combined nutraceutical compound with phytoestrogen substances, vitamins, micronutrients and passion flower herbal medicine for 6\u00a0months. Thirty patients did not receive any treatment and comprised the control group. The intensity of perimenopausal symptoms was assessed by the modified Kuppermann Index (KI) at enrollment and at 3 and 6\u00a0months of treatment. At baseline and at the end of the study, patients underwent a clinical evaluation, a pelvic ultrasound and analysis of blood samples.", "In the nutraceutical supplemented group, a significant reduction in menopausal symptoms was demonstrated according to the KI after 3 and 6\u00a0months of supplementation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The within-group analysis of different KI parameters in the treated group showed a significant improvement in hot flushes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), insomnia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), fatigue (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and irritability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Metabolic parameters did not change significantly in the nutraceutical supplemented group.
