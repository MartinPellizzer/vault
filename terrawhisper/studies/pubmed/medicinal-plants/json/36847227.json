As a result, medicinal herbs are beginning to play a substantial role in the advancement of the dominant therapeutic medications. Since ancient times, the use of herbs has performed a vital part in human well-being as well in the invention of cutting-edge pharmaceuticals. Inflammation and related illnesses are a major health concern for the entire human population. Pain-inducing drugs including opiates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and corticosteroids have severe side effects and these therapies suffer from the recurrence of symptoms too after discontinuing the treatment. As a result, the diagnosis along with the advancement of medications with anti-inflammatory properties is the priority to conquer the drawbacks of the existing therapies. The present review article provides insight into the literature comprising promising phytochemicals from various medicinal plants tested through different model systems and employed for alleviating inflammation in several inflammatory disorders as well as clinical status of the herbal products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Madhukar", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Abhinav", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Bansal", "ForeName": "Shivam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Grover", "ForeName": "Rupanshi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Tanya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Sapna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Goyal", "ForeName": "Anju", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Bhatia", "ForeName": "Shiveena", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Vaid", "ForeName": "Lavish", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Guru Gobind Singh College of Pharmacy, Yamuna Nagar, 135001, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Deswal", "ForeName": "Geeta", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Guru Gobind Singh College of Pharmacy, Yamuna Nagar, 135001, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Grewal", "ForeName": "Ajmer Singh", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Recent Adv Inflamm Allergy Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101776469", "ISSNLinking": "2772-2708"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36847227", "10.2174/2772270817666230227140659", "RAIAD-EPUB-129837"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
