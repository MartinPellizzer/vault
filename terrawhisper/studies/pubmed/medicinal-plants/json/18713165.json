Spondylolisthesis is one of the causes of lower back or neck pain. To our knowledge, successful treatment of symptomatic spondylolisthesis with medicinal herbs has not been previously reported in the published work. A 63-year-old female had suffered from back pain for 4 years. Radiographs revealed spondylolisthesis at the L3 level. In another case, an 82-year-old female suffered from neck pain. X-ray examinations revealed cervical spondylolisthesis at the C4 level. Several herbs were administered to these patients with symptomatic spondylolisthesis according to the guidelines for herbal medicine. Significant improvements in pain were obtained within 4 weeks in both patients. The pain completely disappeared after 20 weeks (case 1) and 6 weeks (case 2) of treatment. Although surgical treatment is often performed for symptomatic spondylolisthesis, the findings of the present cases imply the therapeutic potential of herbal medicine in selected patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kagetsu Clinic Shintotsugawa, Hokkaido, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsuji", "ForeName": "Kazuyuki", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koizumi", "ForeName": "Hideki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okabe", "ForeName": "Tetsuro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Geriatr Gerontol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "101135738", "ISSNLinking": "1447-0594"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neck Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnostic imaging", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Spondylolisthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18713165", "10.1111/j.1447-0594.2008.00458.x", "GGI458"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
