Loc ex Z. Wei & Pedley, Callerya nitida var. hirsutissima (Z. Wei) X.Y. Zhu, and Callerya nitida (Bentham) R. Geesink, which belongs to the Leguminosae family, are important medicinal plants in China. The genus Callerya includes 26 species, 18 species are distributed in China, and the vine stems of some species are used as traditional medicinal herbs because they have important pharmacological activity. Due to the high similarity of appearance, it is difficult to identify them in the market by appearance alone. Therefore, circulating of Callerya-related materia medica on the market is confusing, sometimes even leading to drug safety problems. It is urgent to develop molecular methods for their identification.", "To sequence and analyze the complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of C. reticulata, C. dielsiana, C. nitida var. hirsutissima, and C. nitida and to analyze their cp genome differences as a basis for seeking easier DNA barcoding for their identification.", "After using Illumina high-throughput sequencing and nanopore sequencing to obtain the genome data, some bioinformatics software was used to assembly and analyze the molecular structure of cp genomes.", "The complete cp genomes of the four species were circular molecules, which ranged from 130\u200a435 to 132\u200a546\u2009bp, and GC contents ranged from 33.89% to 34.89%. Each of them includes a large single-copy region, a small single-copy region, and without large inverted repeat regions.", "These results suggested that highly variable regions of the four cp genomes would provide useful plastid markers, which could be used as a potential genomic resource to resolve phylogenetic questions and provide a reference for mining specific DNA barcodes of these species.", "Our study provided highly effective molecular markers for subsequent phylogenetic analysis, species identification, and biogeographic analysis of Callerya."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
