This study disclosed an antagonism between the two compounds on the protein level to elucidate the paradox. First, the study established the fingerprint for M. torresiana extract. The following anti-proliferation assay verified that the antagonism occurs between protoapigenone and apigenin. And then Western blot and qt-PCR were applied to evaluate the expression and transcription level of the Akt phosphorylation related targets to validate the antagonism at the protein level. Moreover, CETSA further validated the binding of PDK-1 with apigenin and protoapigenone, as well as the antagonism between the two compounds. Finally, the compound-protein complexes predicted by SYBYL-X gave the visual results for the antagonism. The results demonstrated that: Due to the structural similarity and close binding coefficients to the identical targets, when the cells were treated with apigenin and protoapigenone simultaneously, the Akt phosphorylation inhibition induced by protoapigenone would attenuate significantly. The antagonism disclosed in this paper could be a new explanation for the unsatisfied efficacy of M. torresiana extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
