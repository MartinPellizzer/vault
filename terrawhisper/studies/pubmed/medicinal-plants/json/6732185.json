For reference, whole egg, casein and wheat were studied. The diets were fed at maintenance energy intake level. Daily metabolic fecal nitrogen estimated by an isotopic method was 5 mg/100 g body weight in animals receiving whole egg, casein, or Vicia faba proteins. When wheat was included in the diet metabolic fecal nitrogen was increased to 140% of this value. True N digestibility of reference proteins was 91-92% and of Vicia faba proteins 95-97%. Protein quality for maintenance was high and similar for all proteins. Acetylation affected neither N digestibility nor protein quality under maintenance conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bergner", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seidler", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Simon", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schmandke", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Ann Nutr Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "8105511", "ISSNLinking": "0250-6807"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6732185", "10.1159/000176798"]}}]}
