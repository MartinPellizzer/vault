The relative content of every compound was determined with area normalization method and the structures were elucidated by GC-MS technique.", "Fifty-eight to one hundred and four of chromatographic peaks were detected, among them seventy-six compounds accounting for 98.32% to 99.99% of the total essential oil in nutmeg were identified, which were composed of 69.15% to 97.24% for monoterpenoids and 2.06% to 25.51% for aromatic compounds of the total essential oil, respectively.", "It was shown that monoterpenoids and their derivatives were main composition, and aromatic compounds were secondary composition in the total essential oil of nutmeg grows in Indonesia and processed by different traditional methods on the basis of theory of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, it was suggested that we should be careful to use processed nutmeg owing to contain safrole and a-asarone induced genetoxicity in animals and mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella assay, and myristicin and elemicin induced narcotism in human. The processed method roasted with bran for nutmeg may be better and will be developed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Medicines and State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100083, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hang", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiu-wei", "Initials": "XW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxolanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "asarone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01Y4A2QXY0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrogallol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04PD6CT78W", "NameOfSubstance": "myristicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "487-11-6", "NameOfSubstance": "elemicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RSB34337V9", "NameOfSubstance": "Safrole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dioxolanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myristica"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrogallol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Safrole"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18027665"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
