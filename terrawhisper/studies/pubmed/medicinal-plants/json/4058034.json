The fraction that precipitated after addition of 0.8 vol. acetone was designated API, the fraction that precipitated after addition of another 1.2 vol. acetone was designated APII, and the fraction that precipitated after addition of another volume acetone was designated APIII. API, APII and APIII are fractions enriched with lectins, abortifacient proteins and saponins, respectively. T. kirilowii API and APII, and the purified lectin and abortifacient protein (alpha-trichosanthin), were devoid of any significant antilipolytic activity. M. charantia seed API and APIII inhibited hormone-induced lipolysis; the purified lectin and saponin similarly possessed antilipolytic activity. M. charantia seed APII and abortifacient proteins (alpha- and beta- momorcharins), however, lacked such activity. The acid acetone powder of M. charantia seeds and the acetone powder of M. charantia fruits also exhibited antilipolytic activity. However, the acetone powder of Cucurbita maxima fruits and seeds possessed neither antilipolytic nor lipogenic activity. The results indicated that M. charantia fruits and seeds contained components that resembled insulin in inhibiting hormone-induced lipolysis, and that compounds with antilipolytic activity were probably absent from T. kirilowii root tubers and C. maxima fruits and seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yeung", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4058034", "10.1016/0378-8741(85)90077-7", "0378-8741(85)90077-7"]}}]}
