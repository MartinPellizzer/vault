Heritability estimates were determined by variance component and parent-offspring regression analyses. Broad-sense heritability was 0.49 while narrow sense heritabilities by variance and regression analyses were 0.37 and 0.24, respectively. Phenotypic and genotypic correlations between citral content in oil and oil content were very low both among the parental clones (-0.01 and -0.01, respectively) and among their progenies (0.13 and 0.08, respectively) indicating that selection for either of these traits would not have much effect on the other."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Regional Centre, 560037, Bangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramesh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Theor Appl Genet", "NlmUniqueID": "0145600", "ISSNLinking": "0040-5752"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Theor Appl Genet. 1983 Feb;64(3):187-96", "ArticleIdList": ["24264944"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24241013", "10.1007/BF00262519"]}}]}
