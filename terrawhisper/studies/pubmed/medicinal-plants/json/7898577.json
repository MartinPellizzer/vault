Toasting was done by holding the papads over direct flame for 1-2 min. Sharp carousal microwave oven was used for microwaving at high temperature for 30-40 s. Deep fat frying was done by immersing the product in preheated refined groundnut oil for 5-10 s. In vitro digestibility of proteins in prepared papads was investigated by pepsin and pepsin + pancreatin. The percent protein hydrolysed in black gram papads was 80.5, 75.3 and 72.5 for toasted, microwaved and fried papads respectively. They were not significantly different from each other. Green gram papads exhibited significantly higher hydrolysis in microwaved product (79.3%) when compared to toasted (65.2%) or fried products (65.0%). Pepsin digestibilities were not influenced to a significant extent by cooking method and were in the range of 51.4-54.6% for black gram papads and 34.4-35.6% for green gram papads."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, Mysore, India."}], "LastName": "Shashikala", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prakash", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8049-47-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Pancreatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.23.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Pepsin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pepsin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7898577", "10.1002/food.19950390105"]}}]}
