Their advantageous therapeutic effects in diverse pathological complications lead researchers to give an ever-increasing emphasis on them and discover their novel therapeutic potentials. Among these, the heat stable, xanthonoid group of organic molecules has gained special importance with distinctive regards to the bioactive molecule mangiferin due to its solubility in water. Mangiferin, a yellow polyphenol having C-glycosyl xanthone structure, is widely present in different edible sources like mango, and possesses numerous biological activities. Extensive research with this molecule shows its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, antimicrobial, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. Thus, it provides protection against a wide range of physiological disorders. The C-glucosyl linkage and polyhydroxy groups in mangiferin's structure contribute essentially to its free radical-scavenging activity. Moreover, its ability in regulating various transcription factors like NF-\u03baB, Nrf-2, etc. and modulating the expression of different proinflammatory signaling intermediates like tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, COX-2, etc. contribute to its anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic potentials. In this comprehensive article, information has been provided about the sources, chemical structure, metabolism, and different biological activities of mangiferin with special emphasis on the underlying cellular signal transduction pathways. Insights into an in-depth assessment of mangiferin's anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential have also been discussed in detail. On an overall perspective, this review aims to stage mangiferin's diversified therapeutic applications and its emerging possibility as a promising drug in future based on its anti-inflammatory property. \u00a9 2016 BioFactors, 42(5):459-474, 2016."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India."}], "LastName": "Saha", "ForeName": "Sukanya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India."}], "LastName": "Sadhukhan", "ForeName": "Pritam", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, Kolkata, India. parames@jcbose.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Sil", "ForeName": "Parames C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biofactors", "NlmUniqueID": "8807441", "ISSNLinking": "0951-6433"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1M84LD0UMD", "NameOfSubstance": "mangiferin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27219011", "10.1002/biof.1292"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
