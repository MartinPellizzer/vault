To make herbal medicines can be preserved for a long time, they are usually fumigated with sulfur. However, after the medicinal materials have been fumigated with sulfur, SO<sub>2</sub> residues will remain, which, when exposed to water, will create sulfites and bisulfites. Excessive sulfites can cause a variety of severe ailments and diminish the quality and effectiveness of therapeutic plants. Therefore, developing an effective SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>/HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> detection method is important. This study chose coumarin derivatives as fluorescent acceptors and pyridinium acrylonitrile structures as fluorescent donors to create a ratiometric fluorescent probe CPA using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. The probe CPA exhibited a fluorescence transition from red to green under excitation at 405\u00a0nm with an interval of 149\u00a0nm, a reaction time of less than 1\u00a0min, a low detection limit of 86\u00a0nM, and the probe CPA has good specific recognition of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and is resistant to interference. In addition, CPA has low in vitro cytotoxicity and can successfully detect endogenous sulfites in living cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
