The present study was designed to elucidate the structure of a novel polysaccharide, APP90-2, isolated from Alhagi pseudalhagi and evaluate its osteogenic activity. A homogeneous polysaccharide (APP90-2) was obtained from A. pseudalhagi via DEAE-52 and Sephacryl S-100 columns, with a molecular weight of 5.9\u00a0kDa. Monosaccharide, GC-MS, and NMR analyses showed that APP90-2 consisted of \u03b1-l-Rhap-(1\u2192, \u21923)-\u03b1-l-Araf-(1\u2192, \u21925)-\u03b1-l-Araf-(1\u2192, \u21924)-\u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u2192, \u03b1-d-Glcp-(1\u2192, \u21923,5)-\u03b1-l-Araf-(1\u2192, \u21924)-\u03b2-d-GlcAp-(1\u2192, \u21924)-3-OAc-\u03b1-d-Glcp-(1\u2192, \u21923)-\u03b1-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21923)-\u03b2-d-GalAp-(1\u2192, \u21924)-\u03b1-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21926)-\u03b1-d-Manp-(1\u2192, \u21924,6)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, and \u21923,6)-\u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u2192 with relative molar ratios of 4.1:1.8:6.1:6.7:1.7:1.0:1.5:2.7:2.4:1.1:2.3:2.6:1.4:2.0. Morphological analyses revealed that APP90-2 interacted with Congo-red and had an obvious honeycomb structure. Additionally, APP90-2 significantly promoted proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells, indicating that APP90-2 exhibited pronounced osteogenic activity. Therefore, our findings suggest that A. pseudalhagi may be used as an alternative medicine or health supplement for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
