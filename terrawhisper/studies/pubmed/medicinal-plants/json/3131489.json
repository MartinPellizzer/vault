Development of the transplanted tumors was strongly inhibited by the combination therapy, and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) producibility was increased with the combination of a traditional Chinese preparation and OK432. A significant negative correlation was observed between the TNF activities and tumor weight, and there was a positive correlation between the TNF activities and spleen weight in the Ehrlich-bearing DDY mice receiving traditional Chinese preparations or OK432. Marked lymphocytosis, hyperplasia, and hypertrophy of Kupffer's cells in the liver were noted in the tumor-bearing DDY mice receiving traditional Chinese preparations or OK432. In two-step carcinogenesis experiments involving treatment with DMBA and TPA to induce skin papillomas, Zy\u00fbzen-taiho-t\u00f4 appeared to be effective in inhibiting carcinogenesis. These results suggest that the antitumor activities and capacity for TNF production of the preparations are probably due in part to stimulation of the reticuloendothelial system, including macrophages, and induction of a host-mediated antitumor substance like TNF as one of the immunopotentiators."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Haranaka", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hasegawa", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakagawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakurai", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Satomi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haranaka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Response Mod", "NlmUniqueID": "8219656", "ISSNLinking": "0732-6580"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "39325-01-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Picibanil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Picibanil"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3131489"]}}]}
