SD rats were randomly classified into normal, sham, and model (middle cerebral artery occluded) groups. Rho expression and cerebral infarction were visualized by immunohischemistry and TTC staining, respectively. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein expression of miR-431 and Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway-related genes. Hippocampal neurons were extracted and assigned into normal, blank, negative control (NC), miR-431 mimics, miR-431 inhibitors, siRNA-Rho, and miR-431 inhibitors\u2009+\u2009siRNA-Rho groups. Proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. Compared with the normal group, the model group showed elevated Rho expression, area of cerebral infarction, and expressions of Rho/Rho-kinase related genes but reduced miR-431 expression. Compared with the blank group, expression of Rho, Rho-kinase \u03b1, and Rho-kinase \u03b2 decreased and miR-431 expression increased in the miR-431 mimics and siRNA-Rho groups, and the tendency reversed in the miR-431 inhibitors group. Enhanced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis were exhibited in the miR-431 mimics and siRNA-Rho groups while results in the miR-431 inhibitors group reversed. Findings obtained from this study indicated that miR-431 confers protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through negatively regulating the Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, P.R.
