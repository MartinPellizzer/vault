They are also used in folk medicine as products with multidirectional medicinal effects. They are annual plants representing the Fabaceae family. Their edible part is the fruit, i.e. the so-called pods. Whole pods or their parts can be eaten, depending on the species and fruit ripeness. Beans, peas, peanuts, chickpeas, lentils, broad beans and soybeans are edible legume species. Legume seeds are characterized by high nutritional value. Compared to seeds from other plants, they have high protein content ranging, on average, from 20% to 35%, depending on the type, growing conditions and maturity of the fruit. This review focuses on various health-promoting properties of legumes and presents their nutritional value and compounds exerting health-promoting effects. Many pulses have a low glycemic index, which is important for prevention and treatment of diabetes. In addition to their low glycemic index and high fiber content, pulses have \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, which reduce the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. These compounds have antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. Pulses have been shown to contain bioactive peptides with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory properties; hence, they are useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Pulses used in the nutrition of obese individuals provide compounds with pancreatic lipase inhibitory properties, thus promoting weight reduction and control. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Grde\u0144", "ForeName": "Paula", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1087-2000"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Food Chemistry, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Jakubczyk", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pisum sativum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cicer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kouris-Blazos A and Belski R, Health benefits of legumes and pulses with a focus on Australian sweet lupins.
