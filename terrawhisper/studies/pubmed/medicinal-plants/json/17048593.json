The model was established by separation and chronic unpredictable mild stimulation. The increased weight and crossing score, rearing score were measured by open-field and sweet water consumption of mice. Cone cell and configuration of neuron in CA1, CA3 region of hippocampus were observed by Nissl. The concentration of hippocampal synaptic Ca2+ ion was detected by fluorimetry.", "Comparing with the mice of control, the increased weight was slowered ( P < 0.01), the scores of rearing and crossing were decreased (P < 0.01), sweet water consumption were decreased too (P < 0.01), numbers of cone cell in CA3 region of hippocampus were decreased obviously (P < 0.01), and Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic was increased obviously. Comparing with the mice of model, Suyu capsule (22.8 g kg(-1)) could increase the increased weight on the 14th and 21 st day obviously (P < 0.05); Suyu capsule (22.8 g x kg(-1)) could increase the scores of crossing obviously (P < 0.05), Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4 g x kg(-1)) could increase the scores of rearing obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05); Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4, 5.8 g x kg(-1)) could increase sweet water consumption obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05; Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4, 5.8 g x kg(-1)) could increase numbers of cone cell in CA3 region of hippocampus obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05); Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4, 5.8 g x kg(-1)) decreased Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic with dose-effect relationship (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05).", "Suyu capsule can improve all the symptoms of the depression model mice and protect injury of hippocampal neurons in the depression model mice.
