Cell-based functional assays MTT, BrdU, scratch, and transwell were conducted to evaluate the effects of PVW on human colon cancer HCT116 and murine colon26-luc cells, assessing cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, motility, and migration, respectively. Western blotting was performed to assess the effect of PVW on the expression of key intracellular signaling proteins. In vivo studies were conducted using zebrafish embryos and tumor-bearing mice to evaluate the anti-tumor, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-metastatic effects of PVW in colon cancer.", "Five chemical markers were identified and quantified in PVW. PVW exhibited significant cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative activity, as well as inhibitory effects on cell motility and migration in both HCT116 and colon 26-luc cancer cells via modulating protein expressions of TGF-\u03b2 R1, smad2/3, snail, E-cadherin, FAK, RhoA, and cofilin. PVW (0.01-0.1\u00a0mg/ml) could significantly decrease the length of subintestinal vessels of zebrafish embryos through decreasing mRNA expressions of FLT1, FLT4, KDRL, VEGFaa, VEGFc, and Tie1. PVW (> 0.05\u00a0mg/ml) also significantly suppressed colon cancer cells migration in the zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, oral administration of PVW (1.6\u00a0g/kg) significantly inhibited tumor growth by decreasing the expressions of tumor activation marker Ki-67 and CD 31 in tumor tissues of HCT116 tumor-bearing mice. PVW could also significantly inhibit lung metastasis in colon 26-luc tumor-bearing mice by modulating their tumor microenvironment, including immune cells populations (T cells and MDSCs), levels of cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3), as well as increasing the relative abundance of gut microbiota.", "This study revealed for the first time the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of PVW through regulation of TGF-\u03b2-smad2/3-E-cadherin, and FAK-cofilin pathways in colon cancer. These findings provide scientific evidence to support the clinical use of P. villosa in patients with colon cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
