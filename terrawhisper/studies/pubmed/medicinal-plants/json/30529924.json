Industrial, agricultural and medical applications of engineered nanomaterials have increased intensively. The ability of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), when excited by ultra-violet (UV) light, makes them useful for effectively inactivate various pathogens. It is known that ROS also have signalling role in living organisms, therefore, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-induced ROS can influence both enzymatic and non-enzymatic defence systems, and could play a role in the resistance of plants to pathogens. Herein, we studied the photocatalytic stress responses of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) as model plant, when exposed to a well-known photocatalyst, Degussa P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. The photocatalytically produced ROS such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen were confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Foliar exposure of five red cultivars (Cabernet sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Merlot, K\u00e9kfrankos and Kadarka) was carried out in blooming phenophase under field condition where plants are exposed to natural sunlight with relatively high UV radiation (with a maximum of ~ 45\u202fW\u202fm<sup>-2</sup>). After two weeks of exposure, the effects of photogenerated ROS on the total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, flavonol profile and the main macro-, microelements of the leaves were studied in detail. We found that foliar application of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs boosted the total phenolic content and biosynthesis of the leaf flavonols depending on the grapevine variety. Photocatalytically active TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs also increased K, Mg, Ca, B and Mn levels in the leaves as shown by ICP-AES measurements."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
