In addition, a systems biology analysis was performed to investigate the molecular pathway of action of the H. dulcis leaves compounds.", "The ethanolic extract and its methanolic fraction presented genotoxicity through comet assay at 0.5 and 0.25\u00a0mg/mL. On the other hand, both extracts showed protective action against ethanol at all concentrations. Additionally, an NBT assay was performed and demonstrated an ability of the extracts to reduce superoxide anion formation when SH-SY5Y cells were challenged with ethanol. HPLC analysis indicated the presence of quercitrin, isoquercitrin, and rutin. Further, system biology assays indicated a molecular action pathway, where the compounds from the leaves of H. dulcis, in addition to performing free radical scavenging activity, activate PP2A, and may inhibit the apoptosis pathway activated by ethanol-induced oxidative stress.", "This work is important to indicate potential antigenotoxic and antioxidant properties of H. dulcis leaves, and its use can be investigated against DNA damage induced by ethanol."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
