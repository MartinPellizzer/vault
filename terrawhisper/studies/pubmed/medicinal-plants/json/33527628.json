High-purity protein preparations of active recombinant PxylCCE16a and 16c have been obtained from Sf9 insect cells by Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity purification. Our results revealed that the purified recombinant PxylCCE016c is able to degrade two sex pheromone components Z9-14:Ac and Z11-16:Ac at 27.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.79% and 24.40\u2009\u00b1\u20093.07%, respectively, while PxylCCE016a presented relatively lower activity. Additionally, a similar difference in activity was measured in plant-derived odorants. Furthermore, both CCEs displayed obvious preferences for the two sex pheromone components, especially on Z11-16:Ac (K<sub>m</sub> values are in the range 7.82-45.06\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> ) which much lower than plant odorants (K<sub>m</sub> values are in the range 1290-4030\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> ). Furthermore, the activity of the two newly identified CCEs is pH-dependent. The activity at pH\u00a06.5 is obviously higher than that at pH\u00a05.0. Interestingly, only PxylCCE016c can be inhibited by a common esterase inhibitor triphenyl phosphate (TPP) with LC<sub>50</sub> of 1570\u2009\u00b1\u2009520\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> .", "PxylCCE16c plays a more essential role in odorant degradation than PxylCCE16a.
