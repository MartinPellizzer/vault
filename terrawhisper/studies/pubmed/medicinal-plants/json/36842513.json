The channel protein ANO1 is widely present in cells and is involved in physiological activities including cellular secretion, signaling, cell proliferation and vasoconstriction and diastole. In this study, the ANO1 inhibitors were investigated with machine learning and molecular simulation. Two-dimensional structure-activity relationship (2D-SAR) and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models were developed for the qualitative and quantitative prediction of ANO1 inhibitors. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the model were 85.9% and 87.8% for the training and test sets, respectively, and 85.9% and 87.8% for the rotating forest (RF) in the 2D-SAR model. The CoMFA and CoMSIA methods were then used for 3D QSAR modeling of ANO1 inhibitors, respectively. The q<sup>2</sup> coefficients for model cross-validation were all greater than 0.5, implying that we were able to obtain a stable model for drug activity prediction. Molecular docking was further used to simulate the interactions between the five most promising compounds predicted by the model and the ANO1 protein. The total score for the docking results between all five compounds and the target protein was greater than 6, indicating that they interacted strongly in the form of hydrogen bonds. Finally, simulations of amino acid mutations around the docking cavity of the target proteins showed that each molecule had two or more sites of reduced affinity following a single mutation, indicating outstanding specificity of the screened drug molecules and their protein ligands."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
