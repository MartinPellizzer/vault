The structures of new withanolides were elucidated by combinations of spectroscopic techniques with NMR and ECD calculations. MTT cell viability assay, AO/EB staining method, cell wound healing assay, ELISA and Western blot experiments were employed to evaluate the anti-hepatic fibrosis activity and to uncover related mechanism. Molecular docking analysis and cellular thermal shift assay were used to evaluate and verify the interaction between the active withanolides and their potential targets.", "Eight unreported withanolides, withagulides A-H (1-8), along with twenty-eight known ones were obtained from P. angulate. Withanolides 6, 9, 10, 24, 27, and 29-32 showed marked anti-hepatic fibrosis effect with COL1A1 expression inhibition above 50 %. Physalin F (9), the main component in the active fraction, significantly decreased the TGF \u03b21-stimulated expressions of collagen I and \u03b1-SMA in LX-2\u00a0cells. Mechanism study revealed that physalin F exerted its anti-hepatic fibrosis effect via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.", "This study suggested that withanolides were an important class of natural products with marked anti-hepatic fibrosis effect. The main withanolide physalin F might be a promising candidate for hepatic fibrosis treatment. The work provided experimental foundation for the use of P. angulate to treat hepatic fibrosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
