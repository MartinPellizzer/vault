Humans consume CQAs in mg-to-gram quantities through dietary consumption of plant products. CQAs are considered beneficial for human health, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, new biosynthetic pathways via a peroxidase-type p-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase enzyme were discovered. More recently, a new GDSL lipase-like enzyme able to transform monoCQAs into diCQA was identified in Ipomoea batatas. CQAs were recently linked to memory improvement; they seem to be strong indirect antioxidants via Nrf2 activation. However, there is a prevalent confusion in the designation and nomenclature of different CQA isomers. Such inconsistencies are critical and complicate bioactivity assessment since different isomers differ in bioactivity and potency. A detailed explanation regarding the origin of such confusion is provided, and a recommendation to unify nomenclature is suggested. Furthermore, for studies on CQA bioactivity, plant-based laboratory animal diets contain CQAs, which makes it difficult to include proper control groups for comparison. Therefore, a synthetic diet free of CQAs is advised to avoid interferences since some CQAs may produce bioactivity even at nanomolar levels. Biotransformation of CQAs by gut microbiota, the discovery of new enzymatic biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, dietary assessment, and assessment of biological properties with potential for drug development are areas of active, ongoing research. This review is focused on the chemistry, biosynthesis, occurrence, analytical challenges, and bioactivity recently reported for mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraCQAs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4731-0247"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BENFRA Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Alc\u00e1zar Maga\u00f1a", "ForeName": "Armando", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Niigata, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kamimura", "ForeName": "Naofumi", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BENFRA Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Soumyanath", "ForeName": "Amala", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BENFRA Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Stevens", "ForeName": "Jan F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BENFRA Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Maier", "ForeName": "Claudia S", "Initials": "CS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "S10 RR027878", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "U19 AT010829", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeoylquinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "058C04BGYI", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brachypodium"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cognitive Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea batatas"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}], "CoiStatement": "CONFLICT OF INTERESTS.
