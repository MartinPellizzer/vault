There are 13 leaves in the life of turmeric. Leaf formation takes place rapidly to form 8 leaves in the seedling stage. The leaf area and increase of dry matter per day in roots and leaves are smaller or lower in the seedling stage. In the daughter rhizome formation stage, NAR reaches the maximum (3.54/m2.d), and the leaf area reaches the maximum(3302.9 cm2/plant, LAI 4.95). Before the daughter rhizome formation stage, more than 75% of dry matters are distributed in leaves, and in the daughter rhizome formation stage, 50%-75% of dry matters are distrbuted in leaves. In the late growing period, more than 40% of dry matters are distributed in the daughter rhizome. The growth centre of turmeric changes two times in life. When CGRr is equal to CGRt, the crossing of CGRt and CGRr curves may be regarded as the evidence of the transfer of growth centre from leaves to daughter rhizome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11038924"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
