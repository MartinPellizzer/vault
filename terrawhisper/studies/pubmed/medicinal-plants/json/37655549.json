A growing body of evidence suggests that calcium signaling plays a crucial role in promoting various aspects of cancer, including cell proliferation, progression, drug resistance, and migration-related activities. Consequently, focusing on these altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting proteins has emerged as a promising area of research for cancer treatment.", "This review highlights the existing research on the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting proteins in cancer progression. It discusses the current studies evaluating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel/transporter/pump blockers, inhibitors, or regulators as potential anticancer drugs. Additionally, the review addresses specific gaps in our understanding of the field that may require further investigation.", "Targeting specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling cascades could disrupt normal cellular activities, making cancer therapy complex and elusive. Therefore, there is a need for improvements in current Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway focused medicines. While synthetic molecules and plant compounds show promise, they also come with certain limitations. Hence, exploring the framework of targeted drug delivery, structure-rationale-based designing, and repurposing potential drugs to target Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting proteins could potentially lead to a significant breakthrough in cancer treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Jyoti", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Abha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection and Product Development Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101295755", "ISSNLinking": "1746-0441"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Signaling"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37655549", "10.1080/17460441.2023.2251887"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
