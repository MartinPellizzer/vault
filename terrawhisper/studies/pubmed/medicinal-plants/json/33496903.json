Natural populations of Andrographis alata are dwindling due to destruction of natural habitat and over exploitation. Therefore, in vitro propagation of Andrographis alata was undertaken, and successful method is presented here.", "Micropropagation of Andrographis alata was realized on MS nutrient medium augmented with BAP (10\u2009\u03bcM), and multiple shoots were regenerated from nodal explants. Induction of roots was attained from shoots on \u00bc concentration of MS nutrient medium supplemented with IBA (1\u2009\u03bcM). Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis showed that there is genetic fidelity in the regenerated plants. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of regenerated plants showed the presence of neoandrographolide, equivalent to that of mother plants.", "Successful in vitro regeneration of Andrographis alata is presented here, and it is quite useful for its mass multiplication. The micropropagated plants are useful for restoration of plants in nature and for utilization by the pharmaceutical industry for extraction of neoandrographolide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Karnatak University, Dharwad, 580003, India."}], "LastName": "Kadapatti", "ForeName": "Sathish Shekhappa", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Karnatak University, Dharwad, 580003, India. hnmurthy60@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "Hosakatte Niranjana", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Genet Eng Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101317150", "ISSNLinking": "1687-157X"}, "CoiStatement": "Authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Hossain MS, Urbi Z, Sule A,\u00a0Hafizur Rahman\u00a0KM (2014) Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.)
