The dataset consists of three reservoir-island streams and the other is a small stream located on the mainland. A total of 41 families and 90 species of riparian plants were reported for the first time after 34 years of the establishment of the Sultan Mahmud Hydroelectric dam. Trees contributing 60% of the species recorded in this study and the others were non-tree species, including climbers, ferns, epiphyte, herbs, shrub, strangling trees and palms. Among the recorded riparian plant species, two are introduced which are <i>Clidemia hirta</i> and <i>Mimosa pigra</i>. The highest diversity of riparian plant found in the stream of Sungai Kiang, followed by Sungai Ikan and Sungai Saok with 46, 29 and 17 species respectively for the reservoir-island streams. The mainland stream, Sungai Siput recorded 37 species. These riparian plants provide important ecosystem services, among others soil stabilization, habitat and food for aquatic fauna and water filtration. In terms of plant utilization potential and values, 47 species are identified having medicinal value, 10 species with ornamental value and another 36 species are timber trees. Our study demonstrates that the riparian plants are closely linked to stream size with variability associated with types of stream systems. The data collected also demonstrates that the riparian plant community is at the seral stages of riparian forest. This is indicated by the increase in plant species richness as the vegetation gradually changes from riparian towards mature forest composition. To secure ecological functions of Tasik Kenyir riparian plant assemblages, particularly in stabilizing the lake's margin and riverbank, it is recommended that monitoring and legal protection may need to be imposed by local authority."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine and Environmental Science, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Shahimi", "ForeName": "Salwa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine and Environmental Science, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Salam", "ForeName": "Razali", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine and Environmental Science, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Biodiversity and Sustainable Development (Bio-D Tropika), Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Salim", "ForeName": "Jamilah Mohd", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Marine and Environmental Science, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Biodiversity and Sustainable Development (Bio-D Tropika), Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, 21030, Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Amirrudin", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Burkill I.H. second ed.
