F-7 and F-8 showed the highest tumor inhibitory activities (inhibition ratio 96.4 and 98.2% in 2 mg/100 g), and in dose of 5 mg/100 g, the inhibitory ratios were 95.3 and 97.5%, respectively. Furthermore, 10 mg/100 g of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection gave 97.3 and 98.7% of inhibition. In oral administration, the inhibitory activities were not markedly observed, indicating that the polysaccharides are directly acting to immune system. Also the polysaccharides increased the number of circulating blood leukocytes and total peritoneal exudate cells. Although implantation of tumor cells greatly decreased the productivity of antibody (antibody-mediated) and T lymphocyte reactivity (delayed-type) as 6.3 from 9.3 and 5.9 from 7.7, represented by the increase of footpad thickness, respectively. The polysaccharides elevated the reactivity of T lymphocyte in tumor-bearing mice, which were rapidly recovered by discontinuance of sample treatments. Especially, F-2, F-5, F-7 and F-8 remarkably recovered the decreased sensitivity. When the effects on thymidylate synthase (TS) and thymidine kinase (TK) activities were determined, TS activities in the F-2 and F-7-treated mice were markedly suppressed to 73.7% and 79.5% of that in the control (p < 0.01), while there was little difference in TK activity with a slight decrease in F-2 only. However, in i.p. injection, TS activities in the F-2, F-5, F-7 and F-8-treated mice were markedly suppressed to 83% to 85% of that in the control (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there were also significant differences in TK activities in F-2, F-5, F-7 and F-8-treated mice (p < 0.05). These results clearly indicated that the i.p. injection is much effective to suppress tumor growth than oral administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Herbal Pharmacology, Dongguk University College of Oriental Medicine, and National Research Laboratory for Glycobiology, Kyungju, Kyungbuk 780-714, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sun-Dong", "Initials": "SD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Yung-Shen", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheorl-Ho", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.45", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidylate Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine Kinase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phellodendron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidylate Synthase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15369698", "10.1016/j.lfs.2004.03.036", "S0024-3205(04)00680-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
