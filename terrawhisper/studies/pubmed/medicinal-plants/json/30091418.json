Numerous withanolides have been isolated from a variety of different plant species and can be employed to treat various types of cancers. Withanolides are indeed capable of demonstrating excellent anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. Additionally, libraries of prepared withaferin A analogs incorporating an acyl, sulphate, amide and aldehyde functionality have demonstrated the most potential response. It is of particular interest to note that an acetyl group at either C-4, C-19 or C-27 enhances the anticancer effects. Since the majority of natural withanolides reported in patents are classified as \"Type-A\", it is our opinion that there should now be a focus on developing \"Type-B\" withanolides and an investigation into their various therapeutic applications. Moreover, very little real innovation in synthetic methodologies has been reported which opens up huge possibilities for novel synthetic methodologies to be developed for the production of larger libraries new withanolides and their analogs to incorporate chemical diversity. In addition, since withanolides have the capability to conjugate with other anticancer compounds, this should encourage scientists to prepare lead compounds in cancer drug discovery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle (Salle), Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products, University of Nizwa, P.
