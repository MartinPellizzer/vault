A literature search was performed, including electronic databases such as MEDLINE/PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS, as well as other databases not indexed, such as Google Scholar. The search was conducted between July 2018 and April 2019, through online research. Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health and the dissemination of resistant microbes in the environment is a major public health problem. Therefore, it is important to develop new therapies to control the spread of resistant bacteria to humans. Thus, interference in the chemical signal (autoinducers) of the QS system has been postulated as a good alternative, technically known as \"Quorum Quenching\" or QS inhibitors. Inhibition of QS signaling is not intended to kill the microorganism, but to block the expression of the target genes, making the cells less virulent and more vulnerable to host immune response. Anti-virulence therapy by agents that interfere with this system in pathogenic bacteria is a well-studied strategy, including medicinal plants and their bioactive constituents, and presents good prospects. This review aims to provide an overview of the QS system in bacteria and describe the main inhibitors of the system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Laboratory Center, Adolfo Lutz Institute, Presidente Prudente, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.
