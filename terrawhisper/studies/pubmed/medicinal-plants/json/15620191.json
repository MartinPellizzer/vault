HCMV IEA levels were quantitatively detected by Flow Cytometry respectively under the following conditions: Allitridin was given before (pretreated for 24 h), during, or after viral inoculation in which serial doses (maximum tolerant concentration, MTC for human embryo lung cells, HEL) of Allitridin was used to treat HCMV infected HLE cells for different durations (24, 48, 72, 96 h) after viral infection.", "The MTC of Allitridin was 9.60 mg x L(-1). Allitridin remarkably inhibited the expression of HCMV IEA in vitro. Within MTC, the inhibitory rate had a significant correlation with its dosage (r = 0.96). At the time of IEA highest expression (72 h after infection), inhibitory effect was the greatest (inhibitory rate: 89.3%). With pretreatment of Allitridin, the inhibitory rate was 28.6%. When Allitridin was used together with HCMV inoculation, IEA inhibitory rate was only 10.3%.", "Allitridin can inhibit HCMV, IEA expression in vitro remarkably which is probably one of the major mechanisms of Allitridin anti-HCMV activity because IEAs are the very important regulatory factors for the expression of all HCMV genes. Its therapeutic effect is the best at the peak stage of IE1 gene expression (72 h after infection) but it has low prophylactic and little blocking effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric Department, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, Hubei China. shusainan@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Sai-nan", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Yong-sui", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immediate-Early Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0ZO1U5A3XX", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl trisulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytomegalovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Immediate-Early Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15620191"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
