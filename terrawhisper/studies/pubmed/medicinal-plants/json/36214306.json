Studying the anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines and the antioxidant activities of these newly synthesized compounds.", "Studying the anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines and the antioxidant activities of these newly synthesized compounds. To study the anti-breast cancer activity of the newly synthesized compounds, a molecular docking study is used to analyze the binding energy for the nonbonding interactions between the ligands (studied compounds) and receptor (4PYP (pdb code: 4FA2)) against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. The bioavailability of all studied compounds is confirmed by pharmacological investigations using Mol inspiration and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity online servers.", "The two derivatives, 2-(4- methoxy benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4c) and 2-(4-dimethylamino) benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4e) show the most potent anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines. Meanwhile, these two derivatives show the lowest antioxidant activities.", "The different spectral techniques were used to confirm the structure of the novel synthesized compounds. Further, 2-(4-(dimethyl amino) benzylidene)-N- (phenylsulfonyl)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4e) and 2-(4- methoxy benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1 carbothioamide (4c) were the most potent anticancer derivatives against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, they exhibited the most potent antioxidant activities. Meanwhile, the 2-benzylidene-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4a) and 2-(4-chloro benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4d) had the lowest antioxidant potentials. The estimated binding energies, inhibition constant, intermolecular energies, and reference RMSD produced from docking for all studied compounds were reported. These values showed that all studied compounds formed stable complexes with the receptor with high binding affinity. It was further noted from the ADMET analysis that compounds 4c, 4d, and 4e have good absorption, low toxicity in the human liver, and medium BBB penetration. Hence, these studied compounds (4c-4e) may be suggested as potential compounds against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Natural Products, Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (RIMAP), Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Hussein S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Jouf University, Sakaka, Al Jouf 72341, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdelgawad", "ForeName": "Mohamed A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Natural Products, Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (RIMAP), Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hegab", "ForeName": "Momtaz", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Natural Products, Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (RIMAP), Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hamza", "ForeName": "Zeinab S", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Nagdy", "ForeName": "Amany M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Beni-Suef University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Sayed A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology Division, Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, P.O.
