The patients were randomized to receive lavender (250\u00a0mg twice daily) or metformin (500\u00a0mg three times a day) for 90\u00a0days. The serum progesterone was measured at baseline and after 90\u00a0days, one week before their expected menstruation. Moreover, the length of the menstrual cycle was documented.", "Our results showed that lavender and metformin treatment notably increased the progesterone levels in PCOS patients (increasing from 0.35 (0.66) and 0.8 (0.69) to 2.5 (6.2) and 2.74 (6.27) ng/mL, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, we found no significant differences between the increasing effects of both treatments on progesterone levels. In addition, all patients in the lavender or metformin groups had baseline progesterone levels <3\u00a0ng/mL, reaching 14 (45.2%) patients >3\u00a0ng/mL. Lavender and metformin remarkably attenuated the menstrual cycle length in PCOS patients (decreasing from 56.0 (20.0) and 60 (12.0) to 42.0 (5.0) and 50.0 (14.0) days, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, the decreasing effects of lavender on the menstrual cycle length were greater than the metformin group; however, it was not statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06).", "Lavender effectively increased progesterone levels and regulated the menstrual cycles in PCOS patients, similar to metformin. Therefore, lavender may be a promising candidate for the treatment of PCOS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
