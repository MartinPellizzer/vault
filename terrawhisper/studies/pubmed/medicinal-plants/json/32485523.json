However, few studies have been performed to evaluate changes in chemical characteristics on the pad depending on the maturity stages. Chemical proximate analysis like the content of total sugars, protein, dry matter, pH, conductivity and ash, depending on the variation of weight of the pad and the growing region was done to determine the changes of characteristics of nopal. Significant changes in physicochemical properties were observed among harvesting sites and during the growing stages. The principal component analysis was then performed to evaluate the relationship between harvesting sites, growth stages, and physicochemical properties. Results highlighted that Sidi El Aidi can be categorized as a poor ecotype among the studied ecotypes, besides, overall harvesting sites pH and proteins had a significant negative correlation with ash, total sugars, reducing sugars, conductivity proteins decrease with increasing age of nopals while total sugars, reducing sugars, and ash content showed the opposite trend. The high total sugar content, minerals of nopal pad (weight higher than 200 g) and proteins (weight lower than 200 g) could be an interesting source of these important components for human diets and also could be used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
