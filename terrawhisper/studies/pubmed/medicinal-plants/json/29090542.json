Based on the established regeneration system of Sophra alopecuroides, 6 factors of genetic transformation were optimized, that was the concentration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the infection time, the co-cultivation time of agrobacterium tumefaciensand S.alopecuroides callus, the preculture time of S.alopecuroides callus, the adding method ofacetosyringone (AS) and the concentration of AS, respectively. The results showed that a maximum genetic transformation efficiency of 83.33% was achieved with 15d-precultured of S.alopecuroides callus, which was infected by A600=0.9 A. tumefaciens for 15 minutes and then co-cultivated for 48 hours with 200 \u03bcmol\u2022L-1AS. The promoter sequence (1 260 bp) of upstream SaLDC was cloned from S.alopecuroides genomic DNA (gene bank accession number: KY038928). The deletion fragment of SaLDC promoter with different length (310,594,765,924,1 260 bp) were ligated with the GUS reporter gene to form five plant expression vectors named P310,P594,P765,P924,P1260, which were then transferred into S.alopecuroides callus. The GUS transient expression showed that all 5 different deletion fragment of SaLDC promoter can drive the GUS gene expression in S. alopecuroides callus. The SaLDC promoter we cloned has high promoter activity, and they may facilitate its function analysis in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xiang-Shan", "Initials": "XS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetophenones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "866P45Y84S", "NameOfSubstance": "acetosyringone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetophenones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Sophora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29090542", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0076"]}}]}
