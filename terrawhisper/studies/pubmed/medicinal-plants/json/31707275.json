Their structures and configurations were elucidated based on spectroscopic analyses and ECD spectra. Aspoquinolones E and F possess a C<sub>10</sub> moiety with an unusual 2,2,4-trimethyl-3oxa-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane unit, and aspernidines F-H own a C<sub>15</sub> side chain. These compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines, compounds 1 and 5 exhibited strong inhibitory activities against A-549 and SW-480\u202fcells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.50 and 4.77\u202f\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
