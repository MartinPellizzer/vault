Recent studies have confirmed that the Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in neurological disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The regulation of Wnt signaling by natural compounds in herbal medicines and nutraceuticals has emerged as a potential strategy for the development of new drugs for neurological disorders. <i>Purpose</i>: The aim of this review is to evaluate the latest research results on the efficacy of natural compounds derived from herbs and nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders by regulating the Wnt pathway <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. A manual and electronic search was performed for English articles available from PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect from the January 2010 to February 2023. Keywords used for the search engines were \"natural products,\u2033 \"plant derived products,\u2033 \"Wnt+ clinical trials,\u2033 and \"Wnt+,\u2033 and/or paired with \"natural products\u2033/\u2033plant derived products\", and \"neurological disorders.\" A total of 22 articles were enrolled in this review, and a variety of natural compounds from herbal medicine and nutritional foods have been shown to exert therapeutic effects on neurological disorders through the Wnt pathway, including curcumin, resveratrol, and querctrin, etc. These natural products possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic properties, confer neurovascular unit and blood-brain barrier integrity protection, and affect neural stem cell differentiation, synaptic formation, and neurogenesis, to play a therapeutic role in neurological disorders. In various <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies and clinical trials, these natural compounds have been shown to be safe and tolerable with few adverse effects. Natural compounds may serve a therapeutic role in neurological disorders by regulating the Wnt pathway. This summary of the research progress of natural compounds targeting the Wnt pathway may provide new insights for the treatment of neurological disorders and potential targets for the development of new drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110000, Liaoning PR China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9057-191X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110000, Liaoning PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1258-7614"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, No. 39 Huaxiang Road, Tiexi District, Shenyang 110000, Liaoning PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lijuan", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wnt Signaling Pathway"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "56"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38284360", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c07536"]}}]}
