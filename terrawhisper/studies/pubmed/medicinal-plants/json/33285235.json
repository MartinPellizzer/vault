These inflammatory cells including mast cells and macrophages have been elucidated to be vital participants in breast tumor proliferation, survival, invasion and migration. However, the functions of mast cells and macrophages in breast cancer are quite distinct based on recent data. Mast cells exhibit both anti-tumoral and pro-tumoral functions on breast cancer, while high number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are strongly correlated with poor prognosis and higher risk of distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. Besides, many natural products/extracts have been reported to regulate mast cells and macrophages. In this review, the roles of mast cells and macrophages play in breast cancer are discussed and a summary of those natural products/herbs regulating the functions of mast cells or macrophages is also presented."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
