Balanced immunity enhances defense mechanism against infection, diseases and unwanted pathogens to avoid hypersensitivity reactions and immune related diseases. The ideal immune responses are the results of corrective interaction between the innate immune cells and acquired components of the immune system. Recently, the interest towards the immune system increased as significant target of toxicity due to exposure of chemicals, drugs and environmental pollutants. Numerous factors are involved in altering the immune responses of the host such as sex, age, stress, malnutrition, alcohol, genetic variability, life styles, environmental-pollutants and chemotherapy exposure. Immunomodulation is any modification of immune responses, often involved induction, amplification, attenuation or inhibition of immune responses. Several synthetic or traditional medicines are available in the market which promptly have many serious adverse effects and create pathogenic resistance. Phytochemicals are naturally occurring molecules, which significantly play an imperative role in modulating favorable immune responses. The present review emphasizes on the risk factors associated with alterations in immune responses, and immunomodulatory activity of phytochemicals specifically, glycosides, alkaloids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins and sterols and sterolins."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
