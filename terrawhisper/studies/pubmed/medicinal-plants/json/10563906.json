Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1998, 7, 1007-1012), and the tumor promoting action of ROO(*) could be reduced by addition of hot-water extracts of vegetables (Maeda et al. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1992, 83, 923-928). Here we described the ROO(*)-scavenging activity of flavonoids and nonflavonoid phenolics and their role in anti-tumor-promoter effects. A model molecular species, ROO(*), was generated from tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) and heme iron, and the scavenging of t-BuOO(*) was determined by (a) bioassay based on the bactericidal action of ROO(*), (b) luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, and (c) electron spin resonance. Of 17 authentic plant phenolics tested, 9 compounds (including rutin, chlorogenic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, neohesperidin, gallic acid, shikimic acid, rhamnetin, and kaempferol) showed remarkably high ROO(*)-scavenging activity. Some of them were detected and quantified in hot-water extracts of mung bean sprouts, used as the model vegetable, and their contents increased after germination, which paralleled very well to the ROO(*)-scavenging capacity of the vegetable extracts. Thus, a diet rich in these radical scavengers would reduce the cancer-promoting action of ROO(*). Consequently, the carcinogenic potentials of oxygen-related radicals may be suppressed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakao", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akaike", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maeda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10563906", "10.1021/jf980765e", "jf980765e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
