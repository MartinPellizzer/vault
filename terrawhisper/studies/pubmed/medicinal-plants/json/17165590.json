The normal mice were also observed. These mice were treated for 10 days. The weight of tumor mass and mouse were examined. The target-cell-killing activity of NK cells. The proliferation activity of lymphocyte and the production of IL-2 of murine splenocytes were detected respectively. The serum containing FGC-6 was prepared and its inhibition effect on H22 cells was examined by MTT assay and growth curve in vitro.", "Growth of tumor was inhibited markedly by FGC-6 high dose. The inhibition of serum containing FGC-6 on the proliferation of H22 cells in vitro was observerd in a dose and time-dependent manner. The target-cell-killing activity of NK cells and the production of IL-2 of murine splenocytes of model group were lower than those of normal group (P < 0.05). When compared with model group, FGC-6 in high dose elevated the two indexes above-mentioned, and also enhanced the proliferation activity of lymphocyte markedly (P < 0.05). The production of IL-2 of murine splenocytes was also improved when treated by FGC-6 in medium dose (P < 0.05).", "FGC-6 can inhibite the growth of H22 cells markedly and also can strengthen the immunity of H22 transplanted mouse."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Animal Science of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050017, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiu-Juan", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Yu-Xiang", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Huan-Ling", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun-Xia", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fu-Ying", "Initials": "FY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17165590"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
