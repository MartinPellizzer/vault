Water-soluble phenolic content was also measured. A total of 20 medicinal plants from Whapmagoostui and 16 from Mistissini were compared with 16 extracts of plants that were not used medicinally. Medicinal plant extracts, particularly those from Larix laricina, displayed high antioxidant activity, comparable with ascorbic acid, Trolox, and the known antioxidant flavonoids quercetin, epicatechin, catechin. Extracts of Pinaceae and Ericaceae contained the highest levels of phenolics. Factors such as season and area of plant collection, as well as the plant part from which the extract was derived, affected antioxidant activity. Positive correlations were found between the established traditional knowledge of Cree Elders and Healers and the antioxidant activity for medicinal plants used in Mistissini (r = 0.3134; p = 0.058) and in Whapmagoostui (r = 0.5165; p = 0.001). Significant correlations between phenolic content were also seen with the existing ethnobotanical data (r = 0.5015; p = 0.003) and bioassays (r = 0.4178; p = 0.003). These results indicate that a clear majority of plants used by the Cree are excellent sources of antioxidants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de recherche en biologie v\u00e9g\u00e9tale, Jardin botanique de Montr\u00e9al, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC H1X 2B2, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fraser", "ForeName": "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cuerrier", "ForeName": "Alain", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haddad", "ForeName": "Pierre S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arnason", "ForeName": "John T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Owen", "ForeName": "Patrick L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johns", "ForeName": "Timothy", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18066122", "10.1139/Y07-108", "y07-108"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
