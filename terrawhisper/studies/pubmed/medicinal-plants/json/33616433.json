Yunmuxiang originated in India and was introduced into China in approximately 1940. Since then it has been widely cultivated in the southwest region of China for medicinal uses; it is included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Yunmuxiang is used primarily as a sedative, including for anesthesia (Ting et al. 2012). Severely stunted and withered Yunmuxiang plants with rotted and galled roots were observed in a field in near the city of Lijiang (N 99\u00b046'; E 27\u00b018') in October 2019. These symptoms were typical of infection by root-knot nematodes.The second-stage juveniles (J2) were collected from the soil in the root zone, and adult females were dissected from roots. Population densities of J2 ranged from 325 to 645 per 100 cm3. Morphological analysis and species-specific PCR were performed on the second stage (J2) and females. Morphological characteristics are as follows: for J2 (n=20) , body length = 360.5 \u00b1 23.4 \u00b5m, tail length = 47.2 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5m, and stylet length = 10.4 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b5m, distance from dorsal esophageal gland opening to the stylet knot (DGO) = 3.96 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcm; females (n = 20) were pear-shaped, body length = 565.23 \u00b1 86.68 \u03bcm, maximum body width = 407.24 \u00b1 60.21 \u03bcm, stylet length = 9.93 \u00b1 0.88 \u03bcm, DGO = 4.76 \u00b1 0.32 \u03bcm, stylet median bulb width (MBW) = 29.67 \u00b1 3.61 \u03bcm, perineum morphology is low and low dorsal arch round, with a typical inferior protrusion near the anus. These morphological characteristics are consistent with Meloidogyne hapla as described by Hunt and Handoo (2009). To confirm species identification, DNA was extracted from females (Blok, et al. 1997) and ITS region was amplified using the primers 18S/26S (Vrain et al. 1992). Furthermore, species-specific SCAR primers JMV1/JMV hapla were used as described by Adam et al. (2007). PCR produced 768 bp and 419 bp sequences. Fragments were sequenced (MW512922and MW228371, respectively) and compared with available sequences on NCBI. Sequences were 99.48% identical to the MT249016, KJ572385, and 100% identical to the GQ395574, GQ395569 M. hapla sequences, respectively. Morphological and molecular characterization supports the identification of the isolate found on Aucklandia lappa as M. hapla. Yunmuxiang seed were planted in 20 cm diameter, 10 cm deep plastic pots containing 1000 cm3 sterilized soil. Seedlings were thinned to one per pot. At the 2-3 leaf stage 10 pots were infested with 1500 M. hapla J2 per seedling, using a sterilized micropipette. Plants were maintained at 20-25\u00b0C in a greenhouse. Control plants received sterile water, and the pathogenicity test was repeated three times. After 30 days, plants were removed from pots and soil gently removed from the roots. A large number of galls (95.6 \u00b1 2.5) and egg masses (33.5 \u00b1 0.5) were found on each root system. Yunmuxiang was considered a good host for M. hapla in Lijiang. M. hapla is a major plant parasitic nematode with a wide geographic distribution and range of host plants and causes severe yield losses (Azevedo de Oliveira et al. 2018). Through investigation, this is the first report worldwide of M. hapla infecting Aucklandia lappa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Lab of Agricultural Biodiversity and Pest Control, College of Plant Protection, Yunnan Agricultural UniversityKuming, Yunnan, China, 650201; Wentao_Wu121@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wentao", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming, Yunnan, China; 1986204405@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Zewen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming, China; 1963259316@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shaofang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming, Yunnan, China; 174685681@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, Yunnan, China; 1129043027@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming, China; 1339593115@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhu-Hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Southwest Foresttry UniversityKunming, Yunnan, China, 650224; hexiahong@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xiahong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Agricultural University, 12616, plant pathology department, Kunming, Yunnan, China; wangyang626@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33616433", "10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2405-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
