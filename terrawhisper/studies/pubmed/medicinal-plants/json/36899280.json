Nowadays, using tissue culture and regeneration techniques of medicinal plants under in vitro conditions has been able to proliferate medicinal plants widely, which is much higher than traditional methods of vegetative propagation. Maca (Lepidium meyenii), is an industrial plant whose root is the usable part. Maca has valuable medicinal effects such as sexual enhancement and reproductive power, infertility treatment, improved sperm count and quality, anti-stress, osteoporosis prevention and more.", "This study was conducted to induce callus and regeneration of Maca. First, MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of Kinetin, Naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [0.5, 1 and 2 \u00b5M respectively] and control were compared for callus induction from root and leaves. After 38 days of incubation, the first callus appeared, after 50 days of callus induction and after 79 days regeneration occurred. The callus induction experiment was performed for the study of the effect of three explants (leaf, stem and root) and seven hormone levels. The regeneration experiment was carried out by studying the effect of three explants (leaf, stem and root) on eight levels of the hormone. The results of data analysis on callus induction showed that the effects of explants, hormones and their interactions on callus induction percentage were highly significant but not significant on callus growth rate. The results of regression analysis showed that explants, hormones and their interactions had no significant effect on regeneration percentage.", "Based on our results, the best medium for inducing callus was Hormone 2,4-D [2 \u00b5M] and Kinetin [0.5 \u00b5M], in which the highest percentage of callus induction was in leaf explants (62%). And the lowest were in stem (30%) and root (27%) explants. According to the comparison of the mean, the best environment for regeneration of the environment was 4 \u00b5M 6-Benzylaminopurine 2.5\u2009+\u2009Thidiazuron, in which the highest percentage of regeneration was in leaf explant (87%) and stem (69%) and the lowest in root explant (12). %)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
