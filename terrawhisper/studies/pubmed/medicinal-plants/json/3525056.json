The beans were processed by different methods into two physical forms; one maintained the integrity of the bean cells (undamaged bean cells, UC) and the other ruptured the bean cells (damaged bean cells, DC). Incremental glucose response areas after ingestion of either UC or DC were not significantly different in control subjects, while incremental insulin response areas (49 +/- 7 vs. 26 +/- 4 microU X ml-1 X h-1, P less than .05) were significantly lower after eating UC-processed beans. In patients with NIDDM both incremental glucose (150 +/- 14 vs. 73 +/- 25 mg X dl-1 X h-1, P less than .001) and insulin (67 +/- 16 vs. 46 +/- 11 microU X ml-1 X h-1, P less than .05) response areas were significantly lower after UC administration. To test the effectiveness of the UC-processed bean when incorporated into mixed meals, nine patients with NIDDM consumed mixed meals containing either DC or UC on two separate mornings. The test meals represented a typical Mexican American use of pureed beans wrapped in a flour tortilla topped with melted cheese. Incremental glucose responses were significantly lower after the UC meal (171 +/- 42 mg X dl-1 X h-1, P less than .05) when compared with the DC meal (212 +/- 34 mg X dl-1 X h-1). Incremental insulin areas were also lower after the UC (91 +/- 19 microU X ml-1 X h-1) when compared with the DC meal (120 +/- 22 microU X ml-1 X h-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Golay", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Coulston", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hollenbeck", "ForeName": "C B", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaiser", "ForeName": "L L", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "W\u00fcrsch", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reaven", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "RR-70-22", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Diabetes Care", "NlmUniqueID": "7805975", "ISSNLinking": "0149-5992"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3525056", "10.2337/diacare.9.3.260"]}}]}
