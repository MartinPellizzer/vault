Taub. Bark Against Free Radicals, Genotoxins and Cancer Cells.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The present study was undertaken to investigate antioxidant, antigenotoxic, and antiproliferative activity of butanol fraction (Bmbu) from bark of medicinal plant Butea monosperma. Antioxidant potency of Bmbu was examined by various in\u00a0vitro assays. It was also investigated for antigenotoxic activity using Escherichia coli. PQ37 employing SOS chromotest. Further, cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of Bmbu was evaluated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Bmbu showed potent free radical scavenging ability in ABTS assay (IC<sub>50</sub> 56.70\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and anti-lipid peroxidation ability (IC<sub>50</sub> 40.39\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). 4NQO and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> induced genotoxicity was suppressed by Bmbu in SOS chromotest by 74.26% and 82.02% respectively. It also inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells with GI<sub>50</sub> value of 158.71\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by Bmbu treatment was deciphered using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and neutral comet assay. Bmbu treatment increased cell population in sub-G<sub>1</sub> phase (69.6%) indicating apoptotic cells. Further, Bmbu treatment resulted in increased reactive oxygen species generation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential indicating involvement of mitochondrial dependent pathway of apoptosis. HPLC profiling showed the presence of polyphenols such as ellagic acid, catechin, quercetin, and gallic acid as its major constituents. Consequently, it is suggested that the phytoconstituents from this plant may be further exploited for development of novel drug formulation with possible therapeutic implication."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Varinder", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Akal College of Basic Sciences (Botany), Eternal University, Baru Sahib, Sirmour, Himachal Pradesh, 173101, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Manish", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Paramjeet", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Sandeep", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India."}], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Satwinderjeet", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Butanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Butanols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Butea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28207992", "10.1002/cbdv.201600484"]}}]}
