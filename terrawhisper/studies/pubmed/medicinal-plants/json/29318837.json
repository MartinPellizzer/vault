Through literature reading, National Specimen Information Infrastructure researching, field investigation and general survey of Chinese medicine resources, the distribution information was acquired. The MaxEnt model and ArcGIS technology were applied to analyze the main environmental factors influencing the suitability of Codonopsis Radix with integrated 55 environmental factors. The results showed the precipitation and altitude were the major factors impacting the ecology suitable of Codonopsis Radix. The ecological suitable region of C. pilosula was mainly concentrated in south Gansu, Shanxi, Shanxi, Ningxia and, and the ecological suitable region of C. pilosula var. modesta was mainly concentrated in south Gansu, northwest Guizhou, northeast Sichuan, and the ecological suitable region of C. tangshen was mainly concentrated in west Hubei, east Chongqing, middle Sichuan. Combined with the investigation and cultivation of Codonopsis Radix distribution information, the results of ecological suitability of Codonopsis Radix were verified. The ecological suitability distribution result of Codonopsis Radix was consistent with each species actual distribution, which could provide scientific basis for carrying out the rational cultivation of Codonopsis Radix."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infinity (China) Limitedcompany, Guangzhou 510663, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Dispersal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318837", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0186"]}}]}
