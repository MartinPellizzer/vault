It is known for its diverse biological properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial and antidiabetic activities. In this work, the polysaccharides (PARLs) were ultrasonically extracted from Allium roesum leaves then purified and analyzed by several techniques. Chemical composition and GC-MS analysis showed that the obtained polysaccharides were composed mainly of glucose (40.20\u00a0%), mannose (25.30\u00a0%), fructose (10.60\u00a0%) and galacturonic acid (15.11\u00a0%). Moreover, PARLs exhibited a potent antioxidant effect with higher capacities up to 69.61\u00a0% and 71.72\u00a0% for DPPH and ABTS free radicals, respectively. Furthermore, PARLs significantly modulated inflammatory response by reducing TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 pro-inflammatory mediators and promoting the anti-inflammatory IL-10 mediator in LPS stimulated THP-1 derived macrophages. The in-vivo tests proved that the extract was able to decrease carrageenan-induced rat paw swelling by around 68.15\u00a0% after 4\u00a0h of treatment. PARLs, significantly reduced the growth of U87 (glioblastoma) and IGROV-1 cancer cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of about 4.27 and 7.89\u00a0mg/mL respectively. This research clearly shows that Allium roseum polysaccharides can be used as natural antioxidants with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
