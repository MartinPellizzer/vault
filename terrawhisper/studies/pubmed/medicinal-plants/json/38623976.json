Among them, volatile oils are an important chemical component in Elsholtzia, which have various bioactive medicinal and developmental values.", "The references about volatile oils of Elsholtzia in this review were obtained from Web of Science, SciFinder, PubMed, Willy, Elsevier, SpringLink, ACS publications, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Scopus, and CNKI. The other information about Elsholtzia was obtained from classical works or ancient books.", "Traditionally, the volatile oils from Elsholtzia were used in Chinese medicine to treat cholera, abdominal pain, vomiting, and scattered edema. Relevant research revealed that Elsholtzia contains many different types of volatile oils, and most of them display bioactivities, including anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, hypolipidemic, insecticidal, and antiinflammatory activities, treating spleen and stomach. Furthermore, the applications of volatile oils were summarized and analyzed in this paper.", "The contents of traditional use, constituent analysis, bioactivity, and application of volatile oils from Elsholtzia were reviewed in this paper.
