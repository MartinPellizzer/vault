Inflammation was induced by lambda-carrageenan in male Splague-Dawley (SD) rats.", "Rutaecarpine (8,13-Dihydroindolo[2',3':3,4]pyridol[2,1-b]quinazolin -5(7H)-one) was isolated from the fruits of Evodia rutaecarpa. BMMC were cultured with WEHI-3 conditioned medium. c-Kit ligand and IL-10 were obtained by their expression in baculovirus.", "The generation of PGD2 and PGE2 were determined by their assay kit. COX-1 and COX-2 protein and mRNA expression was determined by BMMC in the presence of KL, LPS and IL-10.", "Rutaecarpine and indomethacin dissolved in 0.1% carboxymethyl cellulose was administered intraperitoneally and, 1 h later, lambda-carrageenan solution was injected to right hind paw of rats. Paw volumes were measured using plethysmometer 5 h after lambda-carrageenan injection.", "Rutaecarpine inhibited COX-2 and COX-1 dependent phases of PGD2 generation in BMMC in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.28 microM and 8.7 microM, respectively. It inhibited COX-2-dependent conversion of exogenous arachidonic acid to PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner by the COX-2-transfected HEK293 cells. However, rutaecarpine inhibited neither PLA2 and COX-1 activity nor COX-2 protein and mRNA expression up to the concentration of 30 microM in BMMC, indicating that rutaecarpine directly inhibited COX-2 activity. Furthermore, rutaecarpine showed in vivo anti-inflammatory activity on rat lambda-carrageenan induced paw edema by intraperitoneal administration.", "Anti-inflammatory activity of Evodia rutaecarpa could be attributed at least in part by inhibition of COS-2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Yeungnam University, Gyongsan, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murakami", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kudo", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Inflamm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9508160", "ISSNLinking": "1023-3830"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinazolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8XZV289PRY", "NameOfSubstance": "rutecarpine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "PTGS1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "PTGS2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ptgs1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ptgs1 protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quinazolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transfection"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10669112", "10.1007/s000110050512", "10.1007/s000110050512"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
