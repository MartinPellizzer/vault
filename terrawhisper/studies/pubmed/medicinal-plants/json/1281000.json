The addition of the detergent-solubilized material to the membranes resulted in a strong increase of the membrane conductance. To identify the proteins responsible for membrane activity the detergent extracts were applied to a hydroxyapatite (HTP) column and the fractions were tested for channel formation. The eluate of the column contained a protein which migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This channel was identified as the porin of pea mitochondria since it formed voltage-dependent channels with single-channel conductances of 1.5 and 3.7 nS in 1 M KCl and an estimated effective diameter of about 1.7 nm. Further elution of the column with KCl containing solutions yielded fractions which resulted in the formation of transient channels in lipid bilayer membranes. These channels had a single-channel conductance of 2.2 nS in 1 M KCl and had also the characteristics of general diffusion pores with an estimated effective diameter of 1.2 nm. Zero-current membrane potential measurements suggested that pea porin was anion-selective in the open state. The selectivity of the second channel was investigated by the measurement of the reversal potential. It was also slightly anion-selective. Its possible role in the metabolism of mitochondria is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Biotechnologie, Biozentrum, Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schmid", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kr\u00f6mer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heldt", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Benz", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Porins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Porins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1281000", "10.1016/0005-2736(92)90389-4", "0005-2736(92)90389-4"]}}]}
