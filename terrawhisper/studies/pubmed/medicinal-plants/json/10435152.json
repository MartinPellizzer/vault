There was an overwhelming male predominance (male:female = 15:1). The mean age of the patients was 52. The peak age of oral SCC patients declined from 50 to 59 years in the first six years (1985-1990) and 40-49 years in the last six years (1991-1996). The most common site of oral SCC was the buccal mucosa with 263 patients (37.4%). Most patients (346/703 patients; 49.2%) had stage III cancer. The most common site of occurrence of SCC was the buccal mucosa (263/703 patients; 37.4%), both overall and in patients who chewed betel quid alone or in combination with cigarette smoking and/or alcohol consumption; the tongue was the most common site among patients without any oral habits (18/48 patients; 37.5%). Furthermore, the age of occurrence was on average 6-12 years younger among patients who chewed betel quid than in those who did not. Of the 703 patients, 496 received treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Of these, 209 (42.1%) died. The cancer stage significantly influenced mortality: the 5-year survival rate in patients treated from 1985 to 1991 was 72% in those with stage I, 38.9% in those with stage II, 26.7% in those with stage III, and 11.8% in those with stage IV cancer. Six variables were found to significantly affect survival: tumor size, lymph node involvement, surgery, betel quid chewing, staging, and histological differentiation (all p < 0.05, Kaplan-Meier analysis with log rank test). Of these, surgery and cancer stage independently affected survival in a proportional hazards model (both p < 0.0001). Therefore, the early surgical intervention, and the withdrawal from oral habits, especially betel quid chewing, will be advantageous to patients' survival."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral Pathology Department, School of Dentistry, Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, ROC."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y K", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Oral Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9709118", "ISSNLinking": "1368-8375"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10435152", "10.1016/s1368-8375(98)00101-8", "S1368-8375(98)00101-8"]}}]}
