(Liliaceae) (garlic) is a medicinal plant that is widely used in herbal medicine. Nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that is induced by long-term hyperglycaemia.", "The effects of aqueous extract of garlic (AGE) on the expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and oxidative stress status were studied in the kidneys of rats with streptozotocin (STZ)\u2009+\u2009nicotinamide-induced diabetes.", "Twenty-four Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control rats, rats with STZ\u2009+\u2009nicotinamide-induced diabetes that received a single dose of STZ (65\u2009mg/kg) and nicotinamide (110\u2009mg/kg) intraperitoneally, diabetic rats that were treated with garlic (2\u2009g/kg/d, gavage), and normal rats that received garlic (2\u2009g/kg/d, gavage). The glucose level was determined in the start of study, 7 d after induction of diabetes and 33 d after treatment with garlic. At the end of the treatment period, urea, uric acid and creatinine levels were estimated in sera. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant status (TOS), nitric oxide (NO) levels and TNF-\u03b1 gene and protein expression were measured in the renal tissues of the rats.", "The glucose, uric acid, and urea levels increased in the serum of diabetic rats compared with control rats, and decreased in garlic-treated diabetic rats compared with diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.05). MDA, TOS and NO increased (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in diabetic rats compared with the control group, and decreased in garlic-treated diabetic rats compared with diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The level of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA did not differ between groups but the TNF-\u03b1 protein level in diabetic rats was higher than in the control rats (p\u2009<\u20090.01), whereas after treatment with garlic, it was close to the normal level (p\u2009<\u20090.01).", "These results indicate that garlic extract has hypoglycaemic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, it can be useful for the alleviation of diabetic complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Clinical Biochemistry , School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Students Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ziamajidi", "ForeName": "Nasrin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Clinical Biochemistry , School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Nasiri", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Clinical Biochemistry , School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasalipourkabir", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Clinical Biochemistry , School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Students Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences , Hamadan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi Moheb", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25X51I8RD4", "NameOfSubstance": "Niacinamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Niacinamide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Arivazhagan S, Balasenthil S, Nagini S.. 2000.
