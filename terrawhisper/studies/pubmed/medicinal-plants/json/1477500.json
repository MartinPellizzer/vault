The results showed that the number of CFU-E, BFU-E of bone marrow was found lower in CRF patients than that in normal controls, and there was inhibitory action in the CRF serum on the number of CFU-E, BFU-E of normal human bone marrow. After treatment with baoyuantang, the amount of Hb was increased and creatinine decreased in CRF patients, and its effective rate reached 83.3%. The above-mentioned inhibitory action in CRF serum was also reduced post-treatment. The results indicated that baoyuantang could increase the ability for proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor and adjust anemia in CRF patient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2nd Affiliated Hospital of Human Medical University, Changsha."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Y P", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Q C", "Initials": "QC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemoglobins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony-Forming Units Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythroid Precursor Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hemoglobins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Failure, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Yang Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1477500"]}}]}
