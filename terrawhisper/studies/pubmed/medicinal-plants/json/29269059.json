Derived from the fluorescence-based techniques, a rapid, convenient and efficient method for the detection of three carbamate pesticides, including carbofuran, aldicarb and methomyl has been developed by using core-shell QDs. By optimizing experimental parameters, the system demonstrated high detection sensitivities for the investigated carbamates, with the lowest detectable concentrations less than 0.05\u202f\u03bcM. The molecular docking study indicated that the selected carbamate pesticides bound to the catalytic active site of acetylcholinesterase via \u03c0-\u03c0 or H-\u03c0 interactions, which also revealed the potential mechanism of the differences in inhibition strength among the three pesticides on AChE. Moreover, in order to investigate the applicability and reliability of the proposed method for the pesticide analysis in real sample with complex matrix, the matrix effects of eight common MPs have been systematically explored. These findings suggested that this technique was a simple, sensitive and reliable method for rapid determination of carbamate pesticides in real samples, especially those with complex matrices like MPs, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural crops."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
