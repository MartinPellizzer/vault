VA and its associated compounds are believed to play a significant role in preventing diseases, underscoring the need for a systematic investigation. Herein, we report a 4-step synthesis employing the classical organic reactions, such as Willamson's alkylation, Fischer-Spier reaction, and Steglich esterification, complemented with a protection-deprotection strategy to prepare 46 VA derivatives across the five series (1a-1i, 2a-2i, 3, 3a-3i, 4a-4i, 5a-5i) in high yields. The synthesized compounds were investigated for their antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and toxic effects. Notably, compound 1a demonstrated remarkable ROS inhibition with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, which is more than twice as effective as the standard ibuprofen drug. A subset of the synthesized derivatives (2b, 2c, 2e, 3b-3d, 4a-4c, 5a, and 5e) manifested their antifungal effect against drug-resistant Candida strains. Compound 5g, in particular, revealed synergism with the established antifungal drugs amphotericin B (AMB) and fluconazole (FLZ), doubling FLZ's potency against azole resistant Candida albican ATCC 36082. Furthermore, 5g improved the potency of these antifungals against FLZ-sensitive strains, including C. glabrata ATCC 2001 and C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, as well as various multidrug-resistant (MDR) Candida strains, namely C. albicans ATCC 14053, C. albicans CL1, and C. krusei SH2L OM341600. Additionally, pharmacodynamics of compound 5g was examined using time-kill assay, and a benign safety profile was observed with no hemolytic activity in whole blood, and no cytotoxicity towards the normal BJ human cell line. The synergistic potential of 5g was further investigated through both experimental methods and docking simulations.These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of VA derivatives, particularly in addressing inflammation and circumventing FLZ resistance in Candida albicans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
