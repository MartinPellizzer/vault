RA is a precursor of SAB, and tyrosine transaminase (TAT, EC 2.6.1.5) is a crucial rate-limiting enzyme in their metabolism pathway. This study identified a novel TAT gene, SmTAT3-2, and found that it is a new transcript derived from unconventional splicing of SmTAT3. We used different substrates for enzymatic reaction with SmTAT1, SmTAT3 and SmTAT3-2. Subcellular localization of SmTAT1 and SmTAT3-2 was completed based on submicroscopic techniques. In addition, they were overexpressed and CRISPR/Cas9 gene edited in hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza. Revealed SmTAT3-2 and SmTAT1 showed a stronger affinity for L-tyrosine than SmTAT3, localized in the cytoplasm, and promoted the synthesis of phenolic acid. In overexpressed SmTAT3-2 hairy roots, the content of RA and SAB was significantly increased by 2.53 and 3.38 fold, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of overexpressed SmTAT1 strain compared with EV strain. These findings provide a valuable key enzyme gene for the phenolic acids metabolism pathway and offer a theoretical basis for the clinical application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
