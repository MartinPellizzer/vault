Micheli (Alismataceae), known as chap\u00e9u-de-couro in Brazil, is popularly used to treat inflammatory diseases. We have previously demonstrated a significant reduction in the acute inflammation for the aqueous extract of E. macrophyllus (AEEm) and its ethanolic fraction (Fr20) and described that hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives present in SF1 (Fr20 subfraction) showed higher anti-inflammatory properties by mechanisms that include a reduction of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CKCL1/KC, LTB4, and PGE2 levels in exudate.", "This work describes the acute toxicological effect of SF1 subfraction on SW mice treated orally for five days in the air pouch model by evaluating the hematological and biochemical determinations on the blood samples; the relative organ weight and its histopathological analysis; the liver genotoxicity assessment and the activity of liver enzymes from xenobiotic metabolism.", "Fr20 was earlier fractionated on the Sephadex LH-20 column, yielding mainly four subfractions, including SF1. The SF1 toxicity was evaluated in mice challenged with carrageenan on the air pouch inflammation model and orally treated for five days. The body weight was monitored daily, and the organs were weighed after the euthanasia. Hematological and biochemical determinations were carried out using specific commercial kits and following the protocols provided by the manufacturers. The organs were fixed, sectioned, processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining, and analyzed by light microscopy. Genotoxicity assessment was performed by the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis. Livers were processed for ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) assays.", "SF1 exhibited low toxicity, as no significant discrepancy was observed in the relative weight of the body organs of mice. Moreover, the daily treatment with SF1 did not alter the number and percentage of red blood cells or hemoglobin concentration in the blood. The treatment with SF1 did not affect the creatinine concentration, but the 25\u00a0mg/kg dose reduced the plasma urea level and uric acid, suggesting its use in treating acute renal failure. The parameters analyzed did not present biochemical alterations indicative of liver disease. Regarding serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, a significant decrease was detected in both parameters in mice treated with SF1. In addition, the histopathological analysis showed that inflammatory focus in the livers seemed more relevant in the control groups than in those treated. There were no significant changes in the renal or splenic tissues of animals treated with SF1. Treatment with SF1 also does not have a genotoxic effect on liver cells.", "Treatment with SF1 showed no toxicity in mice at doses equivalent to those recommended for humans, which provides evidence of the safety of the therapeutic use of this subfraction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
