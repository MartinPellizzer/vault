Here, we demonstrated that <i>O. odorata</i> extract inhibits the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma cell lines In Vitro, and also inhibits the growth of melanoma cells In Vivo. After partitioning the extract with <i>n</i>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and <i>n</i>-butanol, it was found that the butanol-soluble (OOB) and water-soluble (OOW) fractions of <i>O. odorata</i> extract are effective at inhibiting tumor cell growth In Vivo although OOW is more effective than OOB. Interestingly, these fractions did not inhibit the growth of non-cancerous cells. The anti-proliferative effects of the OOW fraction were found to be mediated by inhibition of glycolysis and cellular respiration. UPLC of both fractions showed two major common peaks, which were predicted to be hydrolyzable tannin-related compounds. Taken together, these data suggest that <i>O. odorata</i> extract has anti-tumor properties, and the molecular mechanism involves metabolic alterations and inhibition of cell proliferation. <i>O. odorata</i> extract therefore holds promise as a novel natural product for the treatment of cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Korea University, Sejong, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yeji", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Korea University, Sejong, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sang Hyuk", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Korea University, Sejong, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jung-Hoon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Cheong-ju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Hyung Won", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Cheong-ju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Hyun-Jae", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4590-3644"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Cheong-ju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Won Jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cosmetic and Biotechnology, Hoseo University, Asan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Eunmi", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Cosmetic and Biotechnology, Hoseo University, Asan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sung-Jo", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Korea University, Sejong, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jun", "ForeName": "Hyun Sik", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9182-7000"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Korea University, Sejong, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "Un-Hwan", "Initials": "UH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oenothera"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32964733", "10.1080/01635581.2020.1824000"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
