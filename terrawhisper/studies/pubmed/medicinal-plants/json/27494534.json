Using a simple and reliable reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the amount of 3-acetyl-11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (AKBA) in the BSE was found to be 18.5% w/w. The results confirmed that BSE and AKBA, at concentrations as high as 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL or 10\u2009\u03bcM, respectively, caused no significant cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Co- and pretreatment with BSE (25-100\u2009\u03bcg/mL) or AKBA (5\u2009\u03bcM) restored the viability of PC12 and N2a cells under glutamate toxicity (8\u2009mM). Treatment with BSE and AKBA also attenuated the toxic effects of glutamate on intracellular reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and oxidative DNA damage compared with the untreated glutamate-injured cells. Furthermore, BSE and AKBA decreased the apoptotic cell population in the sub-G1 region and the rate of both early and late-stage apoptosis induced by glutamate in the cells. Our data suggest that the protective effects of Boswellia extract and AKBA against glutamate toxicity in PC12 and N2a cells may be mediated through the amelioration of the oxidative stress and the resultant apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}], "LastName": "Rajabian", "ForeName": "Arezoo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}], "LastName": "Hayatdavoudi", "ForeName": "Parichehr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Neurocognitive Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad, Iran ."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "DNA Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004522", "ISSNLinking": "1044-5498"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boswellia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27494534", "10.1089/dna.2016.3332"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
