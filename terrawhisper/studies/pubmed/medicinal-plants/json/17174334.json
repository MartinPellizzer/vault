The enzyme is a homodimeric glycoprotein and catalyzes the conversion of a specific non-protein sulfur-containing amino acid alliin ((+S)-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide) to allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate, the well known biologically active component of freshly crushed garlic), pyruvate and ammonia. The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of (+S)-allyl-L-cysteine, forming dendrite-like monoclinic crystals. In addition, intentionally produced apo-enzyme was crystallized in tetragonal form. These structures of alliinase with associated glycans were resolved to 1.4 A and 1.61 A by molecular replacement. Branched hexasaccharide chains N-linked to Asn146 and trisaccharide chains N-linked to Asn328 are seen. The structure of hexasaccharide was found similar to \"short chain complex vacuole type\" oligosaccharide most commonly seen in plant glycoproteins. An unexpected state of the enzyme active site has been observed in the present structure. The electron density in the region of the cofactor made it possible to identify the cofactor moiety as aminoacrylate intermediate covalently bound to the PLP cofactor. It was found in the present structure to be stabilized by large number of interactions with surrounding protein residues. Moreover, the existence of the expected internal aldimine bond between the epsilon-amino group of Lys251 and the aldehyde of the PLP is ruled out on the basis of a distinct separation of electron density of Lys251. The structure of the active site cavity in the apo-form is nearly identical to that seen in the holo-form, with two sulfate ions, an acetate and several water molecules from crystallization conditions that replace and mimic the PLP cofactor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Research Support, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimon", "ForeName": "Linda J W", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rabinkov", "ForeName": "Aharon", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Irina", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miron", "ForeName": "Talia", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mirelman", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilchek", "ForeName": "Meir", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Frolow", "ForeName": "Felix", "Initials": "F"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "PDB", "AccessionNumberList": ["2HOR", "2HOX"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon-Sulfur Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "alliin lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon-Sulfur Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimerization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Structure, Tertiary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17174334", "10.1016/j.jmb.2006.11.041", "S0022-2836(06)01581-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
