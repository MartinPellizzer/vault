During March 2023, a survey was carried out and 167 samples were taken from passion fruit cultivated area in Yulin (22.6570263\u00b0E; 110.1765019\u00b0N) apart from the planting base appeared yellow leaves, stunted growth, and distinctive galls on the roots. Within the galls, Meloidogyne sp. females and egg masses were observed. From the rhizosphere soil, second-stage juveniles (J2) were extracted, and population density was 105/500 g soil. The species was determined to be Meloidogyne enterolobii based on morphological characteristics, including female perineal pattern, and genetic analyses. Female (n = 10) perineal patterns showed oval shape, with coarse and smooth striae, dorsal arch rounded to square, and lateral lines not distinct. The male head cap was high and rounded, with the head region only slightly set off from the body, knobs large, ovoid to rounded. The measurements of males (n = 10) included body length, 1,230.7 \u00b1 244.94 (997 to 1,569) \u00b5m; a, 38.58 \u00b1 7.8 (33.45 to 47.05) \u00b5m; c, 113.03 \u00b1 26.22 (80.82 to 144.23) \u00b5m; stylet, 15.68 \u00b1 1.1 (14.5 to 17.4) \u00b5m; spicules, 31.83 \u00b1 2.84 (28.69 to 36.1) \u00b5m; tail, 11.09 \u00b1 1.72 (8.02 to 13.38) \u00b5m; and gubernaculum length, 8.34 \u00b1 0.28 (8.11 to 8.98) \u00b5m. Measurements of J2 (n = 20) included body length, 455.75 \u00b1 44.94 (381 to 512) \u00b5m; a, 26.32 \u00b1 3.89 (18.18 to 32.70) \u00b5m; c, 8.56 \u00b1 1.2 (6.36 to 10.80) \u00b5m; stylet, 12.44 \u00b1 0.76 (11.2 to 13.8) \u00b5m; DGO, 3.65 \u00b1 0.54 (2.84 to 4.68) \u00b5m; tail, 53.89 \u00b1 6.36 (39.8 to 62.2) \u00b5m; and hyaline tail terminus, 11.77 \u00b1 2.83 (7.14 to 16.2) \u00b5m. These morphological characteristics are similar to those reported in the original description of M. enterolobii (Yang and Eisenback 1983). The sequences of the partial ITS region was amplified with V5367 (5'-TTGATTACGTCCCTGCCCTTT-3') and 26S (5'-TTTCACTCGCCGTTACTAAGG-3') primers (Vrain et al. 1992). The region between cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) and the 16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA COII) was also amplified with the primers C2F3 (5'-GGTCAATGTTCAGAAATTTGTGG-3') (Powers and Harris 1993) and MRH106 (5'-AATTTCTAAAGACTTTTCTTAGT-3') (Stanton et al. 1997). The ITS region yielded a fragment of 757 bp (OR072957) and mtDNA COII of 706 bp (OR078415). A BLAST search indicated the sequences were 100% identical to several sequences of M. enterolobii (MT406250, MH756127 and AY831967, MN269940, respectively). To confirm pathogenicity, 20 passion fruit (P. edulis Sim. f. flavicarpa) 30-day-old seedlings were transplanted into pots with an autoclaved mixture of sand and field soil (3:1) and maintained in the glasshouse at 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C with 65 \u00b1 5% relative humidity. After eight weeks, fifteen plants were inoculated with 500 J2/pot (nematode culture collected from the original field), and another five uninoculated plants served as a control. Two months later, aboveground symptoms were similar to those observed in the field. Nematode reproduction occurred and root galls were observed. The reproduction factor (nematode final population density/initial population density) was 4.8. The disease caused by M. enterolobii was severe in Yulin city of Guangxi. Guangxi is an important area for passion fruit culture, with about 2000 ha, which is responsible for two-thirds of China production (Xing et al. 2020). This is the first record of P. edulis natural infection with M. enterolobii in the Yulin City of Guangxi, China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanning, Guangxi, China; 447597587@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "X H", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Larkano, Entomology, Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan; solangi_sarwar@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Solangi", "ForeName": "Ghulam Sarwar", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanning, Guangxi, China; 336584315@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanning, Guangxi, China; liu0172@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Z M", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Science, 125388, Microbiology Research Institute, Nanning, Guangxi, China; qlp961003@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38268174", "10.1094/PDIS-11-23-2434-PDN"]}}]}
