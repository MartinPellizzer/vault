Moreover, the severity of PH and levels of oxidative stress increase concurrently, which suggests that oxidative stress could be utilized as a biomarker for PH progression. Accumulating evidence has well established that oxidative stress is also key role player in the development of PH. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that natural antioxidants improved PH condition, and, therefore, antioxidant therapy has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy against PH. These natural antioxidants include medicinal plant extracts and compounds such as resveratrol and melatonin. Recent studies suggest that melatonin provides health benefit against PH, by enhancing antioxidant capacity, increasing vasodilation, counteracting lung and cardiac fibrosis, and stunting right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy/failure. This chapter comprehensively reviews and discusses a variety of natural antioxidants and their efficacy in modulating experimental PH. This chapter also demonstrates that antioxidant therapy remains a therapeutic strategy for PH, and particularly identifies melatonin as a safe, cost-effective, and promising antioxidant therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hatter Institute for Cardiovascular Research in Africa (HICRA) and MRC Inter-University, Cape Heart Group, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. geraldjmaarman@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Maarman", "ForeName": "Gerald J", "Initials": "GJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JL5DK93RCL", "NameOfSubstance": "Melatonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension, Pulmonary"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Melatonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29047086", "10.1007/978-3-319-63245-2_10"]}}]}
