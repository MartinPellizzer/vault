The cardiotoxicity of DOX is ameliorated by ADI in the clinic. However, the relevant mechanism is unknown.", "To investigate the effects of ADI on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and its mechanism.", "ICR mice were randomly divided into six groups: control, ADI-L, ADI-H, DOX, DOX\u2009+\u2009ADI-L and DOX\u2009+\u2009ADI-H. DOX (<i>i.p.</i>, 0.03\u2009mg/10\u2009g) was administered in the presence or absence of ADI (<i>i.p.,</i> 0.1 or 0.2\u2009mL/10\u2009g) for two weeks. Heart pathology and levels of AST, LDH, CK, CK-MB and BNP were assessed. H9c2 cells were treated with DOX in the presence or absence of ADI (1, 4, 10%). Cell viability, caspase-3 activity, nuclear morphology, and CBR1 expression were then evaluated. DOX and doxorubicinol (DOXol) concentrations in heart, liver, kidneys, serum, and cells were analysed by UPLC-MS/MS.", "High-dose ADI significantly reduced DOX-induced pathological changes and the levels of AST, LDH, CK, CK-MB and BNP to normal. Combined treatment with ADI (1, 4, 10%) improved the cell viability, and IC50 increased from 68.51\u2009\u03bcM (DOX alone) to 83.47, 176.9, and 310.8\u2009\u03bcM, reduced caspase-3 activity by 39.17, 43.96, and 61.82%, respectively. High-dose ADI inhibited the expression of CBR1 protein by 32.3%, reduced DOXol levels in heart, serum and H9c2 cells by 59.8, 72.5 and 48.99%, respectively.", "ADI reduces DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
