In Glycine, some of these loci possess introns, whose sequences can provide characters for assessing phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus. Phylogenetic analyses of two closely related H3-B loci revealed a complex evolutionary pattern, producing trees from which species relationships could not be inferred readily. The single H3-D locus, in contrast, provided data suitable for the construction of gene trees whose topologies were sufficiently similar to other hypotheses of relationships within the subgenus Glycine to give confidence that evolution at this locus is tracking species phylogenies. H3-D topologies identified several of the same groupings found in previous phylogenetic studies using the chloroplast genome. However, histone H3-D and chloroplast genome data sets were in other respects incongruent, as revealed by both topological differences and numerical measures of congruence. The principal difference involved Glycine falcata, whose chloroplast genome belongs to one of the three strongly supported clades in the subgenus, but whose histone H3-D allele was sister to those of the remaining members of the subgenus. The H3-D topology is more in keeping with the morphologically, ecologically, and genetically divergent nature of this species. The H3-D locus appears to be a useful source of phylogenetic characters for interspecific studies in Glycine, providing resolution among taxa whose relationships were unresolved in previous studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "L.
