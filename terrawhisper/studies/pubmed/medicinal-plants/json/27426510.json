It processed various medicinal properties including antioxidative, anti-inflamatory and anti-cancer effects. This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor effects of HDW on ovarian cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms as well as identify the bioactive compounds.", "Effects of HDW on the viability of ovarian cancer A2780 cells were detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by cell morphologic observation through DAPI staining and flow cytometry analysis. The migration of ovarian cancer cells which exposed to HDW were detected by wound healing and transwell assays. The protein levels of caspase 3/9, Bcl-2 and MMP-2/9 in human ovarian cancer cells treated with HDW were assessed by western blotting analysis. The potential bioactive compounds were characterized by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS.", "HDW significantly inhibited the growth of A2780 ovarian cancer cells and induced apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by HDW was associated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the activation of caspase 3/9. Wound healing and transwell chamber assays indicated HDW suppressed the migration of ovarian cancer cells. HDW dramatically decreased MMP-2/9 expression. A HPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis of HDW indicated the presence of 13 flavonoids compounds and one anthraquinone compound, which may contribute to the anticancer activity of the HDW.", "HDW effectively restricted the growth of ovarian cancer cells and induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, HDW suppressed the migration of ovarian cancer cells through down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. These results showed that HDW hold potential therapeutic effect for ovarian cancer patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
