This chemoprevention has been largely attributed to the presence of the natural products glucosinolates, particularly the methionine-derived glucoraphanin from broccoli. Improved nutrition by functional foods or health-promoting dietary supplements is an attractive means for prevention of lifestyle-based diseases. Towards this goal, we have engineered the glucoraphanin pathway into tobacco. First, we engineered elongation of the side chain of methionine to produce the key intermediate dihomo-methionine. This process is catalyzed through two cycles in a chain-elongation pathway that takes place partly in the cytosol and partly in the chloroplast. Second, by coupling the five enzymes of the chain-elongation pathway to eight enzymes of the glucosinolate pathway, we show production of glucoraphanin together with other glucosinolates derived from chain-elongated isoleucine and/or leucine. The conversion of methionine to glucoraphanin is obtained via 14 intermediates. Demonstrating the production of the high-value glucoraphanin in a heterologous host has great potential in the food and medicinal industry as a means to generate a stable, rich source of glucoraphanin for the benefit of human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Life Sciences, Department of Plant Biology, Plant Biochemistry Laboratory, VKR Research Centre for Pro-Active Plants, 40 Thorvaldsensvej, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mikkelsen", "ForeName": "Michael Dalgaard", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olsen", "ForeName": "Carl Erik", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Halkier", "ForeName": "Barbara Ann", "Initials": "BA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "101465514", "ISSNLinking": "1674-2052"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosinolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidoesters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oximes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q86A197713", "NameOfSubstance": "glucoraphanin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosinolates"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Imidoesters"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oximes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20457641", "10.1093/mp/ssq020", "S1674-2052(14)60526-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
