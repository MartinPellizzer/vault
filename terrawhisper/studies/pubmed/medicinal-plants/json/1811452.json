Beans are cooked again every 12 hours for 15 minutes prior to their consumption. Due to the adverse effect that the process causes on nutritive value, the present study evaluated the method and preparation practice of beans on protein value; tannin and soluble and ionizable iron content. As to the effect of re-cooking on protein level, findings revealed that there were no significant statistical effects on net protein ratio (NPR) or in protein efficiency ratio (PER) and number of bean cooking. Nevertheless, a constant effect in quality in the first and second cooking procedure was detected. The second cooking gave a similar value as the first. Also, the first and second heating reduced protein digestibility, but the third gave a value similar to the initial one. No changes were observed in the digestibility of dry matter. Relatively high amounts of protein were found in the cooking broth, which was not affected by the number of heating. It was also found that the bean broth contained high levels of tannins in the initial heating, decreasing later significantly. The same was observed in the cooked beans alone and in beans with their broth. With respect to iron, findings showed a relatively high transference of beans to broth, in total iron as well as in soluble, ionizable and insoluble iron. No changes were observed in whole beans without broth caused by number of heatings, on total, soluble or ionizable iron. In beans with their broth, a similar effect was observed, although a slight increase in insoluble iron was detected at the end of heating. A decrease in soluble and insoluble iron was observed in broth with number of heatings. Correlations were calculated among the parameters studied, which suggested an effect of tannins on the bioavailability of iron caused by tannins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Nutrici\u00f3n de Centro Am\u00e9rica y Panam\u00e1 (INCAP), Guatemala."}], "LastName": "Amaya", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Acevedo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Efecto del recalentamiento sobre la disponibilidad de hierro y el valor nutritivo de la prote\u00edna del frijol negro (Phaseolus vulgaris) cocido."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1811452"]}}]}
