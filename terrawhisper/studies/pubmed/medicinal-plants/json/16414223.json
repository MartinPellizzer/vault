In Mali, the Office du Niger area constitutes the main zone of schistosomiasis transmission where both Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium are encountered. An ethnopharmacological survey, using questionnaire, was conducted in the Office du Niger area of the Niono District to determine the plants used against schistosomiasis amongst traditional healers. Forty healers from 21 villages of six different health areas were interviewed. All interviewed healers knew about urinary schistosomiasis, while only six knew about the intestinal form. The presence of blood in urine was reported as the main symptom of urinary schistosomiasis. Fifty-five plants belonging to 30 families were reported to be used alone for treating urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis, while nine combinations of plants were used against the urinary form of the disease. Cissus quadrangularis and Stylosanthes erecta were the plants most frequently used and were reported for the first time, to be used against schistosomiasis in Mali."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, P.O.
