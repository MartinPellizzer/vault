A type of dodecahedral and porous material (ZIF-90) was synthesized at room temperature and employed as supports to construct enzymatic microreactor. The amount of \u03b1-glucosidase immobilized on ZIF-90 was 58.65\u202f\u03bcg per mg carrier under the optimized conditions. In the online screening process, the eluent of 30\u202fs was selected for detection. For the application of this on-line screening system, three \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors with known structure (2,4-dimethoxy-6,7-dihydroxyphenanthrene, batatasin I, 3,5-dimethoxy-2'-hydroxyaiaryl) were selectively extracted from Dioscorea opposita Thunb. Three compounds screened from honeysuckle leaves were isochlorogenic acid B, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and isochlorogenic acid C, respectively. Two compounds including (+)-catechin and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate were screened from Xinyang Maojian tea. Three unknown ingredients were also screened out from Radix Rehmanniae Praeparata. The nanomaterials in the microreactor can be conveniently replaced. The screening flow rate and elution time can be easily adjusted and controlled by microinjection pump. Considering the specificity of enzyme binding and convenience of online screening system, this method has great potential for fast real-time fishing of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors from Chinese herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
