The plants are well known for their different types of alkaloids. In the present study, we attempted to review the chemistry and pharmacology of the alkaloids from the genus Glaucium. For this purpose, the relevant data were collected from different scientific databases including, \"Google Scholar\", \"ISI Web of Knowledge\", \"PubMed\", \"Scopus\", and available books and e-books. Our results showed that aporphine alkaloids are dominated in the species; however, other types of alkaloids including protopines, benzophenanthridines, benzylisoquinolines, protoberberines, and morphinanes have also been reported from the genus. The pharmacological studies have shown that the alkaloids from Glaucium species have several biological activities of which anti-cancer and anti-cholinesterase effects have been highly reported. Besides, the data indicated that most of the species have been investigated neither phytochemically nor pharmacologically. Glaucium flavum, known as yellow horn poppy, is the most studied species. According to the reports, the plants from this genus have anti-cancer and anti-cholinesterase potentials and can be used as a source for aporphine alkaloids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
