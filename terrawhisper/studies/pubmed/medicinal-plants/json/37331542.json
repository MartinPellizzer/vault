Aralia echinocaulis is a medicinal food plant that is mainly used to prevent or treat rheumatoid arthritis in China. This paper reported the isolation, purification and bioactivity of a polysaccharide (HSM-1-1) from A. echinocaulis. Its structural features were analyzed according to the molecular weight distribution, monosaccharide composition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The results indicated that HSM-1-1 was a new 4-O-methylglucuronoxylan mainly composed of xylan and 4-O-methyl glucuronic acid with the molecular weight of 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0Da. Furthermore, the antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities of HSM-1-1 in vitro were investigated, and the results showed that HSM-1-1 had potent proliferation inhibition activity on colon cancer cell SW480 with an inhibition rate of 17.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.03\u00a0% at a concentration of 600\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, as measured via MTS methods. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a polysaccharide structure obtained from A. echinocaulis and its bioactivities, and its potential as an adjuvant natural product with antitumor effects is shown."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
