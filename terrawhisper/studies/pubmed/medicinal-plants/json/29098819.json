The software of Maxent and ArcGis was used to predict the potential suitable regions and grades of L. ruthenicum in China based on the 149 distribution information, climate data of contemporary (1950-2000) and future (20-80 decade of 21 century), and considering of three greenhouse gaseous emission scenario. The results showed that\uff1athe suitable distribution regions of L. ruthenicum are mainly concentrated in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Neimenggu, and Ningxia province in present. In addition, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Xizang are also distribution regions.The suitable distribution area of L. ruthenicum is 284.506 949\u00d7104 km2, accounted for 29.6% of the land area of China.The relatively stable area of the suitable regions accounted for 25.2% of the total suitable region area.Under the background of climate change, compared with contemporary, the total area of suitable region is reducing and moderately suitable area is increasing at different degree at the 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 decade of 21 century. Climate change both can change the total area of suitable regions and habitat suitability of L. ruthenicum. It could provide a strategic guidance for protection, development and utilization of L. ruthenicum though the prediction of potential suitable regions distribution of L. ruthenicum based on the mainly factor of climate change."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Chinese (Tibetan) Medicinal Resources, Lanzhou 730000, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhen-Heng", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jia", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29098819", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0117"]}}]}
