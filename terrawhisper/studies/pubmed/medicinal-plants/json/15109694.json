Increasing trend toward reimbursement of herbal medicines by the insurance companies and managed care organizations have further encouraged their use. Because herbs are listed under the \"supplement\" category by the Food and Drug Administration, the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act establishes no protocol for standardization of the products labeled as \"supplements\" thereby increasing the risk for adverse effects associated with the use of these products. Moreover, there is little motivation for the manufacturers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded safety and efficacy trials on these drugs. Reports indicate that within the last 2 decades,more than 100 herbogenic deaths have occurred [100]. Many serious complications have been reported, including renal failure and need for renal or hepatic transplantation after taking nutraceuticals [101-107]. The anesthesiologists should have a detailed knowledge and understanding of the potential risks and purported benefits of herbal medicines and should thoroughly inquire about patient's use of herbal products [108- 11 ]. In addition,the education of each patient regarding the serious, potential drug-herb inter-actions should be a routine component of preoperative assessment. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), suggests that all herbal medications should be discontinued 2 to 3 weeks before an elective surgical procedure. If the patient is not sure of the contents of the herbal medicine, he or she should be urged to bring the container so that the anesthesiologist can review the contents of the herb or preparation. Although this idea holds some promise in the elective-care settings, anesthetic care in emergency settings should be based on a thorough drug-intake history from the patient or a relative, if possible.Unfortunately, the anesthesia literature has not addressed this new group of health supplements, despite many of these drugs having the potential to cause serious health problems and drug-herb interactions. There is a need to conduct additional scientific clinical trials to study the anesthetic responses to commonly used nutraceutical agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, 3601 4th Street, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.
