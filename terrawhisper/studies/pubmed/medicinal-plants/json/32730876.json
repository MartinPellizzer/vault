Medicinal plants are an important source for generating of novel phytomedicine. They provide profound therapeutic benefits, more affordable treatments, effectiveness, less side effects and relatively low cost or less expensive and globally competitive. Using plant derived medicine is also relatively safe compared to synthetic medicines. Many plants have proved to successfully aid in the treatment of ailments including Sphagneticola triolobata (L.) Pruski.", "This study was therefore, designed to investigate acute and subacute toxicities, antidiabetic activity and also antioxidant activity of flower extract from S. triolobata (L.) Pruski.", "This research investigates the toxicity and antidiabetic activity of Sphagnelicola trilobata (L.) Pruski flower ethanolic extract in rats. Acute toxicity was determined by a single oral administration of S. trilobata extract of 1500, 2000, and 2500\u00a0mg/kg body weight; and subacute toxicity by oral administration every two days for 14 days. Signs of toxicity and mortality were observed during 24\u00a0h and for 14 days. Hematological values and blood chemistry were also characterized. The antidiabetic activity was examined by orally administering S. trilobata extract of 250\u00a0mg/kg body weight to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats on a daily basis for eight weeks; and the body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and lipid profiles were determined. The antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl free radical scavenging assay.", "The results demonstrated a median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) greater than 2500\u00a0mg/kg since there was no sign of toxicity and mortality in acute and subacute toxicity testing. The high LD<sub>50</sub> indicated that S. trilobata flower ethanolic extract is safe for treatment of diabetes. There was no significant change in the body weight, hematological values, and blood chemistry of treated rats, compared with the control group. The diabetes-induced rats showed a significant reduction in blood glucose and triglyceride (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Meanwhile, the antioxidant activity of S. trilobata extract was lower than that of standard ascorbic acid."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
