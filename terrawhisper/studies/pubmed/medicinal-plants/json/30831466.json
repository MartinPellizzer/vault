(Poplar), Fraxinus excelsior L. (ash) and Solidago virgaurea L. (goldenrod) have been used for medicinal purposes through centuries, to treat pain, fever and inflammation, but their mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. The present study was performed to investigate, whether the herbal medicinal product Phytodolor<sup>\u00ae</sup> (STW 1) and its components have anti-inflammatory effects on activated human monocytes and differentiated human macrophages to elucidate their modes of action in comparison with well-known analgesic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) as diclofenac.", "Adherent human monocytes obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in serum-free medium and pre-treated with 50-100\u202f\u00b5g/ml of diclofenac, STW 1, their components, poplar, ash or goldenrod or its combination (0.05% to 2%). Thereafter, monocytes were activated with 0.1 or 1\u202f\u00b5g/ml LPS for 24\u202fh. The intracellular expressions of TNF-\u03b1 or PTGS2 were determined by cell-based ELISA. Apoptotic cells were identified by YO-PRO-1 staining. Protein or total RNA were isolated to perform SDS-PAGE/Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. PMA-differentiated human THP-1 macrophages were pre-treated with diclofenac (50\u202f\u00b5g/ml) or STW1 (0.1%) and afterwards with LPS (1\u202f\u00b5g/ml) and the translocation of the intracellular p62 NF-\u03baB subunit was detected by immunofluorescence.", "STW 1 inhibited the intracellular content of TNF-\u03b1 and PTGS2 protein, as well as of TNF-\u03b1 and PTGS2 gene expression and induced apoptosis in LPS-activated human monocytes under serum free conditions. Furthermore, STW 1 inhibited the translocation of the p65 subunit of the redox-regulated NF-\u03baB into the nucleus in LPS-activated human macrophages.", "The present in vitro investigations suggest a significant anti-inflammatory activity of STW 1 and its components by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine as TNF-\u03b1 and the key enzyme PTGS2 in LPS-activated human monocytes, which is, at least partly mediated through the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation. Our results provide evidence for distinctive anti-inflammatory effects of STW 1 and its components on LPS-activated human monocytes/macrophages and, thus, for the therapeutic use of STW 1 in inflammation and pain related disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).
