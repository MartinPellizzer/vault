Globulin (Glo) and albumin subfractions (Alb-1 and Alb-2) were extracted from A. h. and S and denatured with urea. Electrophoretic and functional properties indicated a significant correlation between soluble protein fractions from soybean and amaranth. The protein fractions shared some common electrophoretic bands as well as a similar amino acid composition. The larger percent of denaturation in protein fractions, which is associated with enthalpy and the number of ruptured hydrogen bonds, corresponds to disappearance of alpha-helix. The obtained results provided evidence of differences in their secondary and tertiary structures. The most stable was Glo followed by the Alb-2 fraction. Predicted functional changes in model protein systems such as pseudocereals and legumes in response to processing conditions may be encountered in pharmaceutical and food industries. These plants can be a substitute for some cereals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, P.O.B. 12065, Jerusalem 91120, Israel. gorin@cc.huji.ac.il"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gorinstein", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Delgado-Licon", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pawelzik", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Permady", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weisz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trakhtenberg", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Globulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soybean Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Globulins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soybean Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11714365", "10.1021/jf010627g", "jf010627g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
