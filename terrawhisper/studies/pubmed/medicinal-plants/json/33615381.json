The total run time was 5.0\u2009min. Detection and quantitation of all three phytoconstituents were carried out by the mass spectrometer, a triple quadrupole equipped with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and multiple reaction monitoring using the predominantly positive ion mode and obtained much higher and more stable response nebulizer gas flow at 3.0\u2009L/min. Linear responses were exhibited for all three phytoconstituents with a dynamic linear range of 10-100\u2009\u03bcg/mL with the values of the regression coefficient more than 0.995 for betulinic acid, lupeol, and \u03b2-sitosterol. The values of percentage RSD for intraday and interday precision were found to be within the accepted limits for analytical methods (<15%). Selectivity, linearity, LOD, LOQ, accuracy, and precision were evaluated for all three phytoconstituents as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.", "The proposed method is accurate and sensitive and can be used for the routine quantification of betulinic acid, lupeol, and \u03b2-sitosterol from the herbal extract and its poly-herbal formulations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.
