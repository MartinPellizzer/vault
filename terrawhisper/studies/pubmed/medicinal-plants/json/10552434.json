Storage under these conditions resulted in an increase in cooking time increased (7.7- and 12-fold, respectively) as a result of development of the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect. Single-screw extrusion of the milled beans was carried out at four barrel temperatures and two moisture contents. The extrudate bulk density and water solubility index decreased with increasing temperature, whereas the water absorption index increased due to the higher proportion of gelatinized starch in the extruded samples. Both fresh and HTC beans contained nutritionally significant amounts of lectins, trypsin, and alpha-amylase inhibitors, which were mostly inactivated by extrusion. Extrusion also caused a considerable redistribution of insoluble dietary fiber to soluble, although the total dietary fiber content was not affected. Changes in solubility involved pectic polysaccharides, arabinose and uronic acids being the main sugars involved. Stored beans subjected to extrusion cooking showed physical and chemical characteristics similar to those of extrudates from fresh beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Agr\u00edcola, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, 28049 Madrid, Spain. maria.martin@uam.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00edn-Cabrejas", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaime", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karanja", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Downie", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Parker", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lopez-Andreu", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maina", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Esteban", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waldron", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tropical Climate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552434", "10.1021/jf980850m", "jf980850m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
