This study investigated the use of traditional remedies in managing various skin conditions in the Central Province of Kenya. Fifty-seven plant species in 31 families were identified as regularly utilized. Of these plants 27 species had a frequency of three and above. Some of the highly utilized plant species include: Croton megalocarpus Hutch., Senna didymobotrya (Fresen.) Irwin & Barneby, Vernonia lasiopus O. Hoffm., Croton macrostachyus Del. and Aloe secundifolia Engl. In the majority of the cases the sap or occasionally the latex was applied directly on the affected areas. In other cases the plant parts were heated and used as poultice. Only in few conditions were the plant parts boiled and the extract used for washing affected areas, probably acting as antiseptic. This study found that 14 skin conditions were commonly managed using herbal preparations. Of these conditions nine (9) had informant consensus of 0.5 and above, with the highest consensus found in management of swellings and skin sores. Soils were also cited as an important non-plant resource for management of skin conditions especially those associated with measles. Since most skin conditions are caused by microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, the medicinal plants and other resources reported in this study form a justifiable basis for antimicrobial trials, pharmacological and phytochemical analysis, with promising results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Botany Department, P.O.
