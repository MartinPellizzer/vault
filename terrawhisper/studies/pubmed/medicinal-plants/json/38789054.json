Known since ancient times for its medical properties, its use in many industrial applications has increased significantly in recent years due to its physical and chemical properties. Considered less toxic than other metals, Bi has been defined as a \"green metal\" and has been suggested as a replacement for lead in many industrial processes. Although the occurrence of Bi in the environment is predicted to increase, there is still a lack of information on its interaction with biota. Even though it is absorbed by many organisms, Bi has not been directly implicated in the regulation of fundamental metabolic processes. This review summarises the fragmentary knowledge on the interaction between Bi and plants. Toxic effects at the growth, physiological and biochemical levels have been described in Bi-treated plants, with varying degrees and consequences for plant vitality, mostly depending on the chemical formulation of Bi, the concentration of Bi, the growth medium, the time of exposure, and the experimental conditions (laboratory or outdoor conditions). Bismuth has been shown to be readily absorbed and translocated in plants, interfering with plant growth and development, photosynthetic processes, nutrient uptake and accumulation, and metal (especially iron) homeostasis. Like other metals, Bi can induce an oxidative stress state in plant cells, and genotoxic effects have been reported in Bi-treated plants. Tolerance responses to the excess presence of Bi have been poorly described and are mostly referred to as the activation of antioxidant defences involving enzymatic and non-enzymatic molecules. The goal of this review is to offer an overview of the present knowledge on the interaction of Bi and plants, highlighting the gaps to be filled to better understand the role of Bi in affecting key physiological processes in plants. This will help to assess the potential harm of this metal in the environment, where its occurrence is predicted to increase due to the growing demand for medicinal and industrial applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author.
