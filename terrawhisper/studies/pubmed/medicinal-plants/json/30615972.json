In this study, a combinative method using HPLC-DPPH and two-dimensional liquid chromatography has been developed to identify and separate antioxidants from Lancea tibetica. Under the target-guidance of HPLC-DPPH experiment, three antioxidant fractions from Lancea tibetica were recognized. Then, separation of the three fractions using two-dimensional semi-preparation liquid chromatography led to seven phenylpropanoids: (+)-pinoresinol-\u03b2-D-glucoside (1), isoacteoside (2), acteoside (3), tibeticoside (4),epipinoresinol (5), anthelminthicol (6) and phillygenol (7). As a result, seven major antioxidants in Lancea tibetica were isolated with more than 96% purity. Furthermore, in vitro bioassay against DPPH revealed compounds 1-7 with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6.16\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08 to 25.09\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.11 (\u03bcM) and compounds 1, 2 and 3 showed activities stronger than the two reference antioxidants (vitamin C, rutin), with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.16\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08, 8.93\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.06 and 7.98\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05 (\u03bcM), respectively. Results of the present study indicated that the method was an efficient technique to systematically screen and isolate antioxidants from medicine crops."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
