In order to enrich the library of SSR and establish a method for rapid identification of D. nobile, the SSR information was analyzed in the transcriptome of D. nobile. A total of 32 709 SSRs were obtained from the transcriptome of D. nobile, distributed in 26 742 unigenes with the distribution frequency of 12.90%. SSR loci occurred every 3 748 bp. Mono-nucleotide repeat was the main type, account for as much as 72.18% of all SSRs, followed by di-nucleotide (15.97%) and tri-nucleotide (11.19%). Among all repeat types, A/T was the predominant one followed by AG/CT. Finally a total of 62 157 primer pairs were designed for marker development. Randomly 20 pairs of primers were selected for PCR amplification, 17 amplified on clear and reproducible bands, the amplification rate was 85.0%.Thirteen pairs were polymorphic among the 3 Dendrobium plants. The results indicated that the unigenes generated from transcriptome sequencing in D. nobile can be used as effective source to develop SSR markers. The SSR loci in the transcriptome of D. nobile have the characteristics of type riches, high density and high potential of polymorphism, and these characteristics might applied in the study of molecular identification, genetic diversity and marker-assisted breeding of D. nobile and its closely related species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shun-Xing", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Disease Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selection, Genetic"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28945026", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20161222.044"]}}]}
