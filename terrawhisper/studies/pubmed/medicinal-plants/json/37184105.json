In the beginning of the article, details of pesticides, their health effects and various cell lines used for the related study has been outlined. Afterward, detailed descriptions regarding pesticides classification are inscribed. In the end, recent advancements in the area of analysis of pesticides for herbal drugs are explained. Solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) are considered as most common method of sample preparation for pesticides and its residual analysis. The most commonly used analytical separation technique for pesticide analysis is liquid chromatography (LC) integrated with mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS as Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QqQ) for the samples analysis where high level of sensitivity and accuracy is required in quantification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8569-988X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Facility of Instrumentation, Pharmacy Academy, IFTM University, Moradabad, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Arun K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9402-8888"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Advanced Phytochemistry Lab, School of Pharma.
