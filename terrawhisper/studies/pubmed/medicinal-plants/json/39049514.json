Some regulatory enzymes, such as phosphodiesterase, hyaluronidase, collagenase, and lipoxygenase, play an essential role in the inflammatory process. Polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, are active suppressors of inflammatory cytokines, modulators of transcription factors, and inflammation-related pathways. A set of flavonoid structures was screened and docked against inflammation pathway enzymes. Amentoflavone has been shown to cause interactions with phosphodiesterase enzymes, while Bilobetin and Silibinin demonstrated an increase in binding energy with collagenase enzymes. The retrieved compounds from the docking study were subjected to DFT theory. The results showed that the LUMO orbital is located on the flavonoid part. The thermochemical parameters indicated that Silibinin is more stable than other compounds. The ADMET profile predicted that Silibinin can be used orally among the compounds. Silibinin can be introduced as a promising anti-inflammatory agent demonstrating phosphodiesterase and collagenase inhibitory properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammad Ali", "ForeName": "Farboodniay Jahromi", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zare", "ForeName": "Fateme", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Freising, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sakhteman", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahadori", "ForeName": "Shahrzad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3937-0127"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Seradj", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Emami", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39049514", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2368748"]}}]}
