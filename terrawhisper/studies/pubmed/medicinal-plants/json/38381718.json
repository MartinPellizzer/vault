The study was carried out between 2018 and 2021 by using semi-structured and open-ended questionnaire.. The randomly selected methods applied for this study were mainly based on household surveys walk through and interview with indigenous communityage 40 to 80, a total of 75 plants, belonging to 63 genera and distributed among 33 plant families were recorded. The dominant Plant families were the Fabaceae (12%) of all studied taxa, followed by the Amaranthaceae (7%), Asteraceae (6%), Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Poaceae (4% each), Rhamnaceae and Zygophyllaceae (3%). Thirty traditional Food Recipes (TFR) and Traditional Medicinal Recipes (TMR) were novel being first time reported from SD., which are utilized by the local communities in their daily routine. These ethnic TFR and TMR have a tremendous role in preservation and sustainable use of traditional food habits and culture. It was also documented that along with cultivated, the wild edible and medicinal plant preparations play a significant role in in the economic potential and primary health care system of the local communities. The study recommends the specific measures, such as small industries, improved export means, tourism and educational activities, to protect the traditional knowledge and biocultural heritage of the region before its erosion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Maria et al.
