SSEE and SSEE-N-Ag antiulcer activities were estimated against ethanol-induced rats by biochemical, histological, and metabolomics assessments. Reduced glutathione, total antioxidant capacity and prostaglandin E2 levels and gastric mucosa histopathological examination were analysed. The rats' metabolome changing alongside action pathways were elucidated via metabolite profile coupled to multivariate data analysis.<b>Results</b>UPLC-MS profiling of SSEE identified 75 components belonging to various classes. Compared with control, EtOH-treated rats showed decreased of tissue GSH, TAC and PGE2 by 62.32%, 51.85% and 47.03% respectively. SSEE and SSEE-N-Ag administration mitigated biochemical and histopathological alterations. Serum metabolomics analysis revealed for changes in several low molecular weight metabolites with ulcer development. These metabolites levels were restored to normal post-administration of SSEE-N-Ag. SSEE-N-Ag as mediated via modulating numerous metabolic pathways such as lipids, pyrimidine, energy metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signalling. This study provides novel insight for metabolic mechanisms underlying gastric ulcer relieving effect.<b>Conclusion</b>Present results revealed potential antiulcer effect of SSEE and SSEE-N-Ag by decreasing ulcer-associated syndromes, supporting their anti-ulcerogenic action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Therapeutic Chemistry Department, Pharmaceutical and Drugs Research Institute, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Heba A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ayoub", "ForeName": "Iriny M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ragab", "ForeName": "Tamer I M", "Initials": "TIM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sadat City, Sadat City, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Afifi", "ForeName": "Sherif M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Gendy", "ForeName": "Abd El-Nasser G", "Initials": "AEG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology Department, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farrag", "ForeName": "Abdel Razik H", "Initials": "ARH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd-ELGawad", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3302-3623"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Compounds Chemistry, National Research Center, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elshamy", "ForeName": "Abdelsamed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Therapeutic Chemistry Department, Pharmaceutical and Drugs Research Institute, National Research Centre, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ammar", "ForeName": "Naglaa M", "Initials": "NM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomarkers", "NlmUniqueID": "9606000", "ISSNLinking": "1354-750X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36484430", "10.1080/1354750X.2022.2157488"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
