In this study, the suitability of synthetic phosphopeptides for this purpose was investigated. Phosphothreonine-containing phosphopeptides mimicking the N-terminal phosphorylation site of the major thylakoid phosphoprotein, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP-II), were dephosphorylated by isolated peak thylakoid membranes. Phosphopeptides representing unrelated sequences or in which the target phosphothreonine had been changed to a phosphoserine were not dephosphorylated. The dephosphorylation of phosphopeptides by thylakoid membranes was similar to the dephosphorylation of endogenous LHCP-II in its pH-dependence profile, sensitivity to inhibitors, and bivalent cation requirement. The same phosphopeptide analogs of the LHCP-II phosphorylation site inhibited endogenous LHCP-II dephosphorylation in isolated thylakoids, whereas the dephospho-analogs and nonsubstrate phosphopeptides had no effect. Collectively, these results suggest that phosphopeptides mimicking a thylakoid phosphoprotein dephosphorylation site can be exploited for further study of the thylakoid protein phosphatase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska-Lincoln 68583-0718."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarath", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Markwell", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.16", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cations, Divalent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Compartmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8394059", "10.1006/abbi.1993.1380", "S0003986183713809"]}}]}
