One of the starch synthases and both starch-branching enzymes occur both in the soluble fraction and tightly bound to starch granules. The other starch synthase, which is very similar to the waxy proteins of other species, is exclusively granule-bound., It is inactive when solubilized in a native form from starch granules, but activity is recovered when the SDS-denatured protein is reconstituted from polyacrylamide gels. Evidence is presented which indicates that all of these proteins become incorporated within the structure of the granule as it grows. It is proposed that the granule-bound waxy protein is active in vivo at the granule surface, whereas the remaining proteins are active in the soluble fraction of the amyloplast. The proteins become trapped within the granule matrix as the polymers they synthesize crystallize around them, and they probably play no further part in polymer synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Institute, Norwich, UK."}], "LastName": "Denyer", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sidebottom", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hylton", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch Synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["embryology", "enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch Synthase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8220472", "10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.04010191.x"]}}]}
