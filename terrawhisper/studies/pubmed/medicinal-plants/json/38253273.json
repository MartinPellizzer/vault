Age-related cataract (ARC) is the most common type of cataract due to long-term combined effects of many factors, and its pathogenesis is varied. At present, the surgery is the main treatment for cataracts, but it is still limited to the prevention, treatment of early cataracts and the postoperative complications care. While, its drug treatments are still in the stage of exploration and research. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a unique resource in China, is conceived under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine theory and has little toxicity and side effects, but it has made great progress in the treatment and prevention of ARC.", "This review presents an overview of the pathogenesis of ARC in both traditional and modern medicines and summarizes the history and therapeutic effect of TCM on ARC including their formula, crude drugs and active components, and also the other auxiliary methods.", "A number of recognized databases like SciFinder, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were extensively explored by using keywords and phrases such as \"cataract\", \"age-related cataract\", \"traditional medicine\", \"ethnopharmacology\", \"herbs\", \"medicinal plants\", or other relevant terms, and the plants/phytoconstituents that are evaluated in the models of age-related cataract. As well as the current TCM adjuvant therapy used in the clinical treatment were summarized.", "TCM revealed to plays an active role in treating age-related cataract, via multi-pathway and multi-target, and can treat or delay ARC by inhibiting abnormal glucose metabolism, antioxidant damage, inhibiting LEC apoptosis, and so on, which is in concordance with the good effects of the global use of TCM in clinical application. Concerning the early prevention and treatment of cataract and postoperative complications, TCM and auxiliary methods remain to achieve better clinical effects.", "ARC belongs to the category of \"Yuan Yi Nei Zhang\" in TCM theory, showing that there are many causes of ARC including aging, and kidney-yang, spleen, sperm and blood deficiencies. At the same time, the viscera gradually decline, as well as yin or yang progressively become weak, especially in the elder people. So, TCM could be mainly based on liver, kidney, and spleen syndrome differentiation, personalizing diagnosis and treatment, following multiple targets, regulating fundamentally yin and yang, and thus justifying the advantages of Chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of ARC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
