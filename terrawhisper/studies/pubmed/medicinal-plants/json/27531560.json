Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses including 1D, 2D NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and by comparison with the literature. Compound 2 was a new natural product and firstly isolated from nature, while compounds (3-4) were isolated from E. stracheyi for the first time. All isolated compounds (1-4) were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines (including A-549, SMMC-7721, HL-60, MCF-7 and SW-480)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Laboratory for Forest Resources Conservation and Utilization in the Southwest Mountains of China , Ministry of Education, Southwest Forestry University , Kunming , P.R.
