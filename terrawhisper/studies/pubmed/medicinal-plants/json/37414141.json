Therefore, this study aimed to investigate in-vitro and in-vivo anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity to evaluate anti-psoriatic potential of apigenin.", "For in-vivo study, 5\u00a0% imiquimod cream was used to induce psoriasis-like skin inflammation in BALB/c mice to mimic human psoriatic conditions. PASI score, CosCam score, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and ELISA were done to evaluate the anti-psoriatic potential of topically applied apigenin. For in-vitro studies, LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 was done, and qRT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence were conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of apigenin. Migration and cell doubling assay in HaCaT cells were performed to assess the anti-proliferative effect of apigenin. Acute dermal toxicity profile of apigenin has also been done as per OECD guidelines.", "Results showed that apigenin significantly reduce the PASI and CosCam scores, ameliorate the deteriorating histopathology, and effectively downregulated the expression of CCR6, IL-17A, and NF-\u03baB. Apigenin effectively downregulated the expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines through IL-23/IL-17/IL-22 axis. Apigenin suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Cell migration and cell doubling assay in HaCaT cells showing the anti-proliferative potential of apigenin and it was found safe in acute dermal toxicity study.", "Apigenin was found effective against psoriasis in both in-vitro and in-vivo models suggesting apigenin as a potential candidate for the development of anti-psoriatic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
