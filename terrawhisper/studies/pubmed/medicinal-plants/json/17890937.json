A 4-day study was carried out using a total of 132 chickens. A total of 11 groups were formed (12 chickens per group) subjected to varying concentrations and routes of administration of QR-441(a). Chickens were given a high, medium, or low dose of QR-441(a) in either feed, water, or both for a period of 4 days. In addition, one group was dosed intranasally, one drop per nostril four times a day. Although no lesions were found to suggest toxicity or irritability, the medium- and high-dose water groups reduced their water intake. This reduction in water intake suggests that chickens may find the medium and high water doses unpalatable. There was no reduction in water intake in the low-dose water groups or in any of the formulated feed groups. There was also no evidence of toxicity or irritability in the nasal-dose group. These data support the use of the low, medium, and high doses in feed and the use of the low-dose concentration in water for the administration of QR-441(a). The data also suggest that QR-441(a) can be administered intranasally without the presence of any adverse events."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cummings", "ForeName": "Timothy S", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guralnik", "ForeName": "Mario", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rosenbloom", "ForeName": "Richard A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petteruti", "ForeName": "Michael P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Digian", "ForeName": "Kelly", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lefante", "ForeName": "Carolyn", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9441347", "ISSNLinking": "1075-2765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Intranasal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17890937", "10.1097/MJT.0b013e3180a720cd", "00045391-200709000-00013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
