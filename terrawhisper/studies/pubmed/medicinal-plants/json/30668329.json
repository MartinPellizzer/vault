They differ in their diverse chemical composition and different types of activities, whose mechanisms are not fully recognized.", "Evaluation and comparison of anti-inflammatory activity of leaf-buds extracts from Populus nigra, P.\u202f\u00d7\u202fberolinensis and P. lasiocarpa and flavanones - pinocembrin and pinostrobin towards human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) pro-inflammatory stimulated by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Determination of antioxidant activity associated with anti-inflammatory properties by means of bioautographic TLC tests.", "Phytochemical analysis was performed by TLC and videodensitometry analysis. The extracts were standardized on the pinocembrin and pinostrobin content. Bioautography was performed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and riboflavin-light blue tetrazolium chloride (riboflavin-light-NBT) radicals to assess the extracts and both flavanones radical scavenging properties as well as potential inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XO) activity. The protective effects of poplar buds extract and flavanones - pinocembrin and pinostrobin on HGF-1 line exposured to AgNPs were investigated by analysis of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin IL-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) level measured by ELISA kit. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of both cytokines was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. The involvement of cyclooxygenase 2 protein (COX-2) was studied using Western blot analysis.", "The presence of several flavanones and phenolic acids, which have radical scavenging properties, was revealed in all of the bud poplar extracts analyzed. Treatment with particular flavanones or extracts from buds of P.\u202f\u00d7\u202fberolinensis and P. nigra decreased the IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 release in HGF-1 cells and down-regulation of mRNA for both cytokines was observed. The COX-2 protein expression was demonstrated for pinocembrin and P.\u202f\u00d7\u202fberolinensis buds. These effects were not observed for buds from P. lasiocarpa not containing of flavonoids.", "The potential protective role of pinocembrin and pinostrobin and extracts from buds P. nigra and P.\u202f\u00d7\u202fberolinensis against AgNPs induced inflammation and cytotoxicity in HGF-1 cells is disclosed. In addition, the antioxidant properties of poplar bud extracts have been demonstrated. P.\u202f\u00d7\u202fberolinensis buds showed the highest activity in both the in vitro model and in the bioautographic tests."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
