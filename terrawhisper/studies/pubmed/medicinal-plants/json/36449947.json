Inspired by the therapeutic prospect of FGFR/HDAC dual inhibitors, we designed and synthesized a series of quinoxalinopyrazole hydroxamate derivatives as FGFR/HDAC dual inhibitors. Among them, compound <b>10e</b> potently inhibited FGFR1-4 and HDAC1/2/6/8 and presented improved antiproliferative effects of tumor cells. Further studies indicated that <b>10e</b> also downregulated the expression of pSTAT3, potentially overcoming resistance to HDAC inhibitors. What's more, <b>10e</b> significantly inhibited the tumor growth in HCT116 and SNU-16 xenograft models with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Collectively, these results supported that <b>10e</b> could be a new drug candidate for malignant tumors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
