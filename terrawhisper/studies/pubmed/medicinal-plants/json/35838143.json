Genetic and environmental factors lead to BC development and on this basis, several preventive - screening and therapeutic interventions have been developed. Hormones, both in the form of endogenous hormonal signaling or hormonal contraceptives, play an important role in BC pathogenesis and progression. On top of these, breast microbiota includes both species with an immunomodulatory activity enhancing the host's response against cancer cells and species producing proinflammatory cytokines associated with BC development. Identification of novel multitargeted therapeutic agents with poly-pharmacological potential is a dire need to combat advanced and metastatic BC. A growing body of research has emphasized the potential of natural compounds derived from medicinal plants and microbial species as complementary BC treatment regimens, including dietary supplements and probiotics. In particular, extracts from plants such as <i>Artemisia monosperma</i> Delile<i>, Origanum dayi</i> Post<i>, Urtica membranacea</i> Poir. ex Savigny<i>, Krameria lappacea</i> (Dombey) Burdet & B.B. Simpson and metabolites extracted from microbes such as <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> and <i>Streptomycetes</i> strains as well as probiotics like <i>Bacillus coagulans</i> and <i>Lactobacillus brevis</i> MK05 have exhibited antitumor effects in the form of antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity, increase in tumors' chemosensitivity, antioxidant activity and modulation of BC - associated molecular pathways. Further, bioactive compounds like 3,3'-diindolylmethane, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, rutin, resveratrol, lycopene, sulforaphane, silibinin, rosmarinic acid, and shikonin are of special interest for the researchers and clinicians because these natural agents have multimodal action and act via multiple ways in managing the BC and most of these agents are regularly available in our food and fruit diets. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that such products had major potential in enhancing the effectiveness of conventional antitumor agents and decreasing their side effects. We here provide a comprehensive review of the therapeutic effects and mechanistic underpinnings of medicinal plants and microbial metabolites in BC management. The future perspectives on the translation of these findings to the personalized treatment of BC are provided and discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier":
