The multi-point experiments in farmland with different Cd pollution degrees[<i>\u03c9</i>(Cd) 0.32-38.08 mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>] were conducted, and the biomass (dry weight), Cd content, accumulation, concentration, and transport of Cd in <i>P. thornsonii</i> tissues under the main growing period were assessed. According to the results, for <i>P. thornsonii</i>, the tuber dry weight ranged from 5.04 to 11.98 t\u00b7hm<sup>-2</sup>, biomass ranged from 13.21 to 29.07 t\u00b7hm<sup>-2</sup>, and Cd accumulation ranged from 15.74 to 106.03 g\u00b7hm<sup>-2</sup>in the study area. The pattern of Cd uptake by <i>P. thornsonii</i> showed that the main vine>leaf>lateral branches>basal part of sti>tuber. The Cd content in <i>P. thornsonii</i> tissues considerably increased with soil Cd content (<i>P</i><0.05), whereas the biomass decreased significantly (<i>P</i><0.05). The Cd concentration and transport factor of aboveground parts in <i>P. thornsonii</i> showed a trend of initially falling, then increasing and decreasing again, whereas the Cd enrichment and transport coefficient of tubers gradually decreased. Correlation analysis revealed that the amount of Cd in the soil was a major predictor of Cd accumulation in <i>P. thornsonii</i>. Under light to moderate Cd contamination, the commercial portion of <i>P. thornsonii</i> (arrowroot)[<i>\u03c9</i>(Cd) 0.03-0.22 mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>] was less than the standard limit for medicinal plants (\u2264 0.30 mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>). In <i>P. thornsonii</i> from moderately contaminated areas, the Cd concentration and transport factor of aboveground parts were 2.43-7.97 and 3.02-9.81, respectively. This indicates that <i>P. thornsonii</i> is a prospective plant ideal for remediating Cd-contaminated soil because of its high capacity to transfer and enrich Cd."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Land Resources and Environment, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bing", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Shao-Lang", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Land Resources and Environment, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Duo-Ji", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Li-Jun", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Science Research Center of Pingxiang, Pingxiang 337000, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Shang-Shu", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bin-Qiang", "Initials": "BQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Red Soil Improvement Engineering Technology Research Center, Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil and Germplasm Resources, Nanchang 331717, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qian-Ru", "Initials": "QR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Land Resources and Environment, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jian-Fu", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Huan Jing Ke Xue", "NlmUniqueID": "8405344", "ISSNLinking": "0250-3301"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Farms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pueraria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37827792", "10.13227/j.hjkx.202212028"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
