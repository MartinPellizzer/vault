Even more alarming are the trends of continued research on such aspects as the deficiency of sulfur-amino acids (both by amino acid analyses as well as rat feeding studies), and the heat lability/stability of proteinase inhibitors and phytohemagglutinins in various legume species. A survey of literature indicates that over 100 research papers were published during the 1981 to 1990 period alone, in just three journals (Journal of Food Science, Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, and Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture) having the highest citation ratings in food sciences on these three topics, with a general consensus about the facts that were well established as early as the late 1950s. Considering the proliferation of journals publishing food science and human nutrition related work, especially in the Third World countries, the actual number probably would be much higher. This trend also indicates that we are repeating certain aspects of research on the importance of food legumes in human nutrition. Are we really any closer today in our understanding and appreciation of why the nomadic human made such a choice for their very existence during the transition to a more civilized society? This is a high time to project the image of legumes in human nutrition in proper perspective. The validity of our continued research on certain aspects of legumes in human nutrition, at a time when worldwide the research dollars are becoming increasingly harder to come by, is challenged in this review. Essentially, it is a journey through the author's personal diary that raises several questions in justifying the continued research support for at least some nutrition-related work on legumes and an account of what research areas perhaps need to be targeted in the 21st century."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture Canada Research Station, Morden, Manitoba."}], "LastName": "Deshpande", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "129"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1297325", "10.1080/10408399209527603"]}}]}
