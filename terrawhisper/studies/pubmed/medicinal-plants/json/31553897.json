In this way, one of the WHO's concerns is the safe use of these therapies. Phytotherapy is a strategy consisting of the use of medicinal plants (MP) and/or herbal medicinal products (HMP) for medicinal purposes. The use of phytotherapy concomitantly with drugs may cause interactions compromising the expected pharmacological action or generating toxic effects. These interactions are complex processes that may occur with multiple medications targeting different metabolic pathways, and involving different compounds present in MP and HMP. Thus, the aim of this review was to summarize the main MP- and HMP-drug interactions that involve specific transporters (P-glycoprotein and BCRP) and CYP450 enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6), which play relevant roles in the mechanisms of interactions. Firstly, multiple databases were used to search studies describing in vitro or in vivo MP and HMP-drug interactions and, after that, a systematic note-taking and appraisal of the literature was conducted. It was observed that several MP and HMP, metabolic pathways and transcription factors are involved in the transporters and enzymes expression or in the modulation of their activity having the potential to provide such interactions. Thus, the knowledge of MP- and HMP-drug interaction mechanisms could contribute to prevent harmful interactions and can ensure the safe use of these products to help the establishment of the therapeutic planning in order to certify the best treatment strategy to be used."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
