Their structures were determined by HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, CD data analysis, NMR and ECD calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All structures were classified into nine framework types: 10b,11-seco-crinine, graciline, crinine, homolycorine, trisphaeridine, lycorine, galasine, tazettine, and belladine. Zephyranine A represents the first naturally occurring 10b,11-seco-crinine type alkaloid, and zephyranine B is the sixth graciline type alkaloid. 6-O-ethylnerinine is an artifact from the extraction and isolation. All isolates were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities. Zephyranines A, G, and H exhibited moderate AChE inhibitory activities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.2, 39.0, and 10.8\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Zephyranine B, haemanthamine, haemanthidine, 11-hydroxyvittatine, and 8-demethoxy-10-O-methylhostasine exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity on the LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 21.3, 4.6, 12.2, 5.6, and 17.4\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Structure-activity-relationship analysis and docking studies indicated that interactions with the key Trp286 and Tyr337 residues are required for potent AChE inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
