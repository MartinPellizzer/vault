The fungi Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus sp., Curvularia sp., and Penicillium sp. were cultured in the laboratory and tested for susceptibility to leaf extracts of the host plant and to proline, pipecolic acid, cis-5-hydroxypipecolic acid, and 2,4-trans-4,5-cis-4,5-dihydroxypipecolic acid. Fungal spore germination and germ tube growth were measured. Aspergillus sp. was inhibited by plant extracts and by pipecolic acid and cis-5-hydroxypipecolic acid. Curvularia sp. growth was stimulated by plant extracts and by pipecolic acid. The other two fungi were unaffected by any of the treatments. The data indicate that imino acids may play a role in the specific resistance of Calliandra spp. to Aspergillus sp."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brenner", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Romeo", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pipecolic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DLQ4CIU6V", "NameOfSubstance": "Proline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus niger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pipecolic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Proline"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1982 Apr;121(2):295-300", "ArticleIdList": ["7103060"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3707119", "PMC238948", "10.1128/aem.51.4.690-693.1986"]}}]}
