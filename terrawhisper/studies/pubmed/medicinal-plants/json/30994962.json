The present study encompassed traded medicinal plants (16) with high therapeutic value from diverse families like Brassicaceae, Berberidaceae, Malvaceae, Salicaceae, Myrtaceae, Papilionaceae, Ascelpiadaceae, Colchicaceae, Violaceae, and Vitaceae for detailed microscopic study of characters that is, morphology, pollen shape and sizes, P/E ratio, pore length and width, spine length, colpi dimensions, and exine sculpture pattern. The plants showed noteworthy differences in microscopy of Wattakaka volubilis having pollinia, translator and corpusculum like structures while pores were visible in Colchicum luteum, Alcea rosea, and Hibiscus syriacus. The spines were observed in Centipeda minima, A. rosea, and H. syriacus being dimorphic spines in A. rosea and monomorphic in H. syriacus. The exine sculpturing pattern was reticulate in mostly studied plants however distinctive exine pattern was noted in Berberis aristata and Berberis lyceum. The highest polar diameter, equatorial diameter and exine thickness among studied plants were observed in H. syriacus (161\u2009\u03bcm), C. luteum (50\u2009\u03bcm) and Vitis jacquemontii (1.10), respectively. Thus, microscopy of medicinal plants in addition to other taxonomic evidence offers a supportive skill in authentication, consequently utilization by local consumers and pharmaceutical industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The Women University, Multan, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Sidra N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mushtaq", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2002-3907"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bio Sciences, COMSATS University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Sofia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yaseen", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sultana", "ForeName": "Shazia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, GC University Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Siddiq", "ForeName": "Zafar", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Technical Sciences Vocational School, Bingol University, Bingol, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kilic", "ForeName": "Omer", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science and Art, Bingol University, Bingol, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozdemir", "ForeName": "Fethi A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kayani", "ForeName": "Sadaf", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "National University of Science of Technology", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30994962", "10.1002/jemt.23266"]}}]}
