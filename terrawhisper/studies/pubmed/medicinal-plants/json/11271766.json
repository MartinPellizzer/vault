Bacteria found to be inhibited by garlic juice in agar diffusion assay included two gram-positive and five gram-negative species. Leuconostoc mesenteroides was not inhibited. Escherichia coli B-103 (HB101, with pJH101, ampicillin resistant, 100 microg ml(-1)) was inhibited and chosen as the standard culture for quantitative assays. The agar diffusion assay was based on the slope ratio method, where the slope of dose response for garlic juice was divided by the slope of dose response for methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTSO2). Juice from fresh garlic varied in activity between 1.76 and 2.31 microg of MMTSO2 per mg of garlic juice. The activity of juice decreased during 11 months of storage of garlic cloves at 5 degrees C from 2.31 to less than 0.1 microg of MMTSO2 per mg of juice. The broth dilution assay also used the E. coli B-103 culture, which permitted selective enumeration of this bacterium when 100 microg ml(-1) of ampicillin was incorporated into the enumerating agar. Selective enumeration was essential since the garlic juice was not sterile and, thus, contained natural flora. Growth of E. coli was unaffected by 0.1%, delayed by 0.25%, and completely inhibited at 0.5 and 2% garlic juice in broth during 24 h of incubation at 37 micro C. The minimum inhibition concentration of garlic juice by broth dilution assay was, thus, estimated to be 0.5%, which is equivalent to 3.46 microg of MMTSO2 per mg of garlic juice by the agar diffusion assay."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7624, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Unal", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fleming", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McFeeters", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thompson", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Breidt", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giesbrecht", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Prot", "NlmUniqueID": "7703944", "ISSNLinking": "0362-028X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AT5C31J09G", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyl Methanesulfonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunodiffusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methyl Methanesulfonate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11271766", "10.4315/0362-028x-64.2.189", "S0362-028X(22)00789-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
