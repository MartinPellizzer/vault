Homogeneous oligosaccharides of known structure, purified following release from Asn with N-glycanase and reduction with NaBH4, were tested for their ability to interact with columns of L- and E-PHA-agarose. The characteristic elution position obtained for each oligosaccharide was reproducible and correlated with specific structural features. In virtually all cases, L- and E-PHA yielded identical results, indicating that their specificities for reduced oligosaccharides are similar. Both lectins retarded oligosaccharides bearing alpha 2,3- but not alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid. Desialylated oligosaccharides containing one, two, three, or four peripheral N-acetyllactosamine-type branches were retarded to varying extents by both lectins; however, this interaction was decreased or eliminated by removal of Gal. Desialylated oligosaccharides containing a bisecting GlcNAc residue attached to the beta-linked core Man displayed the greatest interaction with both lectins. Structures containing terminal sulfate or GalNAc did not interact with either lectin. In some instances, the specificities of L- and E-PHA lectins for free, reduced oligosaccharides differed from those established using glycopeptides. Therefore, the structural requirements for interaction with lectins such as L- and E-PHA must be fully and systematically defined using the appropriate authentic standards in order to use lectin affinity chromatography for the fractionation and characterization of free oligosaccharides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "E D", "Initials": "ED"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baenziger", "ForeName": "J U", "Initials": "JU"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM07200", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "HL07275", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R37-CA21923", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "leukoagglutinins, plants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "glycanase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3624245", "S0021-9258(18)45312-4"]}}]}
