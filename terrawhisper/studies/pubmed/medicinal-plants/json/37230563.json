To develop an efficient magnetic d-SPE method, magnetic adsorbent modified with magnesium oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-MgO) was prepared via layer-by-layer modification and used as cleanup adsorbent for removal of interferences that contain a large number of hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in the complex matrix. The obtained Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-MgO coupled with 3-(N,N-Diethylamino)-propyltrimethoxysilane (PSA) and octadecyl (C18) were used as d-SPE purification adsorbents and their dosages were systematically optimized with Paeoniae radix alba as the matrix model. Combined with SFC-MS/MS, rapid and accurate determination of 126 pesticide residues in the complex matrix was achieved. Further systematic method validation showed good linearity, satisfactory recovery, and wide applicability. The average recoveries of the pesticides at 20, 50, 80, and 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> were 110, 105, 108, and 109%, respectively. The proposed method was applied to complex medicinal and edible root plants, such as Puerariae lobate radix, Platycodonis radix, Polygonati odorati rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae radix, and Codonopsis radix. The average recoveries of the pesticides at 80\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> in these matrices were 106, 106, 105, 103, and 105%, respectively with an average relative standard deviation range of 8.24-10.2%. The results demonstrated the feasibility and wide matrix applicability of the proposed method, which is promising for pesticide residue analysis in complex samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
