In most cases, the disease is in a viral and post-viral form, which requires pathogenetic and symptomatic treatment. The study objective was to determine the efficacy of BNO 1012 extract in the technology of delayed antibiotic prescribing in children with acute rhinosinusitis.", "292 children aged 6 to 11\u202fyears with ARS were randomized in the multicenter, comparative study. They received an extract of five medicinal plants in addition to standard symptomatic therapy or standard therapy only. EVALUATION CRITERIA: reduction of the sinusitis severity according to a 4-point medical assessment scale (nasal congestion, severity of anterior and posterior rhinorrhea) at each visit, dynamics of self-scoring of rhinorrhea and headache (according to a 10-point visual analogue scale), \"therapeutic benefit\" in days, frequency of antibiotic prescriptions due to the use of an extract of five plants.", "The use of the 5-plant extract BNO 1012 in addition to the standard symptomatic treatment of acute rhinosinusitis provides a clinically significant, adequate reduction in the severity of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and post-nasal drip, assessed by a physician at V2 (p\u202f<\u202f0.005). Significant differences are noted in the patient's self-scoring of rhinorrhea on the second or third day in viral RS, and from the fourth to the eighth day in post-viral RS. Symptoms of similar intensity in control group were observed at V3. Thus, in the first week of treatment, the treatment group compared to the control one showed a \"therapeutic benefit\" of three days. The use of BNO 1012 in patients with acute rhinosinusitis can 1.81-fold reduce the prescription of antibacterial drugs.", "The combination of five medicinal plants is effective for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis in children aged 6 to 11\u202fyears.
