The kinetic absorption profiles were recorded at 360\u2009nm, which is concerned with the reaction between immobilized GO-g-PCA/DR and different concentrations of scopolamine.", "The nanosensor showed a rapid, strong, and stable response to the scopolamine solution with changing the absorption spectrum at 360\u2009nm. The reaction was completed in a period of 300\u2009s. The SEM, AFM, and FT-IR analysis of nanocomposites and nanosensors show the successful synthesis of GO-g-PCA/DR and the reaction between nanosensor and scopolamine. All experiments were performed at the wavelength of 360\u2009nm, room temperature, pH 7 (the scopolamine solution pH), and 300\u2009s. The nanosensor had a linear range of 0.65 to 19.63\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.025\u2009\u03bcg/mL as the limit of detection for scopolamine determination. In order to reuse the designed nanosensor, it was recovered with ethanol, and the color ultimately returned to its original state.", "This in situ nanosensor can determine the scopolamine in real samples with easy reversibility, extended lifetime, and reproducibility of the sensing phase response.", "A sensitive, precise, and fast response optical nanosensor is designed for in situ determination of scopolamine in real samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
