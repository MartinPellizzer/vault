The Talish patra (the leaves of Taxus buccata Linn.) and red ochre, 100 mg each, mixed with 2 cc distilled water was fed to fertility-tested albino rats on the first day of diaestrus phase. The second group of rats received only distilled water, 2 cc. The rats were allowed to mate with fertile male rats during their next estrus phase. In the first group of 25 rats, 10 rats delivered and 15 gave no birth to litters. In the second or control group, all 25 rats delivered. The number of pups per litter did not exceed more than 5 in the first group, while no rat gave birth to less than 4 in the second group; the average number delivered per litter in the treated group was 3.9 against 7 in the control group. It is concluded that the drug does have some antifertility affect."]}], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "PMID": "12275755", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "01", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "ArticleDate": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0022-4286", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "3", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1968"}}, "Title": "The Journal of research in Indian medicine", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Res Indian Med"}, "ArticleTitle": "Certain indigenous drugs as anti-fertility agents: an experimental study.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "49", "EndPage": "54", "MedlinePgn": "49-54"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tewari", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaturvedi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Res Indian Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0206036", "ISSNLinking": "0022-4286"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Laboratory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1968", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12275755"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
