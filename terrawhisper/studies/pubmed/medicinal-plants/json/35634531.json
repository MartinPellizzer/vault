This study aimed to design a startup-based learning model (SBL).", "As a qualitative research study, startup teams were formed by the pharmacy students of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in 2020. This model was used to train 120 students as pharmaceutical entrepreneurs through related lectures, simulations, and field activities. We employed this model for students to become familiar with the various stages of examining market needs, knowledge-based company registration, intellectual property, logo design, and even pharmaceutical product development. Students' feedback was assessed with a questionnaire designed by the team of researchers, and its results were used to analyze the course and improve the quality of the proposed model.", "Most of the studied indices revealed that the students rated this model as good or excellent. Satisfaction with more important indices includes student creativity and ideation in educational activity (60.7%), attractive presentation (60.4%), teamwork among learners (62.2%), appropriateness of evaluation method (65.4%), understanding how to make herbal remedies (49.1%), learner participation in the educational activity (74.8%), entrepreneurial motivation (60.7%), and applicability (64.4%).", "We found this model effective in boosting students' satisfaction, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. Lecturers also play a facilitator role in addition to specialized training. Therefore, in this model, both lecturers and students can grow more and make education more attractive. This study, for the first time, demonstrated that SBL could be applied in education systems and make the students more interested in educational content and help them to prepare for the job market."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Association of Indigenous Knowledge, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri-Ardekani", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Education Research Center, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarzi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hasan", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Education Research Center, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faghihi", "ForeName": "Seyed Aliakbar", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Badr", "ForeName": "Parmis", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarshenas", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mehdi", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abolhassanzadeh", "ForeName": "Zohreh", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Association of Indigenous Knowledge, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohagheghzadeh", "ForeName": "Abdolali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8104374", "ISSNLinking": "0253-0716"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Education, Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students, Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Shahiwala A.
