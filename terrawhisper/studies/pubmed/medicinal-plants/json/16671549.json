Synoviocytes were separated by incubation with collagenase and trypsin, and its ultrastructural changes were observed under transmission electron microscope. Synoviocyte proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazal-2yl) 2,5- diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay, and IL-1 activity in synoviocytes supernatant was measured by thymocyte proliferation assay. TNFa and PGE, produced by synoviocytes were determined by radioimmunoassay.", "TGP was shown to protect CIA rats against the ultrastructural damages of synoviocytes.
