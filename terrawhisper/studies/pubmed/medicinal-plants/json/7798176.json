In the present study, a peptide of 22 residue comprising the sequence of chain A1 from position 3 to 24 was synthesized by the solid-phase method. This synthetic peptide with six Cys residues contains a reactive site at position Lys11I-Ser12I (I denotes an inhibitor residue). Air oxidation and HPLC purification resulted in two antitrypsin active components, SPC1 and SPC2. Neither SPC1 nor SPC2 can stoichiometrically inhibit trypsin. The Ki values of SPC1 and SPC2 are 1.2 x 10(-7) and 4.0 x 10(-8) M, respectively. The complexes of SPC1 and SPC2 with bovine beta-trypsin (BTRY) were crystallized by ammonium sulphate precipitation at pH 6.4 and 6.0, respectively. The two crystals have the same crystal form with space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and cell dimension of a = 63.2(2) A, b = 63.5(6) A, and c = 69.8(4) A. The crystal structure of one complex, SPC1-BTRY, was determined and refined at 2.2 A resolution to a final R-value of 19.2%. From the resulting electron density map, 9 residues of SPC1, from position 9I to 17I, were identified clearly and three-dimension atomic model of the 9-residue reactive loop formed by a disulfide bridge, Cys9I-Cys17I, was built. No electron density corresponding to the other 13 residues was observed in the present map.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Folding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7798176", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124491"]}}]}
