And t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the true data and predictive value.", "The prediction model could be used to predict reducing sugar content in the powder of decoction pieces of Shu Dihuang stewing with mine. This method is feasible to determine reducing sugar content in Shu Dihuang with convenient operation. It can offer reference to contents determination of other Chinese crude drugs and Chinese patent medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Zhengzhou, 450008, China. white-yan@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhi-hong", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17326404"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
