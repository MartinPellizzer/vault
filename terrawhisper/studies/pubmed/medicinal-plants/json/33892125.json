A xero-halophyte Bassia indica is deemed to be a very cheap source of natural entities without chemical or biological investigation. In this context, a new acylated flavonol tetraglycoside, kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21926)-O-[\u03b2-D-galactopyranosyl-(1\u21923)-2-O-trans-feruloyl-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21922)]-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (14), together with rare occurring flavonol triglycoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21926)-O-[\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21922)]-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (15), were isolated from the aqueous methanol extract of the aerial parts of B. indica. The study also reported an optimal separation and characterization of a new seco-glycosidic oleanane saponin with 2'R,3'S stereocenters, identified as (2'R,3'S)-3-O-[2'-hydroxy-3'-(2\"-O-glycolyl)-oxo-propionic acid-\u03b2-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-olean-12-en-3\u03b2-ol-28-oic acid (17), in addition to its derivative, 3-O-[2'-(2\"-O-glycolyl)-glyoxylyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-olean-12-en-3\u03b2-ol-28-oic acid (16). The structures of all isolated compounds were elucidated based on 1D, 2D NMR, and HR-MS analysis, as well as comparing with similar derivatives published in the literature. Furthermore, thirteen known compounds were isolated and identified as \u03b2-sitosterol (1), vanillic acid (2), o-hydroxybenzoic acid (3), \u0440-hydroxybenzoic acid (4), 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (5), methyl caffeate (6), caffeic acid (7), quercetin (8), uracil (9), thymidine (10), tachioside (11), isorhamnetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (12), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (13). The anticholinesterase activity of all isolated compounds was evaluated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
