Natural products containing pharmacological activity are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in anticancer drugs, due to their diverse structures and distinctive functional groups that inspire new drug results by means of synthetic chemistry. Terrestrial medicinal plants have traditionally been the primary source for developing natural products (NPs). However, over the past thirty years, marine organisms such as invertebrates, plants, algae, and bacteria have revealed many new pharmaceutical compounds known as marine NPs. This field constantly evolves as a discipline in molecular targeted drug discovery, incorporating advanced screening tools that have revolutionised and become integral to modern antitumor research. This review discusses recent studies on new natural anticancer alkaloids obtained from marine organisms. The paper illustrates the structure and origin of marine alkaloids and demonstrates the cytotoxic action of new alkaloids from several structural families and their synthetic analogs. The most recent findings about the potential or development of some of them as novel medications, together with the status of our understanding of their current mechanisms of action, are also compiled."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1503-2745"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, 17km Stone, NH-2, Mathura-Delhi Road Mathura, Chaumuhan, Uttar Pradesh- 281406 (India)."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, 17km Stone, NH-2, Mathura-Delhi Road Mathura, Chaumuhan, Uttar Pradesh- 281406 (India)."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Surendra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, 17km Stone, NH-2, Mathura-Delhi Road Mathura, Chaumuhan, Uttar Pradesh- 281406 (India)."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Amit Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maya Institute of Pharmacy, Hathras, Uttar Pradesh 204101."}], "LastName": "Varshney", "ForeName": "Mayuri", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Disto Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd Unit 2, 209/A, Phase-3 IDA, Pashamaylaram Patancheru, Sangareddy, district, Hyderabad, Telangana 502307."}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Suchismita", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38918975", "10.2174/0113892010316791240611093022", "CPB-EPUB-141228"]}}]}
