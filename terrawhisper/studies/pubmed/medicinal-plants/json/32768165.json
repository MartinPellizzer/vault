Its biosynthesis pathway has attracted significant attention, but the regulation of CPT biosynthesis by the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors (TFs) remains unclear. In this study, a systematic analysis of the AP2/ERF TFs family in C. acuminata was performed, including phylogeny, gene structure, conserved motifs, and gene expression profiles in different tissues and organs (immature bark, cotyledons, young flower, immature fruit, mature fruit, mature leaf, roots, upper stem, and lower stem) of C. acuminata. A total of 198 AP2/ERF genes were identified and divided into five relatively conserved subfamilies, including AP2 (26 genes), DREB (61 genes), ERF (92 genes), RAV (18 genes), and Soloist (one gene). The combination of gene expression patterns in different C. acuminata tissues and organs, the phylogenetic tree, the co-expression analysis with biosynthetic genes, and the analysis of promoter sequences of key enzymes genes involved in CPT biosynthesis pathways revealed that eight AP2/ERF TFs in C. acuminata might be involved in CPT synthesis regulation, which exhibit relatively high expression levels in the upper stem or immature bark. Among these, four genes (CacAP2/ERF123, CacAP2/ERF125, CacAP2/ERF126, and CacAP2/ERF127) belong to the ERF-B2 subgroup; two genes (CacAP2/ERF149 and CacAP2/ERF152) belong to the ERF-B3 subgroup; and two more genes (CacAP2/ERF095 and CacAP2/ERF096) belong to the DREB-A6 subgroup. These results provide a foundation for future functional characterization of the AP2/ERF genes to enhance the biosynthesis of CPT compounds of C. acuminata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 China Pharmaceutical University.
