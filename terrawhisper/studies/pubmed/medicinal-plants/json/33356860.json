Plants have given and continue to give compounds with great efficiency and low toxicity, some of them being a starting point for extremely effective synthetic substances. Although herbal remedies are used mainly for preventive purposes, there are also guidelines issued by some countries that indicate the use of traditional remedies for different stages of COVID-19 disease.Europe has a long and strong tradition of using medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes, but clinical trials for this type of approach are scarce, compared to Asia. In this regard, a bridge between tradition and science, would have a strong impact on the capacity for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The paper reviews compounds of plant origin that have previously proven effective in counteracting some coronaviruses but also some of their major effects - direct action on virus replicative apparatus (viral entry or replication, action on the viral enzymatic system), collateral action of natural compounds on the immune system and also the contribution of herbal medicine as vaccine adjuvants are tackled."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnologies, National Institute for Chemical-Pharmaceutical R & D ICCF , Bucharest, Romania."}], "LastName": "Grigore", "ForeName": "Alice", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medicine Doctoral School/ Faculty of Pharmacy, Titu Maiorescu University , Bucharest, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Directorate of Pharmaceutical Inspection, National Agency for Medicines and Medical Device , Bucharest, Romania."}], "LastName": "Cord", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology , Bucharest, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Titu Maiorescu University , Bucharest, Romania."}], "LastName": "Tanase", "ForeName": "Cristiana", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnologies, National Institute for Chemical-Pharmaceutical R & D ICCF , Bucharest, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology , Bucharest, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Titu Maiorescu University , Bucharest, Romania."}], "LastName": "Albulescu", "ForeName": "Radu", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Immunoassay Immunochem", "NlmUniqueID": "100963688", "ISSNLinking": "1532-1819"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immune System"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Internalization"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33356860", "10.1080/15321819.2020.1862867"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
