ED has now become the most treated sexual disorder for men among young and old age groups due to varying physical and psychological factors. The treatment with synthetic Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are cost-effective but due to adverse effects such as priapism, loss of vision, heart attack and syncope, the daily life patterns of these patients are distressed and hence the need for alternative medicaments or sources are of utmost important. Therefore, the exploration of medicinal plants as PDE5 inhibitors will be worthwhile in tackling the problems as many plant extracts and fractions have been long used as aphrodisiacs and sexual stimulants which may be found to be active against PDE5 enzyme.", "To provide a review on the different medicinal herbs traditionally used as natural aphrodisiacs, libido or sexual enhancers which are proven for their PDE5 inhibitory effect.", "Ethnobotanical and scientific information was procured, reviewed and compiled from the literature search of electronic databases and search engines.", "A total of 97 medicinal plants exhibiting PDE5 inhibitory effect are reviewed in this paper which is supported by preclinical experimental evidence. Among them, 77 plants have been selected according to their traditional and ethnobotanical uses as aphrodisiacs and the rest are screened according to their effectiveness against predisposing factors responsible for ED and sexual dysfunction such as diabetes and hypertension or due to the presence of phytochemicals having structural similarity towards the identified natural PDE5 inhibitors. In addition, sixteen alkaloids, sixty-one phenolics and eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been isolated or identified from active extracts or fractions that are exhibiting PDE5 inhibitory activity. Among them, isoflavones and biflavones are the major active constituents responsible for action, where the presence of prenyl group for isoflavones; and the methoxy group at C-5 position of flavones are considered essential for the inhibitory effect. However, the prenylated flavonol glycoside, Icariin and Icariside II isolated from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim (hory goat weed) are the most effective inhibitor, till date from natural sources. Traditional medicines or formulations containing extracts of Ginkgo biloba L., Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex Baker, Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp., Eurycoma longifolia Jack and Vitis vinifera L. are also found to be inhibitors of PDE5 enzyme.", "The review suggests and supports the rational use of traditional medicines that can be further studied for the development of potential PDE5 inhibitors. Many traditional medicines are still used in various regions of Africa, Asia and South America that are poorly characterized and experimented. Despite the availability of a vast majority of traditional formulations as aphrodisiacs or sexual stimulants, there exists a need for systemic evaluation on the efficacy as well as the mechanism of action of the herbal constituents for the identification of novel chemical moieties that can be further developed for maximum efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
