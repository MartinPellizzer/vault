Then, the rats were decollated and the left ventricle were dyed by nitrotetrazolum blue chloride(NBT) to distinguish infraction area from non-infraction area. Myocardial infarction index was calculated accordingly to assess the effect of TFEB on myocardial ischemia. A piece of ventricular muscle come from apex of heart was dyed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe the degree of myocardial lesions by microscopic examination. Nitric oxide (NO) level in serum was measured to demonstrate the relevant mechanism.", "TFEB could markedly reduce the myocardial infraction index in a dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.05-0.01). Microscopic examination showed that the myocardium of sham group had no lesion in morphology and the muscle fiber kept integrity and the cardiac myocyte lined up in order. While control group displayed extensive swelling, rupture, confluent, even break in cardiac myocyte. TFEB could relieve the lesion degree of myocardium. NO level in serum after LAD ligation in TFEB 100 and 150 mg/kg groups was markedly reduced(P < 0.05-0.01).", "TFEB has protective effect on myocardial ischemia induced by LAD ligation in rats and can prevent against Xiongbi symptom, possibly via the decrease of NO level in serum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, Pharmacy College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310031."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Honggang", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Qiaojun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Honghai", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Yijia", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15058209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
