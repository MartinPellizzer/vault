The importance plant study arises from the fact that it has both medicinal and nutritional values. The plant were collected from Albaha mountains in Albaha area. The parts of the plant that were studied are stems and leaves. Spectrophotometric and proximate analysis showed that the percentage of moisture 7.24% and 7.12% for leaves and stems respectively, ash content 25.3% for leaves and 23.9% for the stems, while iron content for leaves and stems was 208.3 and 75.0mg/kg respectively, and for copper content both parts have the same amount which is 11.5mg/kg. Phtychemical analysis of the plant parts revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids and saponin content in both plant parts while tannins present in the leaves but absent in the stems. The results obtained from this study can be used to standardize different medicinal plants. Also the bioactive compounds found in the plant under study may be a source of investigations of promising herbal medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences and Arts at Baljurashi, Albaha University, Albaha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elgailani", "ForeName": "Isam Eldin Hussein", "Initials": "IEH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30150190"]}}]}
