In this paper, autophagy was measured by the lipid modification of light chain-3 (LC3) and the formation of autophagosomes. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometer analysis were used to measure apoptosis. The western blot analysis was used to examine the effects of CSPCs on the expression of LC3, PI3K, phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, Bcl-2, Bad, Bax, BID and cleaved caspase 3 in HepG2 cells. The results showed that 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and apoptosis inhibitor (Z-VAD) could inhibited the death of HepG2 induced by CSPCs for 48h (150\u03bcg/mL). CSPCs induced the accumulation of autophagosomes and microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3-II (LC3-II, a marker of autophagy). P-AKT, PI3K and mTOR were significantly decreased on CSPCs exposure. However, these phenomena were not observed in the group pretreated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and Z-VAD. CSPCs also induced the expression of Bad, Bax and Beclin-1 proteins and decreased the expression of Bcl-2, which was inhibited by 3-MA and Z-VAD. Moreover the apoptotic cell death could be inhibited by 3-MA. In addition, inhibition of LC3-II by siRNA-dependent knockdown attenuated the cleavage of caspase 3. These results suggested CSPCs could trigger autophagy via inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, enhanced apoptosis in HepG2 cells which may be associated with the mitochondria-dependent signaling way."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
