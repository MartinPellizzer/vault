Risk factors for bleeding events and supratherapeutic INR (at least 0.5 units above the target range) were evaluated longitudinally by using generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling. Of the 171 patients completing a diary, 87 (51%) reported at least one bleeding event and 36 (21%) had a supratherapeutic INR. Seventy-three patients (43%) indicated they had used at least one CAM product previously reported to interact with warfarin. Warfarin use of less than 3 months' duration was the only statistically significant risk factor identified for supratherapeutic INR. The CAM therapies associated with an increased risk of self-reported bleeding included cayenne, ginger, willow bark, St. John's wort, and coenzyme Q(10). Use of more than one CAM while receiving warfarin was also a significant risk factor. Two CAMs were independently associated with an increased risk of self-reported bleeding: coenzyme Q(10) (odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.88-7.24) and ginger (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.42-4.24). Other risk factors significantly associated with increased bleeding included high target INR (2.5-3.5), diarrhea, acetaminophen use, increased alcohol consumption, and increased age.", "The use of CAM by patients receiving warfarin is common, and consumption of coenzyme Q(10) or ginger appears to increase the risk of bleeding in this population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Department, Vancouver Coastal Health-Providence Health Care Pharmacy Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shalansky", "ForeName": "Stephen", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lynd", "ForeName": "Larry", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Richardson", "ForeName": "Kathryn", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ingaszewski", "ForeName": "Andrew", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kerr", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacotherapy", "NlmUniqueID": "8111305", "ISSNLinking": "0277-0008"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticoagulants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1339-63-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Ubiquinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5Q7ZVV76EI", "NameOfSubstance": "Warfarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EJ27X76M46", "NameOfSubstance": "coenzyme Q10"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anticoagulants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Canada"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Coenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Normalized Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Ubiquinone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Warfarin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17723077", "10.1592/phco.27.9.1237"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
