Aqueous extracts of A. africanus and C. miniata leaves have been shown to possess similar uterotonic activities in the isolated whole uterus preparation. The uterus however, comprises a myometrial and an endometrial layer and the activity of both oxytocin and the prostaglandins differs in these layers. The aim of this study was to determine the uterotonic activity of the herbal remedies in an endometrium-free preparation (i.e. \"stripped\" myometrium) and, if active, whether this effect could be related to prostaglandin synthesis or to interaction with specific receptors. The effects of the herbal extracts were tested on the isolated \"stripped\" rat myometrium preparation. Both herbal extracts caused a direct contractile response by the isolated tissue. Pretreatment of the myometrium with either plant extract augmented the initial response to acetylcholine. Preincubation with atropine inhibited the response to cumulative dosage of Agapanthus extract but had no effect on the response to Clivia. Indomethacin administration did not affect the response of the myometrium to cumulative dosage of acetylcholine, oxytocin or Clivia extract but inhibited the response to Agapanthus extract. These results clearly indicate that the Agapanthus and Clivia herbal extracts exhibited uterotonic activity in this model. The study illustrates that the \"stripped\" myometrium model has successfully differentiated between the mechanisms of action of two herbal oxytocics compared to the whole uterus preparation where their uterotonic activity was thought to be similar."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical School, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. djh.veale@icon.co.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veale", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Havlik", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50-56-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myometrium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10972206", "10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00719-0", "S0024320500007190"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
