Proteins from Lupinus albus are increasingly eaten in the form of seeds or additives to wheat flour. The risk of cross-allergenicity is still insufficiently known.", "We sought to study the risk of cross-allergy to lupine in patients allergic to peanut and to study lupine allergenicity.", "Twenty-four patients allergic to peanuts were studied by means of skin prick tests with native lupine flour from Lupinus albus. Double-blind oral challenge tests were performed with lupine flour and peanut in 8 of these patients. Specific IgEs were assayed for peanut, lupine flour, and pollen in 6 sera. RAST inhibition tests for lupine pollen by peanut were performed on 4 of these sera. Peanut and lupine flour immunoblots were carried out for 6 sera, and crossed immunoblot inhibitions for peanut by lupine flour and lupine flour by peanut were carried out for 2 sera.", "The skin prick test responses with lupine flour were positive in 11 (44%) subjects. The challenge test responses were positive in 7 of 8 subjects at the same doses as with peanut. The major lupine flour allergen (molecular mass, 43 kd) is present in peanuts. The RAST inhibition and immunoblot tests indicated cross-reactivity of peanut with the lupine flour and pollen.", "The risk of crossed peanut-lupine allergy is high, contrary to the risk with other legumes. The inclusion of 10% lupine flour in wheat flour without mandatory labeling makes lupine a hidden allergen, presenting a major risk of cross-reaction in subjects already allergic to peanut products. A high sensitizing potential can also be postulated for this legume."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, H\u00f4pital Central, Nancy, France."}], "LastName": "Moneret-Vautrin", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gu\u00e9rin", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kanny", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Flabbee", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fr\u00e9mont", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morisset", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10518837", "10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70303-9", "S0091-6749(99)70303-9"]}}]}
