The pathology of PD brain is characterized by inclusions of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) in the cytoplasmic region of neurons. Clinical evidence suggests that stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to neuroinflammation in the affected brain regions. Upon neuroinflammation, the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, and other transcription factors such as nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and toll-like receptors (TLRs) are upregulated and induce the microglial activation, contributing to PD via dopaminergic neuron autophagy. Aberrant activation or phosphorylation of the components of JAK/STAT signaling pathway has been implicated in increased transcription of the inflammation-associated genes and many neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and interleukine (IL)-6 are two of the most potent activators of the JAK/STAT pathway, and it was shown to be elevated in PD. Stimulation of microglial cell with aggregated \u03b1-SYN results in production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in PD. Dysregulation of the JAK/STAT in PD and its involvement in various inflammatory pathways make it a promising PD therapy approach. So far, a variety of synthetic or natural small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) have been found promising in managing a spectrum of ailments, many of which are in preclinical research or clinical trials. Herein, we provided a perspective on the function of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in PD progression and gathered data that describe the rationale evidence on the potential application of Jakinibs to improve neuroinflammation in PD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
