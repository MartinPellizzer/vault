Numerous <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments exhibited that oligosaccharides possess various activities, such as antitumor, anti-oxidation, modulate the gut microflora, anti-inflammatory, anti-infection, and immune-regulatory activities. Generally, biological activities are closely related to chemical structures, including molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, glycosidic bond connection, etc. The structural analysis of oligosaccharides is an important basis for studying their structure-activity relationship, but the structural diversity and complexity of carbohydrate compounds limit the study of oligosaccharides activities. Understanding the structures and biological functions of oligosaccharides is important for the development of new bioactive substances with natural oligosaccharides. This review provides a systematic introduction of the current knowledge of the chemical structures and biological activities of oligosaccharides. Most importantly, the reported chemical characteristics and biological activities of the famous TCHM oligosaccharides were briefly summarized, including <i>Morinda officinalis</i>, <i>Rehmannia glutinosa</i>, <i>Arctium lappa</i>, <i>Polygala tenuifolia</i>, <i>Panax ginseng</i>, <i>Lycium barbarum</i> and <i>Astragalus membranaceus</i>. TCHM oligosaccharides play an important role in nutrition, health care, disease diagnosis and prevention as well as have broad application prospects in the field of medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, 232 Waihuan East Road, Panyu District, Guangzhou 510006, P.
