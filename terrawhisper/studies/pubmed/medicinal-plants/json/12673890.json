The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the efficacy of Fun-boi against arthritis and its effect on the immune system.", "Mice were divided into the following 3 groups of 7 mice each: 1) a normal group, not treated to cause collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), received water orally; 2) a control group with CIA received water orally; and 3) the Fun-boi group with CIA, received Fun-boi (3 mg/g body weight/day) orally. We analyzed the arthritis score, the serum anti-type II collagen (CII) antibody level, and the percentage of the following lymphocyte subsets from lymphoid organs: B220, CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8 and CD40L/CD4 lymphocytes from blood or lymph nodes; and CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ from the thymus.", "Fun-boi therapy markedly reduced the severity of arthritis (p < 0.001) and tended to reduce the serum anti-CII antibody level (p = 0.06). Whereas CII immunization of DBA/1J mice caused a significant redistribution of CD3/CD8 lymphocytes from blood or lymph nodes, Fun-boi therapy caused significant normalization of the same types of lymphocyte subsets from lymph nodes, but did not affect the CD4 or CD4/CD40L lymphocyte subsets.", "These results demonstrate that Fun-boi therapy exerts therapeutic effects in CIA mice, possibly by causing immunomodulatory effects at specific sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Japanese Oriental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Toyama, Japan. niizawa@kmh.kanebo.co.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Niizawa", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kogure", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hai", "ForeName": "L X", "Initials": "LX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fujinaga", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terasawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Rheumatol", "NlmUniqueID": "8308521", "ISSNLinking": "0392-856X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen Type II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymph Nodes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Subsets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred DBA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stephania tetrandra"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12673890"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
