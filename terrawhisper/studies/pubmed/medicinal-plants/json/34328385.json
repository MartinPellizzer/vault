However, recently, heavy metal pollution has seriously affected the quality and safety of MPs. Consuming MPs polluted by heavy metals such as Pb, Hg, and Cu significantly threaten the health of consumers. To manage this situation, the levels of heavy metals in MPs must be controlled. In recent years, this field has attracted significant attention, but few researchers have systematically summarized various analytical methods. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate methods that can accurately and effectively detect the amount of heavy metals in MPs. Herein, some important analytical methods used to detect heavy metals in MPs and their applications have been introduced and summarized in detail. These include atomic absorption spectrometry, atomic fluorescence spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, and anodic stripping voltammetry. The characteristics of these methods were subsequently compared and analyzed. In addition, high-performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and disposable electrochemical sensors have also been used for heavy metal detection in MPs. To elucidate the systematic and comprehensive information, these methods have also been briefly introduced in this review."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Qiqihar Medical University, Qiqihar, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Chunyan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Science, Tianjin Agricultural University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Lijuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Qiqihar Medical University, Qiqihar, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuchao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Mingyue", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Erhuan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5366-8464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Qiqihar Medical University, Qiqihar, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Laboratory, Inner Mongolia Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hohhot, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Engineering Research Center of the Planting and Development of Astragalus Membranaceus of the Geoherbs, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Characteristic Geoherbs Resources Protection and Utilization, Baotou Medical College, Baotou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Minhui", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34328385", "10.1080/10408347.2021.1953371", "10.1080/10408347.2021.1953371"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
