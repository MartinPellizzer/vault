The transient receptor potential channels, including transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), are involved in various neurological disorders. We aimed to evaluate the effect of TRPA1 inhibition on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and physical dependence. For induction of CPP, morphine (10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg) was administrated for four consecutive days to male BALB/c mice. The effects of HC030031 (TRPA1 antagonist, 10, 25, and 50\u00a0mg/kg) on the expression and reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP were evaluated. For induction of physical dependence, morphine was injected three times a day for 3 days. Withdrawal-related behaviors such as jumping and defecation were precipitated by the administration of naloxone to morphine-dependent mice. The effect of HC030031 on jumping and defecation was assessed. The results showed that 20\u00a0mg/kg of morphine elicited a significant CPP. HC030031 reduced the expression of morphine CPP without any change in the locomotor activity. It also decreased the reinstatement of morphine CPP. HC030031 mitigated morphine withdrawal via reducing jumping and defecation. The present study demonstrated that HC030031 decreased morphine-associated CPP and physical dependence. It is presumed that TRPA1 has interaction with the main pharmacological effects of morphine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, 9177948954, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadian Salami", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, 9177948564, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavi", "ForeName": "Mohaddeseh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, 9177948954, Iran."}], "LastName": "Souri", "ForeName": "Mohammad Saeid", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5032-4263"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, 9177948954, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, 9196773117, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roohbakhsh", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-7H-purin-7-yl)-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)acetamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Purines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetanilides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Purines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetanilides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morphine Dependence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36223654", "10.1139/cjpp-2022-0333"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
