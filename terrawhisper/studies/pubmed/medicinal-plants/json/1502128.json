This was demonstrated by enzymatic protein hydrolysis of flour of germinated faba and soya beans, using a pepsin-pancreatin enzyme system. SDS-PAGE was used to study the changes in protein pattern of these legumes during germination. In addition, the effect of germination on the content of condensed tannins in flour from germinated faba beans and trypsin inhibitors in flour from germinated soya beans were studied. Germination for five days resulted in a maximum increase in enzymatic protein hydrolysis by 21.3% in flour from faba beans and by 25.7% in flour from soya beans after 12 hours of germination. Protein patterns, obtained with SDS-PAGE demonstrated a considerable protein breakdown during germination between day 2 and 3 in faba beans and between day 1 and 2 in soya beans. The tannin content in flour from faba beans decreased by 29.7% after seven days of germination, but the tannin content of the hulls of the faba beans did not change during that period of germination. The trypsin inhibitors in flour from soya beans decreased by 25.5% after seven days of germination. We conclude that the increased enzymatic hydrolysis of protein in both legumes cannot be explained by a decrease of tannins or trypsin inhibitors. The possible explanation is that through degradation of proteins during germination of the legumes, the cleaved protein fragments are more susceptible for hydrolysis by pepsin-pancreatin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Nutrition, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Savelkoul", "ForeName": "F H", "Initials": "FH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boer", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tamminga", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schepers", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elburg", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1988 Apr;170(1):203-8", "ArticleIdList": ["3389511"]}, {"Citation": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 1986;24(4):401-49", "ArticleIdList": ["3536314"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1982 Aug;70(2):493-7", "ArticleIdList": ["16662522"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1988 Oct;88(2):355-60", "ArticleIdList": ["16666307"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1992 Jan;42(1):71-85", "ArticleIdList": ["1372122"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1502128", "10.1007/BF02193935"]}}]}
