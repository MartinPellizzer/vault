Numerous studies suggest that P. perfoliatum extract elicits significant anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral effects. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of its anti-liver cancer effects remain poorly understood. Our study suggests that P. perfoliatum stem extract (PPLA) has a favorable safety profile and exhibits a significant anti-liver cancer effect both in vitro and in vivo. We identified that PPLA activates the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and key regulatory genes including ADRA1B, PLCB2, PRKG2, CALML4, and GLO1 involved in this activation. Moreover, PPLA modulates the expression of genes responsible for the cell cycle. Additionally, we identified four constituents of PPLA, namely taxifolin, myricetin, eriodictyol, and pinocembrin, that plausibly act via the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PPLA, along with its constituting compounds taxifolin, myricetin, and eriodictyol, exhibit potent anti-cancer activities and hold the promise of being developed into therapeutic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
