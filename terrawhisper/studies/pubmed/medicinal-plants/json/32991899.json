This has persuaded us to design and synthesis of a novel Ag NPs decorated biguanidine-chitosan (Bigua-CS) dual biomolecular functionalized core-shell type magnetic nanocomposite (Ag/Bigua-CS@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Bigua-CS could be introducing polysaccharide materials as potential coating agent to immobilizing and stabilizing metal nanoparticles. The material was characterized using several advanced techniques like fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic mapping, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Towards the chemical applications of the material, we headed the multicomponent synthesis of diverse propargylamines by A<sup>3</sup> coupling in water, which ended up with excellent yields. Due to strong paramagnetism, the catalyst was easily isolable and reused in 9cycles without any leaching and considerable change in reactivity. In addition, the catalyst was engaged in biological assays like study of anti-oxidant properties by DPPH mediated free radical scavenging test using BHT as a reference molecule. Thereafter, on having a significant IC<sub>50</sub> value in radical scavenging assay, we extended the bio-application of the catalyst in anticancer study of adenocarcinoma cells of human lungs. The three different cancer cell lines, PC-14, LC-2/ad and HLC-1 were used in this regard. The best result was achieved in the case of PC-14 cell line with strong IC<sub>50</sub> values."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
