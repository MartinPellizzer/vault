Black bean protein was extracted with the following solvents: distilled water, 0.01 M sodium hydroxide, 0.05 M sodium chloride, and 70% ethanol. By using each solvent under different conditions, it was possible to establish the optimum ones for the best extraction and fractionation of proteins from leguminous seeds. These conditions were the following: one hour agitation at room temperature, three successive extractions with the same solvent, and a ratio of solid to solvent of 1:20 W/V. The effect of 24 different sequences of solvents upon the extraction of protein was also investigated. From the extraction point of view, the best sequence of solvents for extracting the protein was that where NaOH constituted the first solvent used; this sequence, however, has the disadvantage of extracting all the protein from the seed, making it impossible to separate other protein fractions by another solvent. If the purpose of the extraction is to separate different protein fractions, the best sequence of solvents is distilled water or sodium chloride in the first place, followed by ethanol and sodium hydroxide. The need for using standardized methodology for the fractionation of protein from seeds in order to obtain comparable data between research laboratories is emphasized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez-Brenes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "E I", "Initials": "EI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Braham", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Effecto de varios solventes sobre la extracci\u00f3n de las fracciones prote\u00ednicas del frijol (Phaseolus vulgaris)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "55X04QC32I", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Hydroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6675547"]}}]}
