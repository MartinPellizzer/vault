When isolated vacuolar H+-ATPase was subjected to hydrostatic pressure, the activity of ATP hydrolysis was markedly inhibited in a time-, protein concentration- and pressure-dependent manner. The pressure treatment decreased both Vmax and Km of solubilized vacuolar H+-ATPase, implying an increase in ATP binding affinity, but a decrease in the ATP hydrolysis activity. Physiological substrate, Mg2+-ATP, augmented the loss of enzymatic activity upon pressure treatment. However, ADP, AMP, and Pi exerted substantial protective effects against pressurization. Steady-state ATP hydrolysis was more sensitive to pressurization than single-site ATPase activity. The inactivation of solubilized vacuolar H+-ATPase by pressure may result from changes in protein-protein interaction. The conformational change of solubilized vacuolar H+-ATPase induced by hydrostatic pressure was further determined by spectroscopic techniques. The inhibition of vacuolar H+-ATPase under pressurization involved at least two steps. Taken together, our work indicates that subunit-subunit interaction is crucial for the integrity and the function of plant vacuolar H+-ATPase. It is also suggested that the assembly of the vacuolar H+-ATPase complex is probably not random, but follows a sequestered pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kao-Hsiung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Y R", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Protein Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "8217321", "ISSNLinking": "0277-8033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.3.14", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Vacuoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9535278", "10.1023/a:1022535701279"]}}]}
