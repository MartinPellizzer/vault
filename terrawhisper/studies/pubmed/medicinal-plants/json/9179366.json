In vitro studies showed that a fermented mistletoe extract derived from Viscum album L. grown on pine trees was less cytotoxic to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) than other preparations. This finding could be related to its very low content of mistletoe lectins. Furthermore, this extract stimulated PBMC from healthy and especially allergic donors who had never received any mistletoe treatment. By analysing these in vitro reactions, an involvement of CD4+ T helper cells and CD14+ monocytes/macrophages was observed, suggesting an interaction of the specific and nonspecific immune system. In the supernatants of stimulated PBMC from healthy individuals, type-1 (interferon-gamma and interleukin-2) and type-2 (interleukin-4 and interleukin-5) associated cytokines were detected in about 20%. In patients with colorectal tumours, however, reduced frequency, suggesting a functional impairment of certain immunocompetent cells in these patients. These studies may help to evaluate properties of the natural and the specific immune system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Stein", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berg", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "9100823", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, CD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "75882-01-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Helixor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BK9092J5MP", "NameOfSubstance": "viscum album peptide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukocyte Common Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, CD"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunocompetence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Common Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9179366", "10.1097/00001813-199704001-00009"]}}]}
