Compound 3d exhibited remarkable neuroprotective effect and hepatoprotective activity. In addition, compound 3d presented favourable blood-brain barrier penetration in\u00a0vitro and drug-like property. Further, the in\u00a0vivo assay displayed that 3d indicated remarkable dyskinesia recovery rate and response efficiency on AD zebrafish, and exhibited surprising protective effect on A\u03b2<sub>1-40</sub>-mediated zebrafish vascular injury. More importantly, 3d did not indicate obvious acute toxicity at dose up to 2000\u00a0mg/kg, and could improve scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Subsequently, the regulation of multi-targets for 3d were further confirmed through transcriptome sequencing of brain hippocampi, which also offered novel potential targets and opened a new way to treat Alzheimer's disease. More interestingly, the metabolism of 3din\u00a0vitro indicated that 4 metabolites in rat liver microsome metabolism, 2 metabolites in human liver microsome metabolism, and 4 metabolites in intestinal flora metabolism, which offered supports for the preclinical study of 3d. Overall, this study exhibited that compound 3d was a promising advanced compound targeted multiple factors associated with AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
