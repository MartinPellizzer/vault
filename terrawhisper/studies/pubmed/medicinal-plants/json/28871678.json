Then according to the methods described in the Appendix of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010 edition), the sulfuric acid-phenol method was applied to determine the content of polysaccharide, and the water, ash and insoluble matter in water inspections were carried out and the control medicinal herb was identified with the samples by qualitative TLC. The results indicated that \u2460 the toxic effects (LD\u2085\u2080) of mice was 56.73 g\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9 by oral administration of Brassicea Radix extract, while Dm and Dn were respective 86.80 g\u2022kg\u2022d\u207b\u00b9 and 35.55 g\u2022kg\u2022d\u207b\u00b9;\u2461the determined effective dosage of Brassicea Radix extract which could enhance anoxia endurance was 0.388 g\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9\u2022d\u207b\u00b9; \u2462 the methods of TLC and the content of polysaccharide were established. The method of quality control has been recorded in Sichuan Province Standard for Tibetan Medicine, which is reliable, accurate and simple, with good reproducibility. Meanwhile, given the prominent effect on anti-hypoxia and good safety, it provided important basis for clinic safe and effective usage and the development of health products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Xian-Rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Jia-Li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yi-Long", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28871678", "10.4268/cjcmm20160408"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
