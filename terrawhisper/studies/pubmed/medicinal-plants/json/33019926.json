It can be divided into melanoma and non-melanoma cancer, which comprise mainly squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Although conventional therapies have ameliorated the management of skin cancer, the search for chemopreventive compounds is still the most effective and safer strategy to treat cancer. Nowadays, chemoprevention is recognized as a novel approach to prevent or inhibit carcinogenesis steps with the use of natural products. Crude extracts of plants and isolated phytocompounds are considered chemopreventive agents since they harbor anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-oncogenic properties against many types of diseases and cancers. In this review, we will discuss the therapeutic effect and preventive potential of selected medicinal plants used as crude extracts or as phytocompounds against melanoma and non-melanoma cutaneous cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon."}], "LastName": "El-Harakeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Stem Cell Research and Regenerative Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112, United States."}], "LastName": "Al-Ghadban", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology, and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon."}], "LastName": "Safi", "ForeName": "R\u00e9mi", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Basal Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33019926", "10.2174/1389450121666201005103521", "CDT-EPUB-110431"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
