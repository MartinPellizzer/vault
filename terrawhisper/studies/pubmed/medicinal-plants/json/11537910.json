This zone is called the postmitotic isodiametric growth (PIG) zone and consists of cells which have ceased dividing and are expanding isodiametrically. Upon gravistimulation cells along the upper side of the PIG zone begin elongating rapidly and this accounts for much of the early growth asymmetry. There is rapid (< 30 s) hyperpolarization of cells on the upper side of the PIG zone as well as rapid uptake of potassium from the stele. We propose that there is a relationship between the rate of hydrogen ion efflux and the extent of membrane hyperpolarization in the PIG zone and that such changes in potential are an early indication of impending changes in growth performance. Although the development of auxin asymmetry in the cap and its transmission to the elongating region is considered to be the controlling factor in root gravitropism, auxin asymmetry in the cap develops only after 30 min, about the same as the lag before initiation of curvature. Although this dilemma may be partly resolved by the location of the PIG zone close to the cap, alternative explanations such as gravi-detection by the PIG zone or very rapid (electrical?) signal transmission from the cap to the PIG zone need to be considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210."}], "LastName": "Ishikawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Adv Space Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9878935", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1177"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophysiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravity Sensing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11537910", "10.1016/0273-1177(94)90396-4"]}}]}
