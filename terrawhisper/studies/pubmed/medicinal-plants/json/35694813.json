Factors such as high costs, pharmacological side effects, and the development of drug resistance strains require the development of new and potentially effective antiviral to treat the various stages of Hepatitis C. Bioactive chemicals have been extracted from medicinal plants and are utilized by humans for the goal of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The goal of this work is to recognize phytochemicals from <i>Eclipta alba</i> and assess their potentiality activity against the hepatitis C virus envelope glycoprotein using <i>in silico</i> approaches. Phytochemicals from <i>Eclipta alba</i> were virtually screened by Auto dock raccoon and 12 compounds were selected for molecular docking to probe the active binding site. The top two compounds based on the binding score like ecliptalbine and oleanolic acid with HCV E2 glycoprotein exhibit binding energy -8.88 and -8.02\u2009kcal/mol, respectively. The chemicals' usefulness was reinforced by positive pharmacokinetic data. The phytocompounds were identified as potent HCV inhibitors based on the drug likeness and ADMET properties. Both ecliptalbine and oleanolic acid underwent molecular dynamics simulations to determine features such as RMSD, RMSF, SASA, hydrogen-bond number, and MM-PBSA-based binding free energy. From the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that oleanolic acid obtained from <i>Eclipta alba</i> can be used as inhibitors against Hepatitis C. The identified inhibitor from our study will be study <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> studies to check their efficacy against Hepatitis C.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
