This study is devoted to isolate nanobacteria from patients with active urolithiasis and investigate the in vitro and in vivo antinanobacterial activity of some antibiotics alone or in combination with extracts of irradiated herbs from certain medicinal plants. Nanobacteria were detected using scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy,\u00a0protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and DNA profile. The antimicrobial susceptibility of some biofilm-producing nanobacterial isolates was evaluated. The effect of medicinal plant extracts on growth was tested. A combination treatment between the most potent extracts and antibiotics was tested on biofilm production, protein profile, release of 260\u2009nm absorbing material, protein content, and ultrastructure of the strongest biofilm producers. In vivo study of nanobacteria and its treatment by the most potent agents was evaluated on male rats. Renal function was measured in serum; histological examination and oxidative stress parameters were determined in kidney tissues. Results showed that streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and water extracts of irradiated khella at 6\u2009kGy had antinanobacterial activity. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of the aqueous extract of irradiated Khella and doxycycline showed higher inhibition activity on microbial growth and biofilm production. They affected dramatically the strength of its cell membrane and subsequently its ultrastructure. Moreover, these results are confirmed by ameliorations in renal function and histological alterations. It could be concluded that the combination of DO and an aqueous extract of irradiated khella has an antinephrotoxic effect against nanobacteria-induced renal toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Radiation Research, Atomic Energy Authority, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Fayez", "ForeName": "Nora", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Ain shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Mohamed Khaled", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Radiation Research, Atomic Energy Authority, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farrag", "ForeName": "Hala Abdullah", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2908-6488"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Radiation Research, Atomic Energy Authority, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Marwa Abd El Hameed", "Initials": "MAEH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Radiation Research, Atomic Energy Authority, National Center for Radiation Research and Technology (NCRRT), Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Tablawy", "ForeName": "Seham Yousef El", "Initials": "SYE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cell Biochem Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "8305874", "ISSNLinking": "0263-6484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcifying Nanoparticles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N12000U13O", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxycycline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcifying Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Doxycycline"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Calculi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Collins CE.
