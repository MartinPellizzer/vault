Rapid determination and novel optimisation method for berberine extraction has been developed by Soxhlet extraction utilising central composite design-response surface methodology (CCD-RSM). Berberine was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the highest yield (13.39%) was obtained by maintaining optimal extraction conditions i.e., extraction time (7.28\u2009hrs), ethyl alcohol (52.21%) and solvent to sample ratio (21.78 v/w). Investigation of two geographic regions (Ramnagar and Srinagar) showed high berberine content in lower altitude. This novel optimisation technique has placed berberine as a potential candidate for developing pharmaceutical products for human health care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1707-778X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "cGMP-Chemical Engineering Division and Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Katare", "ForeName": "Anil Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2677-3346"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Sciences (Biodiversity and Applied Botany Division) and Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bikarma", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environment Technology Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Pooja", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Services Division, Indra Gandhi National Open University, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Sandeep", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bishander", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "cGMP-Chemical Engineering Division and Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Yalamanchili", "ForeName": "Kavya", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "cGMP-Chemical Engineering Division and Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Kulshrestha", "ForeName": "Nitin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources and Agrotechnology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India."}], "LastName": "Bhanwaria", "ForeName": "Rajendra", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Ujjain Engineering College, Ujjain, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ashok Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Ujjain Engineering College, Ujjain, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Sarita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Communication Technology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.
