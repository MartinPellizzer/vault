The aim of our work was to examine the antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of ethanol extracts of five medicinal plants for the purpose of their possible use in the treatment of T2D.", "The polyphenolic profile of the plant extracts was analyzed by Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography with a diode array detector configured with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UHPLC/DAD/(-)HESI-MS<sup>2</sup>). In vitro antidiabetic activity of extracts was determined by measuring the percentage of \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition. The antioxidant activity of the extract was determined by different spectrophotometric methods, while the antimicrobial activity was determined by agar dilution and disc diffusion methods.", "A. eupatoria extract contains the highest percentage of flavonoids (94%, with isoquercetin, vitexin, and rutin as the most abundant) in relation to the concentration of total phenolic compounds and exhibits excellent antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity. S. officinalis extract contains 60% flavonoids (predominately cirsimaritin and epigallocatechin gallate) and 40% phenolic acids (with rosmarinic acid being the most abundant from this group) and exhibits weak antidiabetic activity, significant antioxidant activity, and excellent antibacterial activity. A 45% percentage of flavonoids (with isoquercetin as the most abundant one) and 55% of phenolic acids (with ferulic acid as the most abundant) were measured in the extract of T. pratense, which had excellent antidiabetic activity but weaker antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. A similar percentage of flavonoids (52%, with epigallocatechin gallate in the highest concentration) and phenolic acids (48%, with chlorogenic acid as the most abundant) was measured in the extract of C. intybus which showed moderate antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. The extract of V. minor was the richest in phenolic acids (80%, with the most abundant chlorogenic acid), which resulted in weaker antidiabetic and antioxidant activities (except for Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelating ability) and antimicrobial activity.", "The results indicate that specific phenolic compounds are responsible for the different biological activities of the plant extracts. Among the investigated plants, the extract of A. eupatoria has the greatest potential for applications in the treatment of T2D."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
