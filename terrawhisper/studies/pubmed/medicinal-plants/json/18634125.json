From the normalized peak areas obtained from GC/MS and LC/MS and peak heights from (1)H NMR, statistical analyses were used in the identification of potential biomarkers. Metabolic profiling by GC/MS provided a different set of quantitative signatures of metabolites that can be used to characterize the molecular changes in human urine samples. A comparison of normalized metabonomics data for selected metabolites in human urine samples in the presence of potential overlapping peaks after tea ingestion from LC/MS and (1)H NMR showed the reliability of the current approach and method of normalization. The close agreements of LC/MS with (1)H NMR data showed that the effects of ion suppression in LC/MS for early eluting metabolites were not significant. Concurrently, the specificity of detecting the stated metabolites by (1)H NMR and LC/MS was demonstrated. Our data showed that a number of metabolites involved in glucose metabolism, citric acid cycle and amino acid metabolism were affected immediately after the intake of green tea. The proposed approach provided a more comprehensive picture of the metabolic changes after intake of green tea in human urine. The multiple analytical approach together with pattern recognition tools is a useful platform to study metabolic profiles after ingestion of botanicals and medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, Republic of Singapore 117543."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Law", "ForeName": "Wai Siang", "Initials": "WS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Pei Yun", "Initials": "PY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Eng Shi", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Choon Nam", "Initials": "CN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Sam Fong Yau", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pasikanti", "ForeName": "Kishore Kumar", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Eric Chun Yong", "Initials": "EC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Urinalysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18634125", "10.1002/rcm.3629"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
