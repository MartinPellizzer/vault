The palms of the Astrocaryum genus are examples of crops occurring in Central and South America, including the large plant life in Brazil. Although not very well known, the Astrocaryum spp. possess edible and non-edible fractions with potential technological and medicinal uses, as evidenced by recent research. Two native Brazilian fruits, tucum\u00e3-do-Amazonas (Astrocaryum aculeatum) and tucum\u00e3-do-Par\u00e1 (Astrocaryum vulgare), typically found in the north and northeast of the country, respectively, stand out for their high antioxidant capacity and rich content in bioactive compounds, mainly carotenoids and phenolic compounds. Accordingly, experimental studies indicate their potential to prevent and treat inflammatory and oxidative stress-related conditions, including cancer. The tucum\u00e3 plants have also been suggested as tools in the industry, for example for biofuel production, activated carbon technology, and as alternative packaging. Considering the importance of bringing light to underestimated yet culturally relevant native crops with potential benefits for small and large communities, this review aims to present and discuss the characteristics, bioactive composition, health effects, and technological potential of tucum\u00e3-do-Amazonas and tucum\u00e3-do-Par\u00e1 fruits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
