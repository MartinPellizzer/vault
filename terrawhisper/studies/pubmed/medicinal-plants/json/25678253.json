The objective of this study was to develop a sensitive and efficient liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for quantitative determination of 20 active constituents, including three iridoid glycosides, 11 flavonoids, three anthraquinones and three tannins in ZZDHD. Separation was achieved on a phenomenex kinetex C18 column (150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 2.6 \u00b5m) using gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. Detection was performed with electrospray ionization source in the negative ionization and selected ion monitoring mode. The established method was validated by determining the linearity (r(2) \u2265 0.9983), limit of quantification (0.16-300 ng/mL), precision (RSD \u2264 4.6%), average recovery (96.0-105.6%), repeatability (RSD \u2264 3.2%) and stability (RSD \u2264 4.5%). Then, the method was successfully applied to investigate the chemical composition variations owing to the interaction between the four component herbs of ZZDHD during the extraction process. It was found that different combinations of the herbs affect the extraction efficiency of chemical constituents in different ways. The validated LC-MS method provides a meaningful basis for quality control and further research on ZZDHD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Materia Medica, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Ran", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Kaishun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jilin Medical College, Jilin, 132001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Heyun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Kelin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fenrong", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25678253", "10.1002/bmc.3438"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
