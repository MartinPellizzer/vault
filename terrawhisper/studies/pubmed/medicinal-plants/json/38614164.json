Polysaccharides, as one of the most important bioactive components in Lilium, offer various health benefits. Recently, polysaccharides from Lilium plants have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their diverse biological properties including immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-aging and anti-radiation effects. However, the limited comprehensive understanding of polysaccharides from Lilium plants has hindered their development and utilization. This review focuses on the extraction, purification, structural characteristics, biological activities, structure-activity relationships, applications, and relevant bibliometrics of polysaccharides from Lilium plants. Additionally, it delves into the potential development and future research directions. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive understanding of polysaccharides from Lilium plants and to serve as a basis for further research and development as therapeutic agents and multifunctional biomaterials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
