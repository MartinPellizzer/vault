However, the adverse effects of these combinations on the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. We aimed investigate whether Hydroxychloroquine (HD), Azithromycin (AZ), and Ivermectin (IV) used in combination for the treatment of COVID-19, can lead to the development of gastrointestinal disorders. This is a systematic review and network meta-analysis conducted using Stata and Revman software, respectively. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023372802). A search of clinical trials in Cochrane Library databases, Embase, Web of Science, Lilacs, PubMed, Scopus and Clinicaltrials.gov conducted on November 26, 2023. The eligibility of the studies was assessed based on PICO criteria, including trials that compared different treatments and control group. The analysis of the quality of the evidence was carried out according to the GRADE. Six trials involving 1,686 COVID-19 patients were included. No trials on the association of HD or AZ with IV met the inclusion criteria, only studies on the association between HD and AZ were included. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and increased transaminases were related. The symptoms of vomiting and nausea were evaluated through a network meta-analysis, while the symptom of abdominal pain was evaluated through a meta-analysis. No significant associations with these symptoms were observed for HD, AZ, or their combination, compared to control. Low heterogeneity and absence of inconsistency in indirect and direct comparisons were noted. Limitations included small sample sizes, varied drug dosages, and potential publication bias during the pandemic peak. This review unveils that there are no associations between gastrointestinal adverse effects and the combined treatment of HD with AZ in the management of COVID-19, as compared to either the use of a control group or the administration of the drugs individually, on the other hand, highlighting the very low or low certainty of evidence for the evaluated outcomes. To accurately conclude the absence of side effects, further high-quality randomized studies are needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center (NPPM), Post-graduation Program in Pharmacology, Federal University of Piau\u00ed, Teresina, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pacheco", "ForeName": "Gabriella", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Biodiversity Research Center (BIOTEC), Post-graduation Program in Biotechnology, Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Lopes", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9 Luis Fernandes", "Initials": "ALF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Ana Patr\u00edcia de", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Corr\u00eaa", "ForeName": "Wendson de Ribamar Machado", "Initials": "WRM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Biodiversity Research Center (BIOTEC), Post-graduation Program in Biotechnology, Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Lima", "ForeName": "Lucas Daniel Batista", "Initials": "LDB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Cear\u00e1 (UFC), Fortaleza, CE, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Marcellus Henrique Loiola Ponte de", "Initials": "MHLP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Biodiversity Research Center (BIOTEC), Post-graduation Program in Biotechnology, Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Institute of Maranh\u00e3o (IFMA), Araioses, MA, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Teles", "ForeName": "Ariel Soares", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Biodiversity Research Center (BIOTEC), Post-graduation Program in Biotechnology, Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Nicolau", "ForeName": "Lucas Antonio Duarte", "Initials": "LAD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7234-3382"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center (NPPM), Post-graduation Program in Pharmacology, Federal University of Piau\u00ed, Teresina, PI, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Biodiversity Research Center (BIOTEC), Post-graduation Program in Biotechnology, Parna\u00edba Delta Federal University (UFDPar), Parna\u00edba, PI, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Medeiros", "ForeName": "Jand Venes Rolim", "Initials": "JVR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review", "Meta-Analysis", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914275", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8444"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "83905-01-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Azithromycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4QWG6N8QKH", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxychloroquine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70288-86-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ivermectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Azithromycin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxychloroquine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Network Meta-Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ivermectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38860720", "10.1080/10408444.2024.2348169"]}}]}
