As a natural compound, noscapine has several anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of noscapine against a rat model of tendinopathy. We created a surgical rat model of Achilles tendon damage to emulate tendinopathy. Briefly, an incision was made on the Achilles tendon, and it was then sutured using an absorbable surgical thread. Immediately, the injured area was topically treated with the vehicle, noscapine (0.2, 0.6, and 1.8\u00a0mg/kg), or dexamethasone (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) as a positive control. During the 19-day follow-up period, animals were assessed for weight, behavior, pain, and motor coordination testing. On day 20th, the rats were sacrificed, and the tendon tissue was isolated for macroscopic scoring, microscopic (H&E, Masson's trichrome, Ki67, p53) analyses, and cytokine secretion levels. The levels of macroscopic parameters, including thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical and cold allodynia, deterioration of motor coordination, tendon adhesion score, and microscopic indices, namely histological adhesion, vascular prominence and angiogenesis, and Ki67 and p53 levels, as well as fibrotic and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, VEGF) were significantly increased in the vehicle group compared to the sham group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05-0.001 for all cases). In contrast, the administration of noscapine (0.2, 0.6, and 1.8\u00a0mg/kg) attenuated the pain, fibrosis, and inflammatory indices in a dose-dependent manner compared to the vehicle group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05-0.001). Histological research indicated that noscapine 0.6 and 1.8\u00a0mg/kg had the most remarkable healing effects. Interestingly, two higher doses of noscapine had impacts similar to those of the positive control group in both clinical and paraclinical assessments. Taken together, our findings suggested that noscapine could be a promising medicine for treating tendinopathies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
