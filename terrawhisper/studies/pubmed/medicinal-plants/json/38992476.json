The main keyword \"Myrsine\" was used alone or in combination with others to search for references.", "Chromatographic procedure of Myrsine extracts led to the purification of 134 compounds. Flavonoids, mono-phenols, saponins, quinones, megastigmanes, and lignans were the main phytochemical classes. Myrsine Volatile compounds are monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and aliphatic compounds. Myrsine constituents established a widespread panel of pharmacological activities, such as cytotoxicity, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-parasite, tyrosine inhibition, and hepatoprotection, especially anti-inflammation. Novel flavonoids myrsininones A-B are better than the standard triclosan against bacteria Staphylococcus warneri, S. mutan, S. sanguis, and Actinomyces naeslundii.

Generally, Myrsine plant extracts showed no toxicity.", "Myrsine constituents are good antimicrobial, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory agents.
