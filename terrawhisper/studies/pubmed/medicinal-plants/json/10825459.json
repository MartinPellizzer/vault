Research on echinacea, including clinical trials, is limited and largely in German. More information is needed before a definitive statement about the efficacy of echinacea can be made. Future work needs to clearly identify the species of echinacea and distinguish between the efficacy of the different plant parts (roots versus upper plant parts). Although many of the active compounds of echinacea have been identified, the mechanism of action is not known, nor is the bioavailability, relative potency, or synergistic effects of the active compounds known. Interpretation of existing literature suggests that echinacea should be used as a treatment for illness, not as a means for prevention of illness. The consensus of the studies reviewed in this article is that echinacea is indeed effective in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms, but that this effect is noted only with certain preparations of echinacea. Studies show that the plant and its active components affect the phagocytic immune system, but not the specifically acquired immune system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, The University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. ssp@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Percival", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "26"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10825459", "10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00413-x", "S0006-2952(99)00413-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
