Aiming to facilitate chemical characterization and novel natural products discovery, the present study proposed an integrated approach based on two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (2D LC/Q-Orbitrap MS). An offline comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) LC system was constructed to cover and separate multi-type constituents by combining hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and conventional reversed phase C18. A two-step mass defect filtering-induced exclusion list-data dependent acquisition was developed to increase MS/MS coverage and selectivity. Additionally, an efficient interpretation strategy, combining an automatic matching algorithm and molecular networking (MN), was introduced for rapid recognition of known compounds and efficient elucidation of unreported ones. As a case study, the integrated approach was tentatively applied for comprehensive characterization of complex multi-type components in Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF), a traditional Chinese medicine. Consequently, a total of 537 compounds were characterized from LJF, including a large number of potential novel structures. It was demonstrated that the integrated approach is powerful in deep investigation on chemical diversity of medicinal plants and discovery of novel structures. Its application could also be extended for global profiling of other complicated chemical systems, such as Chinese medicinal formulas."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
