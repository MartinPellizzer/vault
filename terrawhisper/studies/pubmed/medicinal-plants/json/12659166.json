Several human studies have shown that plant sterols/stanols significantly reduce plasma total and LDL cholesterol. In this article, pharmacological characteristics of plant sterols/stanols have been summarized and discussed. In particular, experimental data that demonstrate the effects of dietary phytosterols on lipid metabolism and development of atherosclerotic lesions have been critically reviewed. Despite their similar chemical structures, phytosterols and cholesterol differ markedly from each other in regard to their pharmacological characteristics including intestinal absorption and metabolic fate. Compared to cholesterol, plant sterols have poor intestinal absorption. The most and best studied effects of plant sterols are their inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. Other biological activities of phytosterols such as effects on lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, bile acid synthesis, oxidation and uptake of lipoproteins, hepatic and lipoprotein lipase activities and coagulation system have been linked to their anti-atherogenic properties. Moreover, evidence for beneficial effects of plant sterols on disorders such as cutaneous xanthomatosis, colon cancer and prostate hyperplasia has been discussed. Finally, the potential adverse effects of plant sterols as well as pathophysiology of hereditary sitosterolemia are also reviewed. In conclusion, more pharmacokinetic data are needed to better understand metabolic fate of plant sterols/stanols and their fatty acid esters as well as their interactions with other nutraceutical/pharmaceutical agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Healthy Heart Program and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, St. Paul's Hospital and the University of British Columbia, 180-1081 Burrard St., Vancouver, British Columbia V6Z 1Y6 Canada. mhmoghad@unixg.ubc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moghadasian", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytosterols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolism, Inborn Errors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytosterols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "92"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12659166", "10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00665-2", "S0024-3205(00)00665-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
