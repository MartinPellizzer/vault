Childbearing women are among those who are asking nurses about herbal use, and therefore nurses need to learn more about this topic. One of the most important points to understand is that in the United States herbs are classified as dietary supplements (not drugs), and manufacturers are therefore not required to provide proof of efficacy or safety before selling these substances. Few studies about effects of herbs have been conducted in the general population, and fewer still have been published about pregnancy use. Because the perinatal nurse has two patients to consider when caring for a pregnant woman, he or she has two equally important mandates: to help the mother without harming the fetus. This article provides an overview of key concepts underlying herbal use in general and also safety in pregnancy. Common herbs that can be safely be used in pregnancy are presented in detail to enable the nurse to better care for the pregnant woman who is considering herbal use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Adjunct Clinical Faculty, University of Missouri, St. Louis, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Born", "ForeName": "Diane", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barron", "ForeName": "Mary Lee", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs", "NlmUniqueID": "7605941", "ISSNLinking": "0361-929X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["education", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Neonatal Nursing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nurse's Role"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "nursing", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["nursing", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Medication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}], "NumberOfReferences": "29"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15867682", "10.1097/00005721-200505000-00009", "00005721-200505000-00009"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
