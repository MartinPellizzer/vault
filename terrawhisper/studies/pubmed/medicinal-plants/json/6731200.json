The sperm density was improved by administration to 10 X 10(6)/ml or more in 22 patients (41.5%) and lowered to 10 X 10(6)/ml or more in only 2 patients (3.8%). The sperm motility was improved by 10% or over in 29 patients (54.7%) as compared with 5 patients (9.4%) in whom it was lowered by 10% or more. The sperm motile efficiency index ( SMEI ) was improved in 40 (75.5%) of the 53 patients. Statistically significant differences were noted in the improvement in sperm density, sperm motility and SMEI . By contrast, there was no difference in semen volume, sperm morphology or sperm agglutination between the pre- and post- treatment periods. During the period of treatment, the wives of 4 patients (7.5%) conceived children. These results suggest that TSUMURA - Hachimijiogan is effective for male infertility to a certain extent and that clinical trials on its use for male infertility may be meaningful."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuhashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maki", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takanami", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujio", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakayama", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shirai", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ando", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Hinyokika Kiyo", "NlmUniqueID": "0421145", "ISSNLinking": "0018-1994"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6731200"]}}]}
