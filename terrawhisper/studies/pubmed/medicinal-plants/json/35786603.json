However, the roots exhibit different medicinal effects depending on the processing conditions. Since the catalpol content differs greatly during the process, the catalpol content is an essential index for quality evaluation. R. glutinosa roots have various weights, diameters, and lengths, and there are differences between individuals and within an individual immediately after harvest. We found that, catalpol content in the roots tended to increase as root diameter increased. Furthermore, it has been reported that catalpol content decreased with drying, and our results also supported this phenomenon. To clarify the reason for the decrease in catalpol content, we investigated the effect of \u03b2-glucosidase in R. glutinosa cells. An in situ assay for \u03b2-glucosidase activity revealed that the activity in the tissue inside the cambium disappeared one month after drying under natural conditions, and the activity in the tissue outside the cambium completely disappeared after two months. Because catalpol content remained almost unchanged even after drying for two months, it was clarified that \u03b2-glucosidase activity had minimal involvement in the decrease in catalpol content in R. glutinosa roots. Based on the above results, we proposed that slicing the roots and rapidly removing water by natural drying is best to obtain dry root with little loss of catalpol content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yuting", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Ando", "ForeName": "Hirokazu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Tsujino", "ForeName": "Mai", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Yoshihara", "ForeName": "Kazuki", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "Yohei", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Vehicles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2415-24-9", "NameOfSubstance": "catalpol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cellulases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35786603", "10.1248/bpb.b21-01095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
