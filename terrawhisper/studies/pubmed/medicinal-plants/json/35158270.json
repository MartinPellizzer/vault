For evaluation of bioaccessibility, rosmarinic acid content, phenolic content, and antioxidant potential of samples before and after gastric and intestinal steps of digestion were determined. Results showed that the content, activity and bioaccessibility of basil phytochemicals varied depending on the cultivar as well as the applied postharvest preservation. It was found that the frozen and freeze-dried plant materials were characterized by a higher phenolic level and antioxidant activity compared to the convection dried. However, in general, convection drying allows obtaining samples with higher bioaccessibility of phytochemicals compared to the low-temperature processed samples. These findings highlight the need for evaluation of basil cultivars and postharvest preservation methods regarding phytochemicals bioaccessibility, which might help in the classification in terms of pro-health quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
