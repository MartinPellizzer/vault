However, there is a lack of modern analytical methods to evaluate the constituents of <i>P. macrophyllus</i> until the moment. This paper reports an analytical method based on UHPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS MRM methods to evaluate the ethanolic extracts of <i>P. macrophyllus</i> leaves and twigs. 15 main constituents were identified using a UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS profiling. Subsequently, a reliable analytical method was established and successfully used to quantitate the constituent's content using four marker compounds in leaf and twig extracts of this plant. The result obtained from the current study demonstrated the secondary metabolites and the variety of their derivatives in this plant. The analytical method can help evaluate the quality of <i>P.\u00a0macrophyllus</i> and develop high-value functional materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "Duc Dat", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "JeongJun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Sanghee", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korean Medicine Clinical Trial Center (K-CTC), Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seok-Geun", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Mina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korean Medicine Clinical Trial Center (K-CTC), Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "In Jin", "Initials": "IJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36800928", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2169863"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
