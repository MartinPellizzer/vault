Some plants were then grown in an agricultural experimental field station of the National Institute of Agricultural Research, where all the variables were known, allowing for a valid comparison between species and plants. In vitro uterotonic potency was assayed and the results expressed as equivalents of oxytocin. The wild plants were found to vary greatly in uterotonic potency, perhaps reflecting differences in ecological conditions. The most active uterotonic zoapatle aqueous crude extract was the Montanoa frutescens, and the least active was M. mollissima, the former having approximately 4 times the uterotonic potency of the latter. The plants grown in the agricultural field station showed a considerable decrease in uterotonic potency, but valid comparisons must await assay in winter to match the stage in the plant life when the wild samples were assayed. Plant age, the part of the plant from which the uterotonic principle is extracted, climate, altitude, and soil constituents are other possible influences on uterotonic potency. A sample of the zoapatle aqueous crude extract with the highest uterotonic potency will be assayed for its luteolytic activity in an animal model."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["014426", "00118709"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Health", "Health Services", "Latin America", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Mexico", "North America", "Plants, Medicinal"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6851557", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "07", "Day": "08"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "25"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0010-7824", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "27", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contraception"}, "ArticleTitle": "The zoapatle II--botanical and ecological determinants.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "227", "EndPage": "237", "MedlinePgn": "227-37"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["A collection of Montanoa (Cerv) specimens was conducted throughout Mexico.
