Feng Dan for its extracted various active components. However, the genetic basis for their activity is virtually unknown. The transcriptome of the root bark from \"Fengdan\" was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform. The clean reads were then de novo assembled into 72 997 unigenes. Among them, the number of unigenes which could been annotated by dataset Nr and GO was 41 139 and 34 592. The 20 016 unigenes could been annotated by KEGG dataset, which were involved in 5 major categories, 34 middle categories, and 352 metabolism pathways. The number of unigenes which were mapped to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway, terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was 214, 104, 152, 55 and 36 respectively, suggesting that they are involves in these pathways of pharmaceutically important. Furthermore, there also showed remarkable differences in groups which enrichment ratio of the different expressed gene compared. In addition, a total of 9 939 SSRs were identified from the sequence of 72 997 unigenes. This study not only provides many valuable basal data which was important gene in the synthesis pathway of secondary metabolites with gene searching, but also has important significance to find molecular marker in germplasm for breeding and improvement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Dong-Mei", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Nian-Jun", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Dai-Yin", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Cong-Bin", "Initials": "CB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Jiren Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Bozhou 236800, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yue-Jian", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Tongrentang Anhui Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials Co., Ltd., Tongling 244000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29139263", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170714.001"]}}]}
