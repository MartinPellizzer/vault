The aim of the present study is to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding the effect of apigenin on different dermatological complications. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to retrieve all papers assessing the dermatological effects of apigenin. Preclinical studies support beneficial effects of apigenin on UV-induced skin damage, vitiligo, dermatitis, wounds, skin aging, and some types of skin cancer. The compound mostly acts via inhibition of inflammation through suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and intracellular inflammatory mediators, as well as antioxidant properties such as improvement of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms. There are also some studies for the design and development of novel drug delivery systems for apigenin to improve its oral and topical bioavailability. Nevertheless, no clinical study has evaluated apigenin as a natural supplement for skin conditions. Considering the benefits of apigenin in preclinical models of dermatological disorders, as well as the acceptable safety of this compound, apigenin may be a future candidate to be used in dermatological disorders. Future clinical studies are needed to further confirm the safety and efficacy of apigenin in skin care products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
