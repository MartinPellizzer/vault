This study aimed to evaluate the bacterial killing efficiency of aPDT mediated by methylene blue (MB) loaded thermosensitive hydrogels against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Box-Behnken Design method was employed to investigate the impacts of the polymer compositions, Poloxamer 407, Poloxamer 188 and Carbopol 934P, on the gelation temperature (T<sub>sol-gel</sub>) and release rate of MB. The viscosity and in vitro bacterial killing efficiency of three selected formulations with T<sub>sol-gel</sub> ranged 25-34\u00a0\u00b0C and MB release in 2\u00a0h (the incubation time used for aPDT experiment)\u00a0\u2265\u00a070%, were assessed. The viscosity was found to increase with increasing P407 content and increasing total gel concentration. In the in vitro aPDT experiment, all tested MB-hydrogels demonstrated >2.5 log<sub>10</sub> colony forming unit (CFU) reduction against three clinical relevant MRSA strains. Interestingly, the bacterial reduction increased with decreasing amount of gel added (reduced MB concentration). This was possibly attributed to the increased viscosity at higher gel concentration reducing the diffusion rate of released MB towards bacterial cells leading to reduced aPDT efficiency. In summary, aPDT with the thermosensitive MB hydrogel formulations is a promising treatment strategy for wound infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
