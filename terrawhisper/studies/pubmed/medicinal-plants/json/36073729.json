Among them, oxidative stress and inflammation are the most fundamental co-morbid features. Therefore, multi-targets and multi-pathways therapies with significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are potential effective measures for preventing and treating NCDs. The flavonol glycoside compound hyperoside (Hyp) is widely found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, beverages, and medicinal plants and has various health benefits, especially excellent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties targeting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in NCDs and the biological activity and therapeutic potential of Hyp. Our findings reveal that the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities regulated by Hyp are associated with numerous biological mechanisms, including positive regulation of mitochondrial function, apoptosis, autophagy, and higher-level biological damage activities. Hyp is thought to be beneficial against organ injuries, cancer, depression, diabetes, and osteoporosis, and is a potent anti-NCDs agent. Additionally, the sources, bioavailability, pharmacy, and safety of Hyp have been established, highlighting the potential to develop Hyp into dietary supplements and nutraceuticals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiao-Jiao", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jin-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5763-6147"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Innovative Institute of Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Ao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8O1CR18L82", "NameOfSubstance": "hyperoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Noncommunicable Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36073729", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2115457"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
