The very high-conductance calcium-activated potassium ion channel, which is responsible for the maintenance of tone in smooth muscles, was activated by the saponins. The cytochrome P450 NADPH-dependent monooxygenase reaction, which produces epoxy- and hydroxylated eicosanoids from arachidonic acid metabolism, was inhibited by an analogue of the tetrahydroisoquinoline present in the plant. This analogue also acted as a reductant in the prostaglandin synthesizing system using microsomes from ram seminal vesicles. The same system was activated by the beta-phenylethylamines found in the plant material, with the formation of more prostaglandins, the type being dependent on the amount of cyclooxygenase enzyme used and the presence or absence of coenzyme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Ghana, Legon."}], "LastName": "Addy", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "8802730", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3278"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenethylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YG812J1I", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenethylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1438471", "10.1016/0952-3278(92)90191-k", "0952-3278(92)90191-K"]}}]}
