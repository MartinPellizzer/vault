The MeOH extract of plant was dissolved in dist. water and partitioned with n-hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and n-BuOH sequentially. Enzyme inhibition studies were done against four enzymes i.e. \u03b1-glucosidase, butyrylcholinesterase, acetyl cholinesterase and lipoxygenase. Ethyl acetate fraction possessed very good activity against \u03b1-glucosidase (IC<sub>50</sub> 57.38\u00b11.23\u00b5g/mL). CHCl3 fraction displayed good activity against \u03b1-glucosidase and lipoxygenase while moderate activity against butyryl cholinesterase. EtOAc fraction displayed good activity against lipoxygenase. Antifungal activity was studied against four fungi i.e. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Ganoderma lucidum and Alternaria alternata by the disc diffusion method using fluconazole, a standard antifungal drug, as positive control. Aqueous fraction displayed good activity against G. lucidum and A. flavus. Antibacterial activity was checked against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pasturella multocida and Escherichia coli by the disc diffusion method using streptomycin sulphate, a standard antibiotic, as positive control. Chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fraction showed good activity against E. coli. Chloroform fraction showed good activity against B. subtilis. Ethyl acetate fraction showed good activity against the P. multocida. All the studied fractions showed very less toxicity i.e. < 7%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government College
