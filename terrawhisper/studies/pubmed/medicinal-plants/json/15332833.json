Six herbal formulations that contain 39 different species from 21 plant families with their vernacular names, English names, amounts used, and their methods of preparation are reported. Our initial objective of this ethnobotanical analysis was to evaluate the validity and the efficacy of the plants used by (1) comparing other reported uses of these plants in traditional medicine, (2) investigating the medical and pharmacological literature on the medicinal properties of the plant species used, and (3) investigating the reported cytotoxic effects of compounds prevalent in these plants. Previous phytochemical analyses have shown that a number of plant species are rich in coumarin compounds that have potential antineoplastic or cytotoxic activities. Our results indicate a correlation between the reported use of these plants as abortifacients and their cytotoxic (antineoplastic) effects. In addition, we discuss the process in which this ethnobotanical investigation led to the discovery of dicoumarol (a coumarin anticoagulant) as a potential chemotherapeutic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madari", "ForeName": "Hamta", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacobs", "ForeName": "Robert S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Persia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}], "NumberOfReferences": "161"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15332833", "10.1021/np049953r"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
