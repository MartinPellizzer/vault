A lot of these supplements can be bought through internet, where a lot of illegal trade is going on. Every year seized dietary supplements are send to laboratories in order to screen for the presence of chemical adulterants or illegally added active pharmaceutical ingredients, though also herbal adulteration occurs and is given less attention. In this paper a two-step approach is presented based on fingerprints recorded by both infrared spectroscopy as liquid chromatography with UV-detection for the screening of five regulated plants used in respectively dietary supplements for slimming and potency enhancement. Both types of fingerprints are combined with chemometric techniques in order to obtain classification models. A first classification model is calculated based on the infrared data and gives a first idea about the plant suspected to be present. This suspicion is then confirmed based on binary classification models calculated with the chromatographic data obtained for the suspected plant. In general, good classification models were obtained for each of the targeted plants. The approach was applied in a small market study comprising 35 dietary supplements for slimming and 34 for male potency enhancement. In total 21 samples were found to contain one of the five targeted plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
