Of these isolates 778 sporulated and were identified into 21 taxa by morphological characteristics. Among the taxa 11 belonged to Coelomycetes, 6 to Ascomycetes, and 4 to Hyphomycetes. Various numbers of endophytic fungi (5-8 taxa) were obtained from each plant. Alternaria alternata was the dominant species in the 6 plants, and Microsphaeropsis conielloides was also dominant in Eucommia ulmoides. There were high colonization rates (47.9%-63.1%) and isolation rates (0.7-0.93) of endophytic fungi, and they were conspicuously higher in twigs than those in leaves in the 6 plants examined. The colonization and isolation rates of endophytic fungi increased with the twig age. The results based on the analyses of cluster and Sorenson's similarity coefficients indicated that some endophytic fungi showed a certain degree of host and tissue preference."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Systematic Mycology and Lichenology Laboratory, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jianqiu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Liangdong", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ping", "ForeName": "Wenxiang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Defu", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sci China C Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9611809", "ISSNLinking": "1006-9305"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18677603", "10.1007/s11427-008-0091-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
