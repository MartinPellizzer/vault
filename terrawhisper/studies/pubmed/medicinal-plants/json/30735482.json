Methods The silver nanoparticles were synthesized using Elaeodendron croceum stem bark and characterized. The oral acute toxicity studies were carried out by administration of 500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg body weight to Wister rats in respective groups. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using the WST-1 Cell Proliferation assay. The percentage of cell viability after treatment with aqueous extracts of Elaeodendron croceum (ECE) and Elaeodendron croceum silver nanoparticles (ECAgNPs) was compared with that of paclitaxel. Results The in vivo studies revealed that the LD50 was higher than 2000 mg/kg and there was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the treatment groups compared with the control group for mean organ-to-body weight ratio except in the liver and in all hematological parameters except WBC and hematocrit. Similarly, there was no significant difference (p>0.05) for serum electrolytes (Na+, Mg2+ K+, Cl-, and Ca2+), total protein, urea, \u0263-glutamyl transferase (GGT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, total and conjugated bilirubin between the treatment and the control group. However, there were changes in creatinine, urea, and cholesterol. In the in vitro assays, ECE and ECAgNPs showed IC50 values of 70.87\u00b12.99 and 138.8\u00b13.98 \u00b5g/mL respectively against MDA-MB-231 cells compared to paclitaxel, which showed an IC50 value of 80 ng/mL. Conclusion The results showed that the LD50 of the ECE and ECAgNPs in Wister rats was determined to be greater than 2000 mg/kg body weight. The aqueous extract also showed more cytotoxic than the ECAgNPs suggesting that the toxic compounds in aqueous extract were involved in the capping of the AgNPs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7580-6709"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MPED Research Niche Area, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Odeyemi", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Biomedical Biotechnology Research Unit (BioBRU), Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Biotechnology, Rhodes University, P.
