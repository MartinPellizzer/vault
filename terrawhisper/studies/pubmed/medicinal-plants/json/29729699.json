Fatty acids were measured with MG-Mass. Results showed that morphological traits were not very dependent on the climate, but the profile of the fatty acids was dependent. ANOVA of the effects of climate on the saturated fatty acid showed that there were significant differences between climates for all studied SFAs (P&lt;0.01) with the exception of Lauric acid. Mean squares of the effects of climate on the Unsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA) in showing that there were significant differences between climates for all studied MUFAs (P&lt;0.01). Mean squares of the effects of climate on the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), oil percentage and protein content of seeds indicated that there were significant differences between climates for all these studied traits. Mean squares of the effects of climate on the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), oil percentage and protein content of seeds indicated that there were significant differences between climates for all these studied traits. The statistical analysis for the effects of Climate on the ratio of the Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA) in Camelina sativa showed that there were significant differences (P&lt;0.01) for SFA, MUSFA, PUFA, MP, P:S and MP:S. Briefly, in the cold climates, the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids was higher. So it is possible to the cultivation of this plant in cold provinces for nutritional purposes and in tropical provinces for industrial and sanitary purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi, Kermanshah Unit, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Raziei", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development of Biseton Shafa Co., Kermanshah Science and Technology Park, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rostami-Ahmadvandi", "ForeName": "Hosein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29729699"]}}]}
