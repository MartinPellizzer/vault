This is reflected in the large number of herbal preparations for which psychotherapeutic potential has been evaluated in a variety of animal models. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of herbal extracts and constituents that have significant therapeutic effects in animal models of psychiatric illnesses. Eighty five individual herbs reviewed were classified as anxiolytic, antidepressant, neuroleptic, antidementia, or anti-substance abuse herbs. The full scientific name of each herb, herbal part used, active constituent, extract, dose range and route, animal model, possible mechanisms of action, and pertinent references are presented via synoptic tables. The herbal mixtures were also mentioned. A considerable number of herbal constituents whose behavioral effects and pharmacological actions have been well characterized may be good candidates for further investigations that may ultimately result in clinical use. The investigation of a large portion of the herbal extracts and herbal mixtures is in its infancy. Herbal remedies that have demonstrable psychotherapeutic activities have provided a potential to psychiatric pharmaceuticals and deserve increased attention in future studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA. zzhang1@usuhs.mil"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhang-Jin", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dementia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PubMed"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}], "NumberOfReferences": "367"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15268969", "10.1016/j.lfs.2004.04.014", "S0024320504004849"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
