The 8540-fold-purified OCT exhibited a specific activity of 526 micromoles citrulline per minute per milligram of protein at 35 degrees C and pH 8.0. The enzyme represents approximately 0.01% of the total soluble protein in the leaf. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 109 kDa as estimated by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein ran as a single band of molecular mass 36 kDa when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and at a single isoelectric point of 6.6 when subjected to denaturing isoelectric focusing. These results suggest that the enzyme is a trimer of identical subunits. Among the tested amino acids, L-cysteine and S-carbamoyl-L-cysteine were the most effective inhibitors of the enzyme. The OCT of kidney bean showed a very low activity towards canaline. The OCTs of canavanine-deficient plants have very low canaline-dependent activities, but the OCTs of canavanine-containing plants showed high canaline-dependent activities. It was assumed that the substrate specificity of this enzyme determines the canavanine synthetic activity of the urea cycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Seoul National University, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jun", "ForeName": "B O", "Initials": "BO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3HZV514J4B", "NameOfSubstance": "Canavanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "590-55-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbamyl Phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E524N2IXA3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ornithine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.3.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Canavanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbamyl Phosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ornithine"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9640663", "10.1007/s004250050333", "10.1007/s004250050333"]}}]}
