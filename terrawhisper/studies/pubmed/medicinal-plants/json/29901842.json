In Experiment 1, 24 male lambs were randomly divided into four groups: One group was fed an unsupplemented basal diet (control), and three groups were fed a diet supplemented with 70\u00a0mg Zn/kg diet in the form of Zn sulphate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub> ), a Zn-chelate of glycine hydrate (Zn-Gly) or a Zn-proteinate (Zn-Pro), for five months. The ruminal content was collected separately from each lamb, and batch cultures of ruminal fluid were incubated in vitro with mixture of medicinal plants (Mix) with different roughage:concentrate ratios (800:200 and 400:600, w/w). Bioactive compounds in Mix were quantified by UPLC/MS/MS. In Experiment 2, four sheep were fed a diet consisting of meadow hay and barley grain (400:600, w/w), with Zn-Gly (70\u00a0mg Zn/kg diet), Mix (10% replacement of meadow hay) or Zn-Gly and Mix (Zn-Gly-Mix) as supplements in a Latin square design. Mix decreased total gas (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and methane (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) production in vitro. In Experiment 1, caecal isobutyrate and isovalerate concentrations varied among the dietary treatments (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The isovalerate concentration of the zinc-supplemented groups in the distal colon was higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with the control. In Experiment 2, the molar proportion of isobutyrate was the highest in the faeces of the sheep fed the diet with Zn-Gly-Mix (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The plasma zinc concentration was higher in the groups fed a diet supplemented with zinc (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The haematological profile and antioxidant status did not differ between the dietary groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The diets containing medicinal plants and organic zinc thus helped to modulate the characteristics of fermentation in ruminants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3675-8641"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "V\u00e1radyov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Zora", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Mrav\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Dominika", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Holodov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Gre\u0161\u00e1kov\u00e1", "ForeName": "\u013dubomira", "Initials": "\u013d"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Pisar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Jana", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jab\u0142onna, Poland."}], "LastName": "Barszcz", "ForeName": "Marcin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jab\u0142onna, Poland."}], "LastName": "Taciak", "ForeName": "Marcin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences, Jab\u0142onna, Poland."}], "LastName": "Tu\u015bnio", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6608-4903"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "Ki\u0161idayov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Svetlana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Physiology, Centre of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Ko\u0161ice, Slovak Republic."}], "LastName": "\u010cobanov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Klaudia", "Initials": "K"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "APVV-0667-12", "Agency": "Slovak Research and Development Agency", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "APVV-14-0169", "Agency": "Slovak Research and Development Agency", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "VEGA 2/0069/17", "Agency": "Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Physiol Anim Nutr (Berl)", "NlmUniqueID": "101126979", "ISSNLinking": "0931-2439"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29901842", "10.1111/jpn.12940"]}}]}
