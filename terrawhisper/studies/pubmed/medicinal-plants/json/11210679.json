(Polygonaceae) (D-1) on capillary permeability which was induced by xylol and hyaluronidase was investigated. Experiments were conducted on rabbits according to Monakova and Matusis methods. The effects of D-1 were compared to those of indomethacin, which was used as a control throughout the experiment. Both D-1 (100 mg/kg) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) were administered orally. As a result, D-1 inhibited capillary permeability, which was induced by xylol and hyaluronidase, and it was found that it was as effective as indomethacin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Atat\u00fcrk University, Erzurum, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00fcleyman", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demirezer", "ForeName": "L O", "Initials": "LO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuru\u00fcz\u00fcm", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "B\u00fcy\u00fckokuro\u011flu", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u014f\u00e7er", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bano\u011flu", "ForeName": "Z N", "Initials": "ZN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gepdiremen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z2474E14QP", "NameOfSubstance": "2-xylene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyaluronoglucosaminidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11210679"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
