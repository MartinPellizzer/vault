If it is the intention of the World Health Organization to provide health care for all by the year 2000, some positive steps need to be taken to develop and foster traditional medicine. There is a threat of extinction to certain species of plants, and it is necessary to have national herbaria established. Systematic cultivation, extraction and storage should continue on a scientific basis. The traditional system of medicine needs to be developed on the principles of that system. In order to avoid losing available literature in this area for ever, it is important that an encyclopedia of medicinal plants used in traditional medicine be compiled in each country."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["801903", "00080468"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7453207", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "03", "Day": "24"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "30"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0378-8741", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "2", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "Jun"}}, "Title": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Ethnopharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Some questions about the future of traditional medicine in developing countries.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "193", "EndPage": "194", "MedlinePgn": "193-4"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weragoda", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7453207", "10.1016/0378-8741(80)90015-x", "0378-8741(80)90015-X"]}}]}
