In order to solve the resource shortage, a lot of work has been done to develop the alternative method. Recently, using synthetic biology to realize heterologous biosynthesis of the precursors of taxol has become a hotspot. Now, the basic framework of taxol biosynthetic pathways has been confirmed, and most enzyme genes involved in taxol biosynthesis have been cloned and identified. The two taxol precursors, taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene and taxa-4(20),11(12)-dien-5\u03b1-ol, have been synthesized in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here this paper reviewed the recent advances in the biosynthetic pathway of taxol and the latest developments of synthetic biology, which aims to provide a guidance for the heterologous biosynthesis of taxol."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Xue-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cai-Xia", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Li-Qiu", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synthetic Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933080", "10.4268/cjcmm20162210"]}}]}
