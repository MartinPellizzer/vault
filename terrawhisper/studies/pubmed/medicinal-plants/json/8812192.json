Natural vegetations in a 2-acre plot adjacent to the forage plots were also studied for Se accumulation comparisons. During the dry season, in the fall of 1994, the field plots were either irrigated weekly or without irrigation. No fertilization and weed control were applied. The plants were harvested in May 1995. There were considerable differences in the ability of Se uptake between the forage and the legume species and among the naturally established plant species; the amount of Se accumulated per land area was largely dependent on their respective biomass production. Comparing Se concentration between preplant and postharvest, there was a detectable reduction in the soil selenate, selenite, and water-extractable organic Se in the tall fescue and melilotus plots. The field irrigation provided more favorable conditions for bioextractions and dissipation of Se by the plants. However, the available soil Se only accounts for less than 10% of the total soil Se and no detectable reduction of total soil Se was found. This may be due to the large inventory and variation of Se concentrations in the field soils and therefore obscured the detectable differences. For practical considerations, the forage plants can be repeatedly harvested and used for rangelands of Se deficiency currently seen in some northern California counties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of California, Davis, California, 95616, USA."}], "LastName": "Van Mantgem", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Banuelos", "ForeName": "G S", "Initials": "GS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "California"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8812192", "10.1006/eesa.1996.0068", "S0147-6513(96)90068-8"]}}]}
