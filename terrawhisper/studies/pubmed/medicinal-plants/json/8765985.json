Volatile compounds were analysed by gas chromatography, using flame ionization detection (FID), mass spectrometry and sniffing port detection. Areas of FID peaks were largest in the PT system, followed by those of the DHM and DH systems, respectively. Saliva composition as well as volume influenced the release of volatile compounds from rehydrated French beans. Generally, FID data showed a decrease in release by the saliva component mucin, because of interactions between volatile compounds and protein, and in increase in release by its alpha-amylase, probably due to degradation of inclusion complexes of starch. The decrease in flavour release by the enlarged saliva volume was evaluated by a model study. Sniffing patterns of odour active compounds were barely influenced by either saliva composition or volume."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "van Ruth", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roozen", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nahon", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cozijnsen", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Posthumus", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Lebensm Unters Forsch", "NlmUniqueID": "7509812", "ISSNLinking": "0044-3026"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Drying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saliva, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8765985", "10.1007/BF01267761"]}}]}
