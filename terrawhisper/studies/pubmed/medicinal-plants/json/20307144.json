Currently, a large body of evidence supports the key role of free radicals in diverse pathological conditions such as aging and atherosclerosis. The present investigation essentially focuses on the comprehensive account of in vitro antioxidant activity exerted by C.borivilianum root extracts (i.e., aqueous and ethanolic), to clarify the pharmacological antagonism of chemicals/metals-mediated oxidation. Graded-dose (25 to 1000 microg/ml) of aqueous extract exhibited higher antioxidant potency as evidenced by powerful nitric oxide, superoxide, hydroxyl, DPPH and ABTS(*+) radicals scavenging activity along with reducing capacity (Fe(3+)/ferricyanide complex and FRAP assays), metal chelating ability, as well as markedly suppressed the lipid peroxidation in mitochondrial fractions as compared to ethanolic extract. Further, aqueous extract significantly decreased (P < 0.05) copper-mediated human serum and kinetics of LDL oxidation, as demonstrated by prolongation of lag phase time with decline of oxidation rate, conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In addition, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of aqueous extract were higher than that of ethanolic extract, which indicated a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and contents of total phenols. The IC(50) values of both extracts were also compared with appropriate antioxidant standards. Overall, aqueous extract of C.borivilianum root has significant powerful antioxidant activity and may favorably affect atherosclerosis risk status by reducing LDL oxidation susceptibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BRD School of Biosciences, Sardar Patel Maidan, Vadtal Road, Satellite Campus, Postbox 39, Sardar Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar 388 120, Gujarat, India. nishant.visavadiya@uky.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Visavadiya", "ForeName": "Nishant P", "Initials": "NP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soni", "ForeName": "Badrish", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalwadi", "ForeName": "Nirav", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madamwar", "ForeName": "Datta", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LRX7AJ16DT", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper Sulfate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Copper Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20307144", "10.3109/01480540903311068"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
