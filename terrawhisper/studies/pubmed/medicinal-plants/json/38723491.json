Extensive efforts have been made to achieve this goal. In this work, metal-organic framework Ni-MOF precursors were first synthesized by solvothermal method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as an ideal templating agent, stabiliser and nanoparticle dispersant. After carbonization and acid washing, the nanoporous carbon microspheres material (Ni@C-acid) was obtained. Compared with the material without acid treatment (Ni@C), the specific surface area, pore volume, adsorption performance of Ni@C-acid were increased. Thanks to its excellent characteristics (high stability, abundant benzene rings), Ni@C-acid was used as fiber coatings in headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technology for extraction and preconcentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) prior to gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analysis. The experimental parameters of extraction temperature, extraction time, agitation speed, desorption temperature, desorption time and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration were studied. Under optimal experimental conditions, the wide linear range (0.01-30 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>), the good correlation coefficient (0.9916-0.9984), the low detection limit (0.003-0.011 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>), and the high enrichment factor (5273-13793) were obtained. The established method was successfully used for the detection of trace PAHs in actual tea infusions samples and satisfied recoveries ranging from 80.94-118.62 % were achieved. The present work provides a simple method for the preparation of highly stable and adsorbable porous carbon microsphere materials with potential applications in the extraction of environmental pollutants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
