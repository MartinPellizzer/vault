The scanning electron micrographs indicated the protective function of the association of Shiquandabutang with Hetaokun for liver.", "12.5 mg x kg(-1) Hetaokun could obviously restrain the tumor when it was singly used at 73.1%, but it increased SGPT at the same time. The association of Shiquandabutang with Hetaokun could protect liver of the mouse S180. SGPT (P > 0.05) was compared with the common ones and the result showed that the association of shiquandabutang with Hetaokun could make K value increase (P > 0.01).
