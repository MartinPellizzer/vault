Cancer is categorized into several types on the basis of affected organs and breast cancer (BC) is the most predominant cause of mortality among women. Although, several synthetic and semi-synthetic therapies have been developed for the treatment of BC but they exhibit numerous serious adverse effects therefore; pharmacological agents with fewer/no side effects need to be explored. Plants and phytoconstituents perhaps fulfill the aforementioned requirement and could serve as a potential and alternative therapy for BC treatment. The ongoing biomedical research, clinical trials and number of patents granted have further boosted the acceptance of the plants and plant-derived constituents in the effective treatment of BC.", "Various treatment strategies such as checkpoint inhibitors, targeting micro RNA, apoptotic pathway, BRCA-1 gene, P<sub>53</sub> protein, P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway, notch signaling pathway, hedgehog/gli-1 signaling pathway, poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors etc. are available for BC. In addition to these synthetic and semi-synthetic drug therapies, several natural constituents such as alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, polyphenols, flavonoids and diterpenoids from medicinal plants, vegetables and fruits are reported to possess promising anti-cancer activity. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the various signaling pathways through which plants/herbs show the anti-cancer potential especially against the BC.", "The literature for the present study was collected from various databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Chemical Abstracts, Medicinal and aromatic plant abstracts, Web of Science etc. The different patent databases were also reviewed for the anti-cancer (BC) potential of the particular herbs/plants and their formulations.", "In this review, we have discussed the number of plants along with their patents of different herbal formulations which are being used for the treatment of BC and other types of cancers. We have also delineated the different signaling mechanisms through which they inhibit the growth of BC cells. In nutshell, we can conclude that large numbers of herbs or their extracts are reported for the treatment of BC. But still, there is further need for research in-depth to translate the use of natural products clinically BC treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
