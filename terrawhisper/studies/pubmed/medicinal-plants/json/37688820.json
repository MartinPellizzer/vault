(Fabaceae) is a medicinal and ornamental plant, widely used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. There is no strong scientific evidence on the consumption of the tender fruits/seeds of blue- and white-flower plants as vegetables. Analysis of the nutrient composition revealed that the total carbohydrate, protein, and lipid were highest in the mature-stage seeds of both varieties. UHPLC analysis revealed the presence of rutin (1.66\u00a0mg%) as the major compound. LC-HRMS confirmed the presence of other bioactives, such as sinapic acid (m/z 223), catechin derivatives (m/z 305 and m/z 153), quercetin (m/z 463), etc., as well. The ascorbic acid content was found to be highest in blue-flowered plant seeds (18.10\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g). Analysis of antioxidant activity displayed the superiority of immature seeds over mature seeds. The research shows that these seeds are rich in nutrients and bioactives, which may have use in the food and pharmaceutical industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
