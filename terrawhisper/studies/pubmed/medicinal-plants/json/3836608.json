Samples were germinated for two and four days at room temperature (25 - 27 degrees C). One portion of each germinated chickpea sample was boiled for 40 min and the other portion was autoclaved at 15 psi for 15 min. These processed samples were then compared with the corresponding value of raw germinated and ungerminated samples as well as with the ungerminated processed ones for the following characteristics: chemical composition, contents of antiphysiological factors, solubility of proteins, lysine availability, net protein ratio (NPR), and digestibility of proteins. Germination caused an increase in the protein content of the seeds. No appreciable changes were observed in the trypsin inhibitor and tannin contents during germination. Availability of lysine was found slightly lower in the germinated seeds. The solubility of the nitrogenous constituents was markedly increased during germination. Along with processing, germination had no beneficial effect in improving protein quality, although digestibility of the proteins was increased. Boiling was more advantageous in the case of germinated seeds than autoclaving, whereas the reverse was true in the case of ungerminated seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khaleque", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El\u00edas", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Braham", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3836608"]}}]}
