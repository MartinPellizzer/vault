Due to the misuse or excessive use of antibiotics, the upsurge of multidrug-resistance cases in UTIs has now become a global threat to public health. Exploring a newer or safer treatment using green synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) is another substitute for eliminating multidrug-resistant pathogens.", "Leaf extract of <i>Syzygium cumini</i> was used for green synthesis of gold NPs. Synthesis of <i>Syzygium cumini\u00a0</i>gold nanoparticles (ScAu-NPs) was achieved by optimizing various reaction parameters. These ScAu-NPs were characterized through UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction. ScAu-NPs were then processed for antibacterial activity against clinically isolated multidrug-resistant pathogens like <i>Escherichia coli</i>,\u00a0<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>.", "Characterization of NPs revealed that biosynthesized NPs were spherical in shape. FTIR spectroscopy showed the presence of phenolics and aromatic compounds. Biosynthesized NPs exhibit good antibacterial activity with a significant bacterial reduction seen against all bacterial isolates compared to the controls.", "From the results of the present study, the formulation of biosynthesized ScAu-NPs can be utilized in drug development for eliminating infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, Diksha et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, IND."}], "LastName": "Diksha", "ForeName": "Diksha", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, IND."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Shailesh K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, IND."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Pratima", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology, Amity University, Mohali, IND."}], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "Uttam C", "Initials": "UC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, IND."}], "LastName": "Kalita", "ForeName": "Deepjyoti", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
