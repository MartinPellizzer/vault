One was in ITS1 region, and the other was in 5.8S region. It was proved that there was some relativity between the character of rDNA ITS region and the life type of the populations. The phenomenon of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) existed in 5.8S region of rDNA ITS region between F type and H type. The sequences of rDNA ITS region of D. officinale were reported for the first time, and the sequences of ITS region ranged 634 bp (ITS1 231 bp, ITS2 240 bp, 5.8S 163 bp).", "The analysis of rDNA ITS of D. officinale deeply reveal the population differences of D. officinale of F type and H type."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Chinese Pharmacy. dingxynj@263.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Xiao-yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zheng-tao", "Initials": "ZT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Luo-shan", "Initials": "LS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Kai-ya", "Initials": "KY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Guo-xin", "Initials": "GX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12774378"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
