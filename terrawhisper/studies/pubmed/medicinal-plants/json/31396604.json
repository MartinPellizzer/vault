In Plasmodium falciparum, type II nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (NDH-2) is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of two electrons from NADH to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which in turn transfers the electrons to coenzyme Q (CoQ). As an entry enzyme for oxidative phosphorylation, NDH-2 has become one of the popular targets for the development of new antimalarial drugs. In this study, reliable motion trajectories of the NDH-2 complex with its co-factors (NADH and FAD) and inhibitor, RYL-552, were obtained by comparative molecular dynamics simulations. The influence of cofactor binding on the global motion of NDH-2 was explored through conformational clustering, principal component analysis and free energy landscape. The molecular interactions of NDH-2 before and after its binding with the inhibitor RYL-552 were analyzed, and the key residues and important hydrogen bonds were also determined. The results show that the association of RYL-552 results in the weakening of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and large allosterism of NDH-2. There was a significant positive correlation between the angular change of the key pocket residues in the NADH-FAD-pockets that represents the global functional motion and the change in distance between NADH-C4 and FAD-N5 that represents the electron transfer efficiency. Finally, the possible non-competitive inhibitory mechanism of RYL-552 was proposed. Specifically, the association of inhibitors with NDH-2 significantly affects the global motion mode of NDH-2, leading to widening of the distance between NADH and FAD through cooperative motion induction; this reduces the electron transfer efficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The simulation results provide useful theoretical guidance for subsequent antimalarial drug design based on the NDH-2 structure and the respiratory chain electron transfer mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Biological Engineering, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610106, China. hjpcdu@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhixiang", "Initials": "Z", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Jinke", "Initials": "J", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Runyu", "Initials": "R", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Huaichuan", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xinyu", "Initials": "X", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yafei", "Initials": "Y", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Dianyong", "Initials": "D", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hubing", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protozoan Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0U46U6E8UK", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "146-14-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.99.3", "NameOfSubstance": "NADH Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "NAD"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "NADH Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Protozoan Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31396604", "10.1039/c9cp02645b"]}}]}
