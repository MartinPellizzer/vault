There is a growing interest in the use of medicinal plants or food-derived bioactive compounds for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties to improve metabolic function. For example, rutin, a flavonol derivative of quercetin that is found in several medicinal plants and food sources has displayed therapeutic benefits against diverse metabolic diseases. Here, we searched the major electronic databases and search engines such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar to systematically extract and critically discuss evidence reporting on the impact of rutin against metabolic diseases by affecting inflammation. In fact, available preclinical evidence suggests that rutin, through its strong antioxidant properties, can effectively ameliorate inflammation by reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, cyclooxygenase-2, IL-1\u03b2, as well as blocking nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation to improve metabolic function. Notably, although clinical data on the impact of rutin on inflammation is limited, food-derived sources rich in this flavonol such as Fagopyrum tataricum, Coffea arabica and Aspalathus linearis (rooibos) have shown promise in improving metabolic function, in part by reducing markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. However, additional studies are still required to confirm the therapeutic properties of rutin in a clinical setting, including the enhancement of it low bioavailability profile."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
