Components with a high binding ability to \u03b1-Man can be precisely oriented in a narrower fractions range and are easy to isolate. Three human cancer cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of component with the highest affinity to \u03b1-Man.", "Eight compounds were isolated and identificated from <i>A. inebrians</i> for the first time. Deoxyvasicinone possessed the highest affinity to \u03b1-Man among them. Moreover, deoxyvasicinone showed good effects on inhibited proliferation of human hepatoma cells HepG2 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a05.7\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), human breast cancer cells MCF7 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a07.21\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) and human lung cancer cells HCC827 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.75\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), respectively. In particular, its inhibitory effect on HCC827 was stronger than the positive drug gefitinib (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.65\u00a0\u03bcmol/L).", "A comprehensive strategy of directional screening potential cytotoxic components from herb based on biomolecular interaction and chromatography was established. Deoxyvasicinone as an effective anti-cancer component was initially isolated from <i>A. inebrians</i>. It is expected that this screening strategy could provide new perspectives for rapid screening and identification of active components from natural plants with the complex matrix."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Tianjin Press of Chinese Herbal Medicines.
