It has been used as a traditional medicine to treat common cold, flu, cough, hepatitis, hemorrhoids, etc. The purpose of the study is to explicate antiviral compounds responsible for its traditional use for the common cold or flu.", "The methanolic extract of the aerial parts of S. plebeia was extracted with CHCl<sub>3</sub>, EtOAc, and n-BuOH, successively. The EtOAc and CHCl<sub>3</sub> fractions were subjected to a successive of chromatographic method, which led to the isolation of fourteen compounds. Inhibition activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated against influenza A (H1N1) neuraminidase.", "Chemical investigation of the methanolic extracts of S. plebeia resulted in the isolation of two novel benzoylated monoterpene glycosides, named as plebeiosides A (1) and B (2), together with twelve known compounds including four flavonoids (4-5, 7, 10), two sesquiterpenoids (8, 12), four phenolics (9-10, 13-14), a steroid (6), and a triterpenoid (3). Their chemical structures were elucidated based on spectroscopic data and absolute stereochemistries of 1 and 2 were determined by comparison of optical rotations of their hydrolysates with literature values. Compounds 5, 7, 9, and 11 exhibited potent enzymatic inhibition against H1N1 neuraminidase (IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 11.18\u00b11.73 to 19.83\u00b12.28\u03bcM). Furthermore, two flavonoids (5 and 7) and one rosmarinic acid methyl ester (9) reduced cytopathic effects of the H1N1 virus during replication.", "The antiviral activities of the flavonoids and phenolics isolated from the extracts of S. plebeia supported the traditional application of this medicine on common cold or flu. In this study, benzoylated monoterpene glycosides were first found to exist in this species. Moreover, the present study suggested potential of three compounds (5, 7, and 9) to be new lead structures for the development of new neuraminidase inhibitors in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
