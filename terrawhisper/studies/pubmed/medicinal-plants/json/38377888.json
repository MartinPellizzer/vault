The withanolides are biosynthesized through triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway with the involvement of WsCAS leading to cyclization of 2, 3 oxidosqualene, which is a key metabolite to further diversify to a myriad of phytochemicals. In contrast to the available reports on the studies of WsCAS in withanolide biosynthesis, its involvement in phytosterol biosynthesis needs investigation. Present work deals with the understanding of role of WsCAS triterpenoid synthase gene in the regulation of biosynthesis of phytosterols & withanolides. Docking studies of WsCAS protein revealed Conserved amino acids, DCATE motif, and QW motif which are involved in efficient substrate binding, structure stabilization, and catalytic activity. Overexpression/silencing of WsCAS leading to increment/decline of phytosterols confers its stringent regulation in phytosterols biosynthesis. Differential regulation of WsCAS on the metabolic flux towards phytosterols and withanolide biosynthesis was observed under abiotic stress conditions. The preferential channelization of 2, 3 oxidosqualene towards withanolides and/or phytosterols occurred under heat/salt stress and cold/water stress, respectively. Stigmasterol and \u03b2-sitosterol showed major contribution in high/low temperature and salt stress, and campesterol in water stress management. Overexpression of WsCAS in Arabidopsis thaliana led to the increment in phytosterols in general. Thus, the WsCAS plays important regulatory role in the biosynthetic pathway of phytosterols and withanolides under abiotic stress conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
