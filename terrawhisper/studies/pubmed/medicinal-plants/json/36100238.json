These compounds were designed by introducing different substituents on the B ring. Among these synthesised compounds, it was proved that <b>4k</b> showed excellent activity against A549, HepG2, and HCT-15 cell lines, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 7.60\u2009\u03bcM, 20.53\u2009\u03bcM, and 4.59\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. The results of tubulin polymerisation inhibition and immunofluorescence staining experiments displayed that <b>4k</b> could act on tubulin and inhibit the polymerisation of tubulin. Moreover, the wound healing assay showed that <b>4k</b> could inhibit the migration of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the results of flow cytometry revealed that <b>4k</b> was capable of blocking the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, inducing a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and ultimately leading to apoptosis in A549 cells. Importantly, the possible binding model was also performed by molecular docking. <b>Subject classification codes:</b> short communication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Teaching and Research Section of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Teaching and Research Section of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Huining", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Trails Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Zhiyun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9104-337X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guangcheng", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101150203", "ISSNLinking": "1475-6366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tubulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tubulin Modulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "litseaone B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tubulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tubulin Modulators"}], "CoiStatement": "No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Jordan MA, Wilson L..
