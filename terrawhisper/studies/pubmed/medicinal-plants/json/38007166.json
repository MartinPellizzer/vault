It is mixed with butter and used for boosting energy and sexual health in the subcontinent.", "This study was designed to evaluate the chemical composition, aphrodisiac potential and effect of V. stocksii on the risk factors associated with ED.", "The hydroethanolic extract of V. stocksii (HEEVS) was prepared through the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) technique. The chemical composition was evaluated using preliminary phytochemical screening and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Metals and minerals analysis was performed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The aphrodisiac activity of HEEVS was evaluated using an in vivo aphrodisiac model established in male albino rats and the effect on various sexual parameters such as mount, intromission, ejaculation frequencies and mount, intromission, ejaculation latencies, postejaculatory interval, penile reflexes and serum hormone concentration were analyzed. The effect of HEEVS on various risk factors associated with ED, including prostate cancer (PC), bacterial infections, diabetes and obesity, was evaluated using various in vitro assays. Moreover, four compounds were selected from the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS profile and evaluated for in silico computational analysis against phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) for possible interaction.", "The phytochemical screening revealed the presence of various secondary metabolites in HEEVS, while 58 compounds were tentatively identified in the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Various important minerals and metals such as zinc, calcium, cadmium and magnesium were detected in the atomic absorption spectrometry analysis. The in vivo aphrodisiac evaluation showed a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase in the mount, intromission and ejaculation frequencies and a decrease in the mount, intromission latencies and post-ejaculatory intervals at a dose of 300\u00a0mg/kg. A marked (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase was observed in the concentration of serum testosterone and luteinizing hormones in HEEVS treated animals with a significant increase in total penile reflexes. The extract displayed significant anti-prostate cancer activity and a potential antibacterial spectrum against E. coli and S. aureus, with MIC<sub>50</sub> values of 215.72\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 139.05\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Similarly, HEEVS was found active towards pancreatic lipase (67.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.03%), \u03b1-glucosidase (3.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54\u00a0mmol ACAE/g d.w.) and \u03b1-amylase (6.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.63\u00a0mmol ACAE/g d.w.). The in silico docking study presented a potential interaction between the selected compounds and residues of the active site of PDE-5.", "This report highlights the aphrodisiac potential of V. stocksii and provides experimental support for its traditional use in ED with an attenuative effect on the risk factors associated with ED. Moreover, the chemical composition displayed the presence of functional phytoconstituents and minerals in HEEVS and paves the way for the isolation of compounds with potent aphrodisiac activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
