For Pickering emulsions, the aqueous phase was HPMC and the oil phase was Miglyol<sup>\u00ae</sup> 812; for Classical emulsions, water with Tween<sup>\u00ae</sup> 20 and Miglyol<sup>\u00ae</sup> 812 with Span<sup>\u00ae</sup> 80 were used for aqueous and oil phases, respectively. Crude or fractionated extracts were added to the aqueous phase (5% w/v). Both phases were heated (40\u2009\u00b0C); then, the oil phase was poured into the aqueous phase and homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax. Emulsions were characterized for 90\u00a0days by pH, polyphenol content, phytomarker content, macroscopic characteristics, droplet size, and zeta potential.<b>Results:</b> These formulations displayed satisfactory stability for 90\u00a0days when stored at 25\u2009\u00b0C. Regarding the investigation of rheological properties, Pickering emulsions displayed higher viscosity with lesser deformation than Classical emulsions. Moreover, the emulsions displayed similar <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> release behavior.<b>Conclusion:</b> Based on the results of present study, the Pickering emulsions were obtainable and displayed higher stability than Classical emulsions. Additionally, maintenance of system integrity points to promising systems for delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the internal phase, despite the complex chemical mixture added to the external phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8668-6223"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PPgCF), Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ferreira", "ForeName": "Magda Rhayanny Assun\u00e7\u00e3o", "Initials": "MRA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9553-0033"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Technology, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Daniels", "ForeName": "Rolf", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3142-6173"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PPgCF), Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Luiz Alberto Lira", "Initials": "LAL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7802620", "ISSNLinking": "0363-9045"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32536225", "10.1080/03639045.2020.1782422"]}}]}
