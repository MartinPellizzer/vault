Thus, in these patients, antibiotic therapy based on empirical evidence is necessary. Finding appropriate antimicrobial agents, especially with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, is a promising approach to target the virus and its complications, hyper-inflammation, and microorganisms resulting in co-infection. Moreover, indiscriminate use of antibiotics can be accompanied by Clostridioides difficile colitis, the emergence of resistant microorganisms, and adverse drug reactions, particularly kidney damage and QT prolongation. Therefore, rational administration of efficient antibiotics is an important issue. The main objective of the present review is to provide a summary of antibiotics with possible antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-immunomodulatory effects to guide scientists for further research. Besides, the findings can help health professionals in the rational prescription of antibiotics in Covid-19 patients with a high risk of co-infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brain Cancer Research Core (BCRC), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutics Research Center, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abadi", "ForeName": "Banafshe", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Afzalipour Hospital, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ilaghi", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahsavani", "ForeName": "Yasamin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brain Cancer Research Core (BCRC), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faramarzpour", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Oghazian", "ForeName": "Mohammad Bagher", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi", "ForeName": "Hamid-Reza", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Rev Clin Exp Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9918227368306676", "ISSNLinking": "2772-4328"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coinfection"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "45"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34994339", "10.2174/2772432817666220106162013", "CRCEP-EPUB-120032"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
