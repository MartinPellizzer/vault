There were marked potentiating effects on delayed hypersensitivity reaction induced by 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene in normal NIH mice treated with IIP as well as in immunodepressed mice induced by cyclophosphamide. By administration of IIP, the percentage of ANAE+ lymphocytes stained with acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase method were significantly increased in peripheral blood of normal ICR mice, and the decreases in number of ANAE+ lymphocytes in mice induced by hydrocortisone were prevented to a certain extent. But IIP could not enhance Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation of C57BL mouse spleen cells in vitro measured with MTT colorimetric assay. In addition, the plaque forming cells in 5 x 10(6) splenocytes of NIH mice treated with IIP were higher than that of the control group (P less than 0.01). IIP could also elevate the clearance rate of intra-venous charcoal particles in normal mice, i.e., stimulated the phagocytic activity of macrophages. The result indicates that IIP is capable of increasing humoral and cellular immune functions and enhancing the functions of reticuloendothelial system, and might be a good immunopotentiator."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing College of TCM."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8207427", "ISSNLinking": "0254-9034"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody-Producing Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1889106"]}}]}
