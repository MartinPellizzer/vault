Here we report further studies on sanguiin H-6, a dimeric ellagitannin isolated from Sanguisorba officinalis as an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerases. Catalytic strand-passing activities of topoisomerases I and II were inhibited in vitro with IC50 values of 1 microM and 0.01 microM, respectively. This inhibition was not associated with stabilization of covalent enzyme-DNA complexes but rather by a mechanism preventing formation of such covalent intermediates, as measured by interference with drug-induced cleavage in vitro. The IC50 values for topoisomerase I-DNA complexes induced by camptothecin and with topoisomerase II-DNA complexes induced by VP-16 were 0.02 microM and 0.16 microM, respectively. Pre-incubation studies followed by drug-dilution revealed that the in vitro inhibitory effects of sanguiin H-6 were irreversible, and for topoisomerase I, the test compound prevented enzyme-DNA interaction as seen by shifts in mobility on agarose gels. By measuring interference with drug-induced protein-linked DNA breaks in isolated HeLa nuclei, inhibition of topoisomerases I and II on a natural chromatin template was demonstrated with IC50 values of 5 microM and > 10 microM, respectively. Sanguiin H-6 inhibited HeLa cell growth with an ED50 of 12 microM and also interfered in a dose-dependent fashion with intracellular topoisomerase activities but with lower potencies than those observed using subcellular assay systems. Based on these studies, sanguiin H-6 could be broadly classified as a type of poison which does not stimulate the formation of cleavable-complexes, with intracellular activity but without any marked selectivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medicinal Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599."}], "LastName": "Bastow", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bori", "ForeName": "I D", "Initials": "ID"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fukushima", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kashiwada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nonaka", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishioka", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "BRSG 2 S07 RR07072", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA-54508", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Topoisomerase I Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ellagitannin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82978-00-5", "NameOfSubstance": "sanguiin H 6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.99.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Topoisomerases, Type I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Topoisomerases, Type I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Topoisomerase I Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8391144", "10.1055/s-2006-959659"]}}]}
