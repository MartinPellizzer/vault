However, its clinical use is limited by pain and fear of bee stings/injection. Nanoemulsions (NEs) are nanocarriers that are able to help their content(s) penetrate through the skin. They also act as drug reservoirs on the skin to provide an efficient, sustained-release vehicle.", "In this paper, we present the development of a stable water-in-oil NE to help passing BV through the animal skin when used topically.", "Particle size of NE was 12.7 to 29.8\u00a0nm for NEs containing 0 to 150\u00a0\u00b5g/ml BV. Also, its anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in rat models of type II collagen-induced arthritis. Topical administration of NEs containing 18.75 or 9.37\u00a0\u03bcg/ml BV were able to significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduce inflammation in the rat paws compared to the blank and control groups.", "Our findings demonstrated the efficacy of NEs containing BV to reduce inflammation caused by RA animal model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
