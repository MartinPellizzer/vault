Currently, there are limited effective treatments available for this disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (SARS-CoV-2 RdRp) has been identified as a potential target for drug development against COVID-19. Natural products have been shown to possess antiviral properties, making them a promising source for developing drugs against SARS-CoV-2.", "The objective of this study is to identify the most effective natural inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp among a set of 4924 African natural products using a multi-phase <i>in silico</i> approach.", "The study utilized remdesivir (RTP), the co-crystallized ligand of RdRp, as a starting point to select compounds that have the most similar chemical structures among the examined set of compounds. Molecular fingerprints and structure similarity studies were carried out in the first part of the study. The second part of the study included molecular docking against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 7BV2) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations including the calculation of RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, hydrogen bonding, and PLIP. Moreover, the calculations of Molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA) Lennard-Jones and Columbic electrostatic interaction energies have been conducted. Additionally, <i>in silico</i> ADMET and toxicity studies were performed to examine the drug likeness degrees of the selected compounds.", "Eight compounds were identified as the most effective natural inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. These compounds are kaempferol 3-galactoside, kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside, mangiferin methyl ether, luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside, quercetin-<i>O</i>-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-3-glucopyranoside, 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate, naringenin, and asphodelin A 4'-<i>O</i>-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside.", "The results of this study provide valuable information for the development of natural product-based drugs against COVID-19. However, the elected compounds should be further studied <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> to confirm their efficacy in treating COVID-19."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2546-8035"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elkaeed", "ForeName": "Eslam B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsfouk", "ForeName": "Bshra A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Design and Discovery Lab, Zewail City of Science and Technology, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Sciences Program, University of Science and Technology, Zewail City of Science and Technology, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Tuqa H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Design and Discovery Lab, Zewail City of Science and Technology, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Sciences Program, University of Science and Technology, Zewail City of Science and Technology, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Arafa", "ForeName": "Reem K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0893-6703"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elkady", "ForeName": "Hazem", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biophysics Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Ibrahim M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Eissa", "ForeName": "Ibrahim H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8566-1980"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biopharmaceutical Products Research Department, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Institute, City of Scientific Research and Technological Applications (SRTA-City), Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Metwaly", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Antivir Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9815705", "ISSNLinking": "1359-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37669909", "10.1177/13596535231199838"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
