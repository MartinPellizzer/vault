Purified lectins are glycoproteins with a native molecular mass of 60 kDa and are made of two types of subunits (Gowda et al., 1994, J.Biol.Chem. 269, 18789-18793) (3). Chemical modifications of various groups in purified lectins (using group specific reagents) such as lysine (citraconic anhydride), carboxyl groups (water soluble carbodiimide) tyrosine (N-acetyl imidazole) and tryptophan (2-hydroxy 5-nitro benzylbromide) revealed that 14 out of 21 residues of lysines 7 out of 92 residues of carboxyl groups, 16 out of 24 tyrosine residues and 2 out of 10 tryptophan residues were modified. Lysine and carboxyl group modification led to 95% loss in haemaglutinating activity compared to control while tyrosine and tryptophan modifications led to complete loss of lectin activity. Arginine and histidine modifications led to only 50% loss in activity. The extent of modification and loss in activity was same when the lysine and carboxyl groups were modified in the presence and absence of the inhibitory sugar methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside at 0.1 M concentration. However protection of modification and lectin activity was observed when the tyrosine and tryptophan residues were modified in the presence of the inhibitory sugar. Earlier CD studies carried out (1) and extensive chemical modification studies reported here substantiate the involvement of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in the sugar binding site of these lectins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Hyderabad, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nadimpalli", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Mol Biol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9306673", "ISSNLinking": "1039-9712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PHA4727WTP", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mannose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10365253", "10.1080/15216549900201913"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
