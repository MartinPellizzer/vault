The Directive has dramatically changed the perspectives. It ensures free circulation of patented biotechnological products harmonising the national legal system of each Member State, guaranteeing compliance with the European Patent Convention signed in Munich on 5th October 1973, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement of 15th April 1994 and the Rio de Janeiro Convention on Biological Diversity of 5th June 1992. The legal basis of the Directive and the fundamental principles of protection are that discoveries as such are not considered patentable. Plant and animal varieties as such, as well as essentially biological procedures for the production of plants and animals are excluded from protection by patent. On the contrary, the new field of patentability covers plants and parts of animals with new introduced genetic characters. Methods of surgical and therapeutic treatment and diagnostic methods applied to animal bodies are not considered inventions suitable for industrial applications and excluded from protection by patents. Biological materials and material isolated from its natural environment and isolated elements of the human body with technical processes may be patented. Excluded from patentability are inventions that are contrary to law and order or public morality as well as processes for human cloning for reproductive purposes and for modifying the germ-line genetic identity of human beings, as well as the use of human embryos. The processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals without any substantial medical benefit for man (with the exception of studying new medicinal products useful for treating serious diseases such as cancer, hepatitis or AIDS, by means of Oanimal modelsO) are also excluded. The rights of farmers are also guaranteed, by allowing them to re-sow seeds and freely use breeding stock covered by patents on their farms, without paying costly royalties to the holders of patents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Direzione Generale Sviluppo Produttivo e Competitivit , (General Management for Production Development and Competition); Ufficio Italiano Brevetti e Marchi, (Italian Patent and Trademark Office), Rome."}], "LastName": "Morelli Gradi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Forum (Genova)", "NlmUniqueID": "9315183", "ISSNLinking": "1121-8142"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "European Union"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10607844"]}}]}
