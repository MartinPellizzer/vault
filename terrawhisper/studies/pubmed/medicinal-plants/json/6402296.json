Transformation by these furocoumarins under the same activation conditions was also investigated in C3H/1OT1/2 cells. In V79 cells, AFB1 induced a 4-fold maximum mutation frequency over controls under BL activation at a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml; marmesin induced a 2-fold increased mutation frequency at 1.5 micrograms/ml; MOP induced a 19-fold increase at 10 micrograms/ml; chalepin induced a 3-fold increase at 5 micrograms/ml; and imperatorin induced a 20-fold increase at 10 micrograms/ml. Essentially no mutation was observed at the ouabain-resistant (Ouar) locus in C3H/1OT1/2 cells with any of these compounds. In the transformation assays, type II and type III foci were observed at a 1-microgram/ml addition of AFB1 with or without BL activation; while with MOP and imperatorin, these types of foci were observed only with BL activation. Marmesin, although relatively more cytotoxic than the other furocoumarins studied, with a 50% lethal dose of less than 0.5 micrograms/ml, was not as mutagenic or potentially carcinogenic as were AFB1, imperatorin, or MOP with BL activation. These furocoumarins are considered to be involved in the etiology of the high incidence of skin cancer in Nigeria. Our experiments reinforce that concept and suggest that exposure to these furocoumarins may constitute a real carcinogenic hazard."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uwaifo", "ForeName": "A O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Billings", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heidelberger", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1-T32-CA-09320", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furocoumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "13164-04-0", "NameOfSubstance": "chalepin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H5D33D6K5D", "NameOfSubstance": "marmesin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K713N25C78", "NameOfSubstance": "imperatorin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U4VJ29L7BQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Methoxsalen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Furocoumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Methoxsalen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6402296"]}}]}
