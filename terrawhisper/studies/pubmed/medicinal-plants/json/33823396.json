In the current study, we report the synthesis of thirteen novel pyrimidopyrrolizine, pyrimidoindolizine, and diazepinopyrrolizine derivatives. The new compounds exhibited cytotoxic activities against MCF7, A2780 and HT29 cancer cell lines (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.02-19.58\u00a0\u03bcM) and MRC5 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.17-20.57 \u03bcM). The six most active compounds (23b, 24a,b and, 31c-e) were evaluated for their MDR reversal activities in MCF7/ADR cells. Mechanistic study using real-time PCR revealed the ability of compound 31c to inhibit P-gp. In addition, compound 31c increased the accumulation of Rho123 inside MCF7/ADR cells in a dose-dependent manner compared to verapamil. Compound 31c arrested the cell cycle of MCF7 cells at the G<sub>1</sub> phase. Compound 31c also caused a significant dose-dependent increase of early and late apoptotic events. Molecular docking analysis revealed a high binding affinity for compound 31c toward P-gp. Like zosuquidar, compound 31c displayed one hydrogen bond and several hydrophobic interactions with amino acids in P-gp. These results indicated that compound 31c represents a potential anticancer candidate with MDR reversal activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
