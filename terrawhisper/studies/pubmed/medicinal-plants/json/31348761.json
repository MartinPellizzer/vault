Method The present study was designed to investigate the antihypertensive activity of aqueous extract of Warionia saharae (WSLAE) in anesthetized L-NAME (N\u03c9-L-arginine methyl ester)-induced rats. The acute and sub-chronic effects of WSLAE on systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were investigated after oral administration of the extract (100 mg/kg body weight of WSLAE) during 6 h for the acute experiment and during 7 days for the sub-chronic test. In addition the effect of WSLAE on the contractile response of isolated rat aortic rings was tested and the role of the vascular receptors was evaluated using several drugs. Results The results showed that WSLAE induced a significant decrease in the systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure and HR in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. Furthermore, this extract induced relaxation in rings pre-contracted with Epinephrine (10 \u00b5M) or with KCl (100 mM). This vasorelaxant capacity seems to be mediated through inhibition of KATP channels and nitric oxide (NO) synthase pathways. Conclusion This study supports the use of Warionia saharae in the management of hypertension in Moroccan traditional medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences and Techniques Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University, BP 509, Boutalamine, BP 21, Errachidia, 52000, Morocco."}], "LastName": "El-Ouady", "ForeName": "Fadwa", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sciences and Techniques Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University, BP 509, Boutalamine, BP 21, Errachidia, 52000, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Eddouks", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "KATP Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "KATP Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morocco"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31348761", "10.1515/jcim-2019-0024", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2019-0024/jcim-2019-0024.xml"]}}]}
