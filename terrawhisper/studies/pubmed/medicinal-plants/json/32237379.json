They were used for G. elata cultivation,and the gene sequence,r DNA-ITS,\u03b2-tubulin and EF1-\u03b1 of four Armillaria strains,were compared and analyzed. The yield was mesured in November which was based on previous laboratory research. The tubers were washed and steamed,then dried and powdered. The content of gastrodin and p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol was determined by UPLC,the polysaccharide was determined by phenol-concentrated sulfuric acid method. The results showed that the strains M1,M2,M3 and M4 were Armillaria gallica group but there were differences in the yield and active ingredient content when they were cultivated with the same G. elata. The yield of G. elata( Jian Ma) was the lowest when cultivated with Armillaria strain M3,but it was not the same when used M1,0. 981 kg\u00b7m-2,the highest yield in the four stains.The content of gastrodin was 0. 581%,the total content of gastrodin and p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol was 0. 595%,when accompanied with M1 strains. It was higher than other strains. The content of G. elata polysaccharide was 2. 132%,which was similar to the content of M3 strain,higher than that of M2 and M4 strain. Selecting phylogenesis of Armillaria strians,the content of active ingredient,and the yield as indicators,it was concluded concerned that the M1 strain was the best of four strains. The results will provide a theoretical basis and guidance for higher yield and quality in cultivation of G. elata in Yiliang."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China Engineering Research Center of Chinese Ministry of Education for Edible and Medicinal Fungi,Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tian-Rui", "Initials": "TR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianma Industry Development Office of Yanliang Yanliang 657600,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Qiao", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiang-Dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianma Industry Development Office of Yanliang Yanliang 657600,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yong-Shu", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianma Industry Development Office of Yanliang Yanliang 657600,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wan-Lei", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of Chinese Ministry of Education for Edible and Medicinal Fungi,Jilin Agricultural University Changchun 130118,China."}], "LastName": "Bao", "ForeName": "Hai-Ying", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Armillaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrodia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237379", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191009.104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
