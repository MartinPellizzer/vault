In all of the chromatograms, 40 peaks were detected; 34 carotenoids were identified. The total carotenoid content of the ripe fruits was about 1.3 g/100 g of dry weight, of which capsanthin constituted 37%, zeaxanthin was 8%, cucurbitaxanthin A was 7%, capsorubin constituted 3.2%, and beta-carotene accounted for 9%. The remainder was composed of capsanthin 5,6-epoxide, capsanthin 3,6-epoxide, 5,6-diepikarpoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, and several cis isomers and furanoid oxides. The possible biosynthetic routes for the formation of minor carotenoids containing 3,5,6-trihydroxy-beta-, 3,6-epoxy-beta-, and 6-hydroxy-gamma-end groups are described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Chemistry, University of P\u00e9cs, Medical School, H-7624 P\u00e9cs, Szigeti \u00fat 12, Hungary. delijos@apacs.pote.hu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deli", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moln\u00e1r", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matus", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "T\u00f3th", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11312889", "10.1021/jf000958d", "jf000958d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
