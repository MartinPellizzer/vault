The new compounds were characterized using modern spectroscopic techniques, including UV spectroscopy, proton nuclear resonance (1HNMR), carbon thirteen nuclear resonance (13CNMR), homomolecular quantum coherance (HMQC), heteromolecular bonding connectivity (HMBC) and chemical ionization mass spectra (CI). The effect on rats urine volume of the plant powder, its ethanolic extract, (500 mg kg(-1)) along with four of the purified compounds (1,4-6), (100 mg kg(-1)) are described. Eight groups of albino rats (200-300 g body weight) (n=5 for each group) were used in the tests for a one-time treatment, and other seven groups (150-180 g body weight) (n=5 for each group) were tested using the same dose with repeated administration for 15 days. The rat sera were collected and used to determine liver and kidney functions based on alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) for both single and repeated administration. Levels of urea, creatinine and uric acid were determined for both sets of experiments. The toxic effects of both the powder and its alcoholic extract were also studied on mice to determine their LD50, both materials proved to be non-toxic up to 2500 mg kg(-1) body weight."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre, El-Tahrir St. Dokki, Cairo, Egypt. nhelsayed@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El-Sayed", "ForeName": "N H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Awaad", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mabry", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15282952"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
