The incidence of liver injury due to acetaminophen overdose, either with suicidal intent or by accident, is increasing. Garlic is among those medicinal plants famous for its different health protective effects. In this study, the protective effects of garlic extract on acute acetaminophen-induced liver injury were investigated using freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. The hepatocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley male rats by a two step collagenase model. Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Glutathione (GSH) depletion were studied after addition of acetaminophen to cell suspensions. The effects of garlic extract on prevention of ROS formation as well as GSH depletion was investigated and compared with the effects of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) as the standard treatment. Reactive oxygen species formation was assessed by a spectrofluorometry method and garlic extract was shown to be as effective as NAC in decreasing ROS formation induced by acetaminophen. Glutathione (GSH) levels of hepatocytes were determined using HPLC. Garlic extract was effective in preventing GSH depletion significantly (p < 0.05). It is concluded that garlic extract has an antioxidant effect and can protect hepatocytes from GSH depletion following NAPQI production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anoush", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eghbal", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fathiazad", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamzeiy", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kouzehkonani", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19806806", "10.3923/pjbs.2009.765.771"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
