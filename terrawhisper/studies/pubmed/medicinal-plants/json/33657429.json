Their structures were elucidated on the basis of NMR, MS, IR, UV spectroscopic data as well as by comparison with the literature. The compound 5-hydroxypyridine-3-carboxamide (9) was isolated for the first time from the Apocynaceae family. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antiparasitic effects against 3D7 and Dd2 strains of Plasmodium falciparum and promastigotes of Leishmania donovani (MHOM/SD/62/1S). Compounds 1-4 possessed good in vitro antimalarial activities against CQR Dd2 with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 4.68 to 5.36\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and moderate on CQS 3D7. Only compounds 1 and 2 showed leishmanicidal activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging between 10.49 and 13.21\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. In addition, crude extract exhibited potent antiplasmodial (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.91 and 3.12\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and antileishmanial (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) activities, thus demonstrating their potential synergistic action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
