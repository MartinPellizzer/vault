Twelve compounds were selected for docking on human \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylaseenzymes using Autodock 4.0 software. Furthermore, the active extract was <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> tested for the antidiabetic activity and then identified usingTLC bioautographic method.", "Eriodictyol was found to have the highest potential as an inhibitor against \u03b1-amylase with binding energy of -9.92\u2009kcal/mol. Rutin was the most potent against \u03b1-glucosidase with binding energy of-9.15\u2009kcal/mol. A considerable number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were computed between the compounds and the enzymes thereby making them energetically favorable and suggesting inhibition of these two enzymes as a plausible molecular mechanism for their antidiabetic effect.", "These two flavonoids could therefore be used as potential leads for structure- based design of new effective hypoglycemic agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Osman", "ForeName": "Wadah", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Esraa M O A", "Initials": "EMOA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Shantier", "ForeName": "Shaza W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Mona S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mothana", "ForeName": "Ramzi A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Muddathir", "ForeName": "Abdelkhalig", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "Hassan S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Recept Signal Transduct Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9509432", "ISSNLinking": "1079-9893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bauhinia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32718219", "10.1080/10799893.2020.1800734"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
