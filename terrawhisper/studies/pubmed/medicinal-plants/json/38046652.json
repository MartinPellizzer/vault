This study aimed at the CADD of a new apoptotic EGFR inhibitor. The natural alkaloid, theobromine, was used as a starting point to obtain a new semisynthetic (di-ortho-chloro acetamide) derivative (<b>T-1-DOCA</b>). Firstly, <b>T-1-DOCA</b>'s total electron density, energy gap, reactivity indices, and electrostatic surface potential were determined by DFT calculations, Then, molecular docking studies were carried out to predict the potential of <b>T-1-DOCA</b> against wild and mutant EGFR proteins. <b>T-1-DOCA</b>'s correct binding was further confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) over 100\u2009ns, MM-GPSA, and PLIP experiments. In vitro, <b>T-1-DOCA</b> showed noticeable efficacy compared to erlotinib by suppressing EGFR<sup>WT</sup> and EGFR<sup>T790M</sup> with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 56.94 and 269.01\u2009nM, respectively. <b>T-1-DOCA</b> inhibited also the proliferation of H1975 and HCT-116 malignant cell lines, exhibiting IC<sub>50</sub> values of 14.12 and 23.39\u2009\u00b5M, with selectivity indices of 6.8 and 4.1, respectively, indicating its anticancer potential and general safety. The apoptotic effects of <b>T-1-DOCA</b> were indicated by flow cytometric analysis and were further confirmed through its potential to increase the levels of BAX, Casp3, and Casp9, and decrease Bcl-2 levels. In conclusion, <b>T-1-DOCA</b>, a new apoptotic EGFR inhibitor, was designed and evaluated both computationally and experimentally. The results suggest that <b>T-1-DOCA</b> is a promising candidate for further development as an anti-cancer drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Eissa", "ForeName": "Ibrahim H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Reda G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elkaeed", "ForeName": "Eslam B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsfouk", "ForeName": "Aisha A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, New Valley University, El-Kharja, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Husein", "ForeName": "Dalal Z", "Initials": "DZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biophysics Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University.
