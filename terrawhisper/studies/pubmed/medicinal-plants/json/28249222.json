In this study, cell suspension culture of W.\u00a0somnifera was elicited with cell homogenates of fungi (A.\u00a0alternata, F.\u00a0solani, V.\u00a0dahliae and P.\u00a0indica) in shake flask and the major withanolides like withanolide A, withaferin A and withanone were analysed. Simultaneously expression levels of key pathway genes from withanolides biosynthetic pathways were also checked via quantitative PCR in shake flask as well as in bioreactor. The results show that highest gene expression of 10.8, 5.8, 4.9, and 3.3 folds were observed with HMGR among all the expressed genes in cell suspension cultures with cell homogenates of 3% P.\u00a0indica, 5% V.\u00a0dahliae, 3% A.\u00a0alternata and 3% F.\u00a0solani, respectively, in comparison to the control in shake flask. Optimized concentration of cell homogenate of P.\u00a0indica (3% v/v) was added to the growing culture in 5.0-l bioreactor under optimized up-scaling conditions and harvested after 22 days. The genes of MVA, MEP and withanolides biosynthetic pathways like HMGR, SS, SE, CAS, FPPS, DXR and DXS were up-regulated by 12.5, 4.9, 2.18, 4.65, 2.34, 1.89 and 1.4 folds, respectively in bioreactor. The enhancement of biomass (1.13 fold) and withanolides [withanolide A (1.7), withaferin A (1.5), and withanone (1.5) folds] in bioreactor in comparison to shake flask was also found to be in line with the up-regulation of genes of withanolide biosynthetic pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
