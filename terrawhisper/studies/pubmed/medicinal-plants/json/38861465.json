From August to October in 2021 and 2022, severe leaf spots symptoms were observed on L. japonica in medicinal botanical garden of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (36\u00b055'89\"N, 116\u00b079'91\"E), Jinan, Shandong Province, China. The disease incidence was above 80% in the 25 acre cultivation area. Early symptoms were small brown spots on the leaves. Then the number of small spots gradually increased and spread over the entire leaves. The small brown spots seldom merge together to form larger lesions. Leaves with typical symptoms were collected from twenty individual plants, and cut into small 5\u00d75 mm fragments in the junction of infected and healthy tissues. The fragments were sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s and 1% NaClO for 60 s, rinsed three times in sterile water, and then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). After 3 days of incubation at 25\u00b0C, fungal plugs along the edge of the colony were cut and transferred to new PDA for purification. A total number of 23 colonies with similar morphological characteristics were obtained, and three representative strains (Lj14, Lj18 and Lj20) were selected for subsequent study. The colonies grew rapidly on PDA and covered the entire petri dish in 4 days. Colonies had abundant aerial hyphae, initially white, round, later turning gray and black. Conidia were oblate or nearly spherical, single-celled, black, and measured in size from 9.6 to 13.2 \u03bcm \u00d7 7.9 to 16.1 \u03bcm in diameter (n=150) (Figure S1). The observed characteristics were close to those of Nigrospora spp. ( Wang et al. 2017). The genomic DNA was extracted, and PCR amplification of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), \u03b2-tubulin gene (TUB), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (TEF1) were completed by primers ITS1/ITS4, Bt2a/Bt2b and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn, 1999). Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. OR936661, OR936662, OR936671 for ITS, OR947626, OR947627, OR947628 for TUB, and OR947629, OR947630, OR947631 for TEF1 sequences, respectively). BLAST analyses of ITS (OR936661), TUB(OR947626) and TEF1 (OR947629) sequences exhibited 100% (487 bp out of 487 bp), 99.48% (380 bp out of 382 bp), and 99.6% (248 bp out of 249 bp) similarity to the sequences of N. oryzae strains KoLRI_053384 (MZ855426), LC2991 (KY019496) and LC7307 (KY019409), respectively. Lj14, Lj18 and Lj20 formed a clade with N. oryzae LC6763 and LC2991 in phylogenetic tree (Figure S2). Based on morphological and molecular evidence, the pathogen was identified as N. oryzae (Berk. &Broome) Petch. To fulfill Koch's postulates, the pathogenicity was tested in vivo experiments. Thirty non-wounded healthy leaves of ten intact plants were inoculated with 10 \u00b5l spore suspension (10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml) of three strains, respectively. As negative control, thirty leaves of ten healthy plants were inoculated with sterile water. The inoculated plants were placed at 28\u00b0C in the growth chamber with high relative humidity. The pathogenicity tests were repeated three times. Distinct symptoms similar to that of natural conditions were observed on the leaves of inoculated plants after 4 to 7 days. The strain was reisolated from the lesions and identified as N. oryzae by morphological features and ITS sequence. The pathogen has been reported to cause leaf spot disease on tobacco (Wang et al. 2022) and asiatic dayflower (Qiu et al. 2022). To our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot caused by N. oryzae on Lonicera japonica in China. The research will be helpful for leaf spot disease control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; xchenaylli@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; 2807464803@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; 18663553162@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yanlei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; 18754621424@163.com."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yanan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; lhyan0@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hongyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; zyq622003@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yongqing", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; white_byh1122@163.com."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Yanhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; 2225764500@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Fengxia", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China; cleanlq@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38861465", "10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0190-PDN"]}}]}
