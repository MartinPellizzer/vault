Scrophulariae Radix (SR) is the dried roots of SNH, and is one of the most commonly used medicinal parts of SNH, and is an essential traditional medicine and widely used in East Asia for more than 2000 years. SR is used for clearing away heat and cooling blood, nourishing Yin and reducing fire, detoxicating and resolving a mass. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control and pharmacokinetics of SNH based on the surveyed and summarized literature.", "Up to now, iridoids, phenolic glycosides, phenolic acids, alkaloids, flavonoids, triterpenes and other compounds have been isolated and identified from SNH. The extract and chemical components of SNH exerts multiple pharmacological effects, such as hepatoprotective effect, anti-inflammatory effect, neuroprotective effect, anti-ventricular remodeling effect and other activities. Various methods have been developed for the quality control of SNH, mainly for SR. Some bioactive compounds in SNH exhibited different pharmacokinetic behaviours and individual metabolic transformation profiles.", "This review will contribute to understanding the correlation between the pharmacological activities and the traditional usage of SNH, and useful to rational use and drug development in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Crown copyright 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry and Quality Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry and Quality Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "An", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry and Quality Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuesheng", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scrophularia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33772290", "10.1093/jpp/rgaa036", "6151628"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
