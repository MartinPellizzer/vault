Scoparone, which is extracted from the medicinal plant Artemisia capillaris, has potent acaricidal effects on Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Spirodiclofen, derived from a tetronic acid derivative, is a potent commercial acaricide that is extensively used globally. However, whether scoparone has synergistic effects when used in conjunction with spirodiclofen and the underlying synergistic mechanism remains unclear.", "Scoparone exhibited a potent synergistic effect when it was combined with spirodiclofen at a 1:9 ratio. Subsequently, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) activity, RNA-Seq and qPCR assays indicated that the enzyme activity of P450 and the expression of one P450 gene from T. cinnabarinus, TcCYP388A1, were significantly inhibited by scoparone and spirodiclofen + scoparone; conversely, P450 was activated in spirodiclofen-exposed mites. Importantly, RNAi-mediated silencing of the TcCYP388A1 gene markedly increased the susceptibility of spider mites to spirodiclofen, scoparone and spirodiclofen + scoparone, and in vitro, the recombinant TcCYP388A1 protein could metabolize spirodiclofen. Molecular docking and functional analyses further indicated that R117, which is highly conserved in Arachnoidea species, may be a vital specific binding site for scoparone in the mite TcCYP388A1 protein. This binding site was subsequently confirmed using mutagenesis data, which revealed that this binding site was the sole site selected by scoparone in spider mites over mammalian or fly CYP388A1.", "These results indicate that the synergistic effects of scoparone and spirodiclofen on mites occurs through the inhibition of P450 activity, thus reducing spirodiclofen metabolism. The synergistic effect of this potent natural product on the detoxification enzyme-targeted activity of commercial acaricides may offer a sustainable strategy for pest mite resistance management.
