Astilbin is a dihydroflavonol derivative found in many medicinal and food plants with multiple pharmacological functions. To investigate the effects of astilbin on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI), cecal ligation and puncture was performed on rats to establish a sepsis-induced ALI model; these rats were then treated with astilbin at different concentrations. Lung injury scores, including lung wet/dry ratio, protein leakage, myeloperoxidase activity, and inflammatory cell infiltration were determined to evaluate the effects of astilbin on sepsis-induced ALI. We found that astilbin treatment significantly attenuates sepsis-induced lung injury and improves survival rate, lung injury scores, lung wet/dry ratio, protein leakage, myeloperoxidase activity, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Astilbin treatment also dramatically decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Further, astilbin treatment inhibited the expression and production of macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), which inhibits the inflammatory response. Collectively, these data suggest that astilbin has a protective effect against sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting MIF-mediated inflammatory responses. This study provides a molecular basis for astilbin as a new medical treatment for sepsis-induced ALI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hong-Bo", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Li-Chao", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi", "ForeName": "Li-da", "Initials": "LD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Qian-Kuan", "Initials": "QK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Zhi-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Sheng-Tao", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Critical Care Medicine Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Emergency Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 2 Yinghua Dongjie, Hepingli, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100029, China. guo_qiang_zhang@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guo-Qiang", "Initials": "GQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29838-67-3", "NameOfSubstance": "astilbin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.2.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Mif protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonols"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sepsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28840536", "10.1007/s12272-016-0857-y", "10.1007/s12272-016-0857-y"]}}]}
