Encephalopathology, senility, and lower statistical longevity were found to be geographically and geochemically linked to acid soil conditions. We examined the interrelation of soil environmental supply of Al3+(6H2O) to the food-plant-animal-human chain (e.g., in tea leaves, approximately 1000 mg L-1) and to identified health hazards. Because F forms a strong ligand with Al, we also analyzed the extent that F accumulation is associated with Al accumulation in plants such as tea. Food and medicinal intake of Al needs to be considered in relation to kidney weakness and Al accumulation in humans. Acid soil and plant management could be modified to reduce the hazard of Al in senile dementia (2 to 4 percent of persons age greater than 65 years) and in diseases of the central nervous system endemic in certain acid soil areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jackson", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dementia"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6879151", "10.1016/s0048-9697(83)80024-2", "S0048-9697(83)80024-2"]}}]}
