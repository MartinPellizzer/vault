From this search, they have begun to study about 30. There are already 3 plants which show definite promise. 1 is the Mexican plant montanoa tomentosa, which is also called zoapatle. Zoapatle is an orally active uterotonic agent which seems to offer the advantage over prostaglandin of having very few side effects. A tea made with the zoapatle plant has been tested in Stockholm with good results. Some Paraguayan plants which interfere with the ovulatory process are also under study at the Research and Training Centre in Buenos Aires. And in Hong Kong, the leonorus artemesia, or Chinese mothewort, shows promise as a contraceptive. WHO hopes to get several new contraceptive agents within the next 5 or 6 years based on these studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "full text"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Population (NY)", "NlmUniqueID": "9875061", "ISSNLinking": "0251-8996"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "World Health Organization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12260866"]}}]}
