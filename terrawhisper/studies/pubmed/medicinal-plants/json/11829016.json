The books of Dioscurides and Galen on pharmacological matters became the decisive books of pharmacological translated literature and they formed the basis of the pharmacological understanding in the subsequent extensive literature on pharmacognosy and pharmacology written in Arabic. Nevertheless the Arabs united these two disciplines in a regular pharmacy and they evolved it as an independent discipline, which although attached to medicine was regarded as having its own praxis. The physicians and scientists rationalized and systematized their knowledge of medicinal plants and drugs and extended their knowledge by using original observations and research. Many books on medicaments were written, both as materia medica, i.e. records on simple drugs, and dispensatories, i.e. books on compounded drugs. These two kinds of books were always written separately as they were seen by the Arabs themselves as pertaining to two different subdisciplines, which meant that they were separated too in independent chapters or books in general Arabic works on medicine. When the extensive translations of Arabic medical literature to Latin took place in Italy and Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries, the Arabic pharmacological literature was of course also translated, and its decisive influence on later medieval European medical writings is easy to demonstrate. In the 18th century Peter Forsskaal was one of the first Europeans in the modern scientific tradition to collect and make notes on drugs used in Cairo and in Yemen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Proven\u00e7al", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Den arabiske farmakologi og dens overf\u00f8rsel til Europa - Den arabiske farmakologis forudsaetninger - arven fra Graekenland."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Dan Medicinhist Arbog", "NlmUniqueID": "0434570", "ISSNLinking": "0084-9588"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Arab World"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Denmark"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greek World"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Early Modern 1451-1600"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Modern 1601-"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transfer, Psychology"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Forsskaal", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11829016"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
