According to the pharmacological results,with composite score of extraction rate of tanshinone II(A) and dry extract rate as comprehensive evaluation indexes, orthogonal test was used to optimize the ethanol extraction technology by taking ethanol concentration, the amount of ethanol, extraction time and soaking time. With extraction rate of salvianolic acid B and dry extract yield as comprehensive evaluation indexes, effect of extraction times, the amount of water, and extraction time on water extraction technology were investigated by orthogonal test.", "Optimum ethanol extraction technology conditions were as follows: extracted once with ten times the amount of 80% ethanol, 1.5 h. Optimum water extraction technology conditions were as follows: extracted three times with eight times the amount of water, 1 h each time. The best ethanol precipitated technique was the relative density of the liquor to be condensed to 1.20 (60 degrees C), adding 95% ethanol to 80% of ethanol concentration and depositing for 24 h.", "Optimized extraction technology is simple, stable and feasible,which can settle foundation for molding technology of Huoxuehuayu granules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-jie", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Luo-lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu-xing", "Initials": "YX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25857170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
