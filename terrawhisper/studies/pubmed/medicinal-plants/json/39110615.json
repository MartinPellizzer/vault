Rehd) is an evergreen root-climbing vine, widely cultivated in eastern Asia because of its ornamental, environmental, and medicinal value (Wu et al. 2019). In October 2023, the leaf spot symptom of Ivy was observed in the Kunming Botanical Garden in Yunnan Province, China (25.14\u00b0N, 102.75\u00b0E), and the disease incidence was up to 38% (76 of 200 leaves). Initially, dark-brown or black small spots appeared on the leaves. As the lesions progressed, their center emerged tawny, and the black halos were expanded around the lesions. In severe cases, small spots could link together to form leaf blight even resulting in blade death. In order to obtain pure isolates, 10 diseased leaves were collected and cut into 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm pieces, surface disinfected with 75 % ethanol for 30 s, followed by 3% NaClO for 3 min, and finally washed three times with sterilized water. The pieces were placed on the potato dextrose agar (PDA) media, which was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 3 days. Individual hyphal tips from the developing fungal colonies were placed on PDA and incubated for 5 to 10 days. Six strains (6 out of 10) were obtained with same colony morphology. Conidia were hyaline, unicellular, nonseptate, ellipsoidal or fusiform, thin walled, externally smooth and ranged from 15.0 to 22.0 (avg. 18.4) \u03bcm \u00d7 5.0 to 8.0 (avg. 7.2) \u03bcm (n=30). Morphological comparison proposed that the present fungi belonged to Neofusicoccum (Zhang et al. 2021). Two isolates (GUCC23-0141 and GUCC23-0142) were selected for multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. The PCR reaction of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (EF1-\u03b1), and \u03b2-tubulin genes were run using primers ITS1/ ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/ EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), and Bt2a/ Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995). The accession numbers of DNA sequences of GUCC23-0141 and GUCC23-0142 are ITS: PP728109 and PP728110; TUB2: PP744490 and PP744491; and TEF1-\u03b1: PP744488 and PP744489. BLAST analysis showed 100% identity for ITS and TUB2, and 98.97% for TEF1-\u03b1 with the Neofusicoccum yunnanense (CSF6142). Phylogenetic analyses also supported that our isolates kept a close relationship to N. yunnanense. Three one-year plants were used for pathogenicity test, two of which were inoculated with PDA plugs containing N. yunnanense and one of which was inoculated with blank PDA plugs and used as control. For each plant, three leaves were selected to conduct the test, whose surfaces were sterilized with 75% alcohol. All the leaves were covered with cotton moistened with sterilized water on top. All plants were placed in a greenhouse with 25\u2103 and 75% humidity. Few small black spots were observed at the inoculation site after 3 days, which were enlarged gradually after 7 days. However, control plants remained healthy. N. yunnanense was reisolated from the diseased tissues and identified based on morphological and molecular characteristics. On basis of pathogen identification and Koch's test, we proposed the leaf spot of Ivy caused by N. yunnanense. This was the first report about N. yunnanense causing the disease of Ivy. This result provides a theoretical basis for further research into the control of the disease. As an important ornamental plant, we should pay attention to the management of this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Guiyang, , Guiyang, Guizhou, China; rickywrr@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xing-Chang", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Guiyang, , Guiyang, Guizhou, China; 965326389@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shiqi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guiyang, China, 550025; 18508513887@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuru", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Guiyang, , Guiyang, Guizhou, China; 3072606721@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Mu", "ForeName": "Xianzhou", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Pathology, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, 550025; yongwangbis@aliyun.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39110615", "10.1094/PDIS-06-24-1286-PDN"]}}]}
