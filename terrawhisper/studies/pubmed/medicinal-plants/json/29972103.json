Man needs food to continue living, daily activities, and even the metabolism of food; and appetite plays an important role in receiving foods. Appetite and weight reducing synthetic drugs, which are mostly costly and have significant side effects, are recommended for some patients, and have limited effectiveness in the treatment of obesity. Given the epidemic of obesity and the lack of satisfaction with synthetic drugs these days, people are more likely to use herbal medicines. Complementary medicine has always been considered for the choice of new treatment. This medicine has a long history. Persian Medicine is one of the traditional medicine systems. This study was a qualitative study on the Books of Canon and the Makhzan Al-Aladvia. Saffron has been introduced in both modern medicine and in Iranian medicine to reduce appetite. In the case of Purslane seed and Chio nut, Figs, Sesame seeds, Camphor, and Solomon's seal, and Opium poppy, which have been appetite suppressant in traditional medicine books, in the books and articles of modern medicine, they have not proved to be appetite reducing. Modern medicine has known Gourd as a weight reducing food with the effects on fat but there is no talk about its effects on appetite. According to traditional Iranian medicine, Chio nut causes anorexia due to weakness in the stomach. Therefore, it is not advisable for weight loss. More clinical studies are conducted to prove the effects of appetite suppressant and weight loss effects of these herbal medicines seem logical."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1516745811, Iran."}], "LastName": "Parsa", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1516745811, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mokaberinejad", "ForeName": "Roshanak", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1516745811, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodadoost", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, School of Nursing, Aja University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zareiyan", "ForeName": "Armin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1516745811, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mojahedi", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing Zanjan Branch, Islamic Azad University, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yaghmaei", "ForeName": "Farideh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1516745811, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Parisa", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1516745811, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hakimi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Appetite Depressants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29972103", "10.2174/1570163815666180704093151", "CDDT-EPUB-91481"]}}]}
