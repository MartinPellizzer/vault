In particular, it was evaluated the proximate composition (moisture, ash, crude protein, fat, total carbohydrates, and total energy), \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ergothioneine (ERG), amino acid content of mycelia of 16 higher Basidiomycetes MM species. The results obtained demonstrate that almost all tested combinations were found to be good sources of polysaccharides, with content varying in the ranges of 4.73 \u00b1 1.33% and 58.46 \u00b1 4.15%. Total protein contents varied in 1.97 \u00b1 0.40% - 5.37 \u00b1 0.40% range. ERG was detected in all tested samples, while GABA existed only in eight samples out of 15 and varied from 0.03 \u00b1 < 0.01 to 0.61 \u00b1 0.03 mg/g, and from 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 to 5.69 \u00b1 0.41 mg/g respectively. Analyses of total phenolic and flavonoid contents demonstrate considerable content in all samples (15.53 \u00b1 0.23 - 18.88 \u00b1 0.34 mg gallic acid equivalents/g and 1.23 \u00b1 0.04 - 4.34 \u00b1 0.73 mg rutin equivalents/g respectively). In present research the complexity of samples/extracts were evaluated by multiple antioxidant assays to verify their antioxidant capacity. Determination of in vitro antioxidant activity was successfully carried out by several different methods such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity, reducing power, chelating ability, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothi-azoline-6-sulfonic acid scavenging activity. Therefore, all tested samples confirm the capable antioxidant activities of bioactive compounds extracted from MMs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.; Chia-Tai Biotechnology Co., Tainan 702, Taiwan, R.O.C."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Chi-Wei", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."}], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Yu-Ching", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Liang-Yin", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute of Microbial Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Georgia, 0131 Tbilisi, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Asatiani", "ForeName": "Mikheil", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute of Microbial Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Georgia, 0131 Tbilisi, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Elisashvili", "ForeName": "Vladimir I", "Initials": "VI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cannabotech Ltd., Rishon Lezion 7582014, Israel."}], "LastName": "Klarsfeld", "ForeName": "Gadi", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cannabotech Ltd., Rishon Lezion 7582014, Israel."}], "LastName": "Melamed", "ForeName": "Dobroslav", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cannabotech Ltd., Rishon Lezion 7582014, Israel."}], "LastName": "Fares", "ForeName": "Basem", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center for Cryptogamic Plants and Fungi, Department of Evolutionary and Environmental Biology and Institute of Evolution, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel, Haifa 31905, Israel."}], "LastName": "Wasser", "ForeName": "Solomon P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung-Hsing University, 145 Xingda Road, Taichung 40227, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Mau", "ForeName": "Jeng-Leun", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mycelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34587422", "10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2021039339", "7b96008930594b0e,36fb68422645738b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
