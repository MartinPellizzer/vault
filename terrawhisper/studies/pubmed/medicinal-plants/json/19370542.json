Thus, the mechanisms by which Achyrocline satureioides (AS), a popular South American medicinal plant, protects cells and neurons in culture, are still unclear. In this sense, a recently described trophic capacity for flavonoids, similar to that evoked by growth factors, could be one of the mechanisms involved in AS cellular protection. Since this trophic activity causes differentiation of PC12 cells, the cell differentiation capacity of AS and some of its flavonoids were evaluated. PC12 cells were treated with AS infusion (10 or 20 microg/mL of total polyphenols), quercetin (Q) (12.5 or 25 microm), luteolin (L) (25 microm), Q + L (12.5 microm each one) or nerve growth factor (NGF) for 3 days. Four morphological parameters (percentage of cells with neurites longer than one cell body diameter, percentage of cells with neurites, average number of neurites per cell and percentage of fusiform cells) were explored. The AS infusion showed differentiation capacity on all parameters with similar potency when compared with NGF. Besides, AS was more potent than some of its constituent flavonoids: Q, L or their combination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurochemistry, Instituto de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uruguay. fblasina@iibce.edu.uy"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blasina", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vaamonde", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morquio", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Echeverry", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arredondo", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dajas", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nerve Growth Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Achyrocline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Growth Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neurites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19370542", "10.1002/ptr.2607"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
