Isorhamnetin is a bioflavonoid that is found in medicinal plants like <i>Hippophae rhamnoides L.</i> and <i>Ginkgo biloba L.</i> with promising potential to regulate inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the possible effect of isorhamnetin in prevention of APAP-induced ALI and analyzed further the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation-associated factors. Male C57BL/6 mice were given isorhamnetin (25 or 100\u2009mg/kg b.w., <i>p.o.</i>) three times at 48, 24, and 1\u2009h before APAP administration (300\u2009mg/kg b.w., <i>i.p.</i>). Functional indicators of liver injury were measured as well as analysis of oxidative stress- and inflammation-associated indices and liver histopathology was also conducted. Isorhamnetin at the higher dose of 100\u2009mg/kg significantly lowered serum levels of ALT, ALP, and AST in addition to reduction of ROS, TBARS, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, NF-kB, NLRP3, caspase 1, and MPO and significantly prevented reduction of GSH, SOD activity, sirtuin 1, and Nrf2. Additionally, isorhamnetin alleviated pathological changes of the liver tissue and suitably reversed NF-kB and Nrf2 immunoreactivity. These findings show protective effect of isorhamnetin against acetaminophen-induced liver injury through reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and pyroptosis which is attributed to its regulation of NF-kB, Nrf2, NLRP3, and sirtuin 1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
