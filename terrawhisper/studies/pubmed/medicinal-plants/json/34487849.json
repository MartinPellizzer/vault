The plants of this family have played an essential role in the ethnopharmacological as well as traditional medicinal system globally and their evidence is well established in several traditional literatures. Various plant parts have been used to treat several human ailments viz. Pandu (anemia), Pliharoga (splenomegaly), Sopha (inflammation), Gulma (tumor growth), Adhmana (indigestion. acidity), Garavisa (poisoning) etc. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review article aims to systematically document and bridge scientific evidences with the ethnopharmacological, ethnoveterinary and folklore claims along with the therapeutic efficacy with mechanism of action found in different literature, books, and scientific articles belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.", "To construct the manuscript a comprehensive literature review was done based on the information collected from Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India; books, research articles and databases such as ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, SciFinder, Scopus, Springer, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ACS Publications and PubMed.", "The plants of Cucurbitaceae family are rich in phytochemicals like terpenoids, glycosides, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, steroids, etc., responsible for the therapeutic effect. Various parts of these plants such as leaves, stems, flowers, fruits, seeds, roots etc. exhibit a plethora of pharmacological activity viz. hypolipidemic, antihyperglycemic, anticancer, antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-stress and immunomodulatory activities. Also, in-vitro and in-vivo reports suggest strong inhibitory potential against \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase, lipase, carbonic anhydrase enzyme along with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-tumor, antifungal, etc. Furthermore many reports suggest these plants are beneficial for nutritional, economical and ethnoveterinary uses.", "The current review enlightens the therapeutic potential of the gourd family, comprising of the geographical origins, morphology, phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, ethnoveterinary, nutritional importance, therapeutic benefits, safety, efficacy and related aspects. The phytochemical and pharmacological potential indicated will popularize this family as a potential source of novel therapeutic agents and functional foods. This study will help to validate the therapeutic claims of several ethnomedicinal uses of this plant family. Furthermore the Cucurbitaceae family needs to be evaluated based on the combine approaches of chemoprofiling and bioexploration to develop the concept of food as medicine for the development of new generation therapeutics leading to the human wellness."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
