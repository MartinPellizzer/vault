This investigation focused on two Carpobrotus species belonging to the family, Aizoaceae, in an attempt to assess their antimicrobial potential. Extracts of varying polarities of the plants were prepared and tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Mycobacterium smegmatis. For the disc diffusion method, Ciprofloxacin (40 microg/disc) served as positive control for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and M. smegmatis, whereas amphotericin B (25 microg/disc) was the control for C. albicans. A sample concentration of 10 mg/ml was used. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by two-fold serial dilution. Phytochemical analysis was completed to test for the presence of flavonoids, hydrolysable tannins, phytosterols and aromatic acids. The ethyl acetate extracts (21 microl of 95 mg/ml) were used for bio-autography, together with TLC analyses. Carpobrotus muirii and Carpobrotus quadrifidus showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and M. smegmatis in the disc diffusion method and inhibition against S. aureus and M. smegmatis was observed by clear zones on the TLC plate. This investigation confirms that extracts of these Carpobrotus species that are used as indigenous medicines, exhibit anti-bacterial activity. This scientific information can serve as an important platform for the development of inexpensive, safe and effective natural anti-infective medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South African Traditional Medicines Research Group, School of Pharmacy, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Springfield", "ForeName": "E P", "Initials": "EP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amabeoku", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weitz", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mabusela", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mesembryanthemum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium smegmatis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12834010", "10.1078/0944-7113-00263", "S0944-7113(04)70245-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
