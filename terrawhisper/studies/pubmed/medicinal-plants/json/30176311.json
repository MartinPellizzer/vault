The progressively escalating rates of overweight and obesity worldwide have led to an introduction of a new term \"globesity\". Excessive accumulation of body fat and especially of visceral adipose tissue is the main predisposing factor for the development of metabolic syndrome and other obesity related co-morbidities. At the present moment only few pharmacotherapeuticals are used for long-term treatment of obesity acting on narrow target spectra, e.g. pancreatic and gastric lipase inhibition, acting as adrenomimetics or activating the satiety centers in hypothalamus. Plant-based medications that accelerate weight loss, proved to be safe, effective and widely available, would be a preferable alternative for anti-obesity treatments. As plant extracts are multi-component systems they could also act by more than one mechanism, including decreased lipid absorption, decreased energy intake, increased energy expenditure, decreased pre-adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, decreased lipogenesis and increased lipolysis. The current review gives a summary of the risk factors for obesity development and its characteristics consequences. Current treatment options, combining lifestyle changes and conventional treatment with commercial anti-obesity drugs have been described as well. Special emphasis on in vitro, in vivo and human studies, of potential medicinal plant extracts and phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, able to modulate the molecular pathways and gene/protein expressions related to obesity, have been highlighted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
