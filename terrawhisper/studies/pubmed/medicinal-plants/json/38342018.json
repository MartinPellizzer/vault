Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MI/R) comprise a sequence of detrimental incidents following myocardial ischemia. Research indicates that flavonoids have the potential to act as cardioprotective agents against MI/R injuries. Several specific flavonoids, e.g., luteolin, hesperidin, quercetin, kaempferol, and puerarin, have demonstrated cardioprotective activities in animal models.", "The objective of this review is to identify the cardioprotective flavonoids, investigate their mechanisms of action, and explore their application in myocardial ischemia.", "A search of PubMed database and Google Scholar was conducted using keywords \"myocardial ischemia\" and \"flavonoids\". Studies published within the last 10 years reporting on the cardioprotective effects of natural flavonoids on animal models were analyzed.", "A total of 55 natural flavonoids were identified and discussed within this review. It can be summarized that flavonoids regulate the following main strategies: antioxidation, anti-inflammation, calcium modulation, mitochondrial protection, ER stress inhibition, anti-apoptosis, ferroptosis inhibition, autophagy modulation, and inhibition of adverse cardiac remodeling. Additionally, the number and position of OH, 3'4'-catechol, C2=C3, and C4=O may play a significant role in the cardioprotective activity of flavonoids.", "This review serves as a reference for designing a daily diet to prevent or reduce damages following ischemia and screening of flavonoids for clinical application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
