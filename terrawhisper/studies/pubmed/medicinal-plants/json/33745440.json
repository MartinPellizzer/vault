The occurrence of the recent pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, caused by lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is one such example. Rapid research and development of drugs for the treatment and management of these diseases have become an incredibly challenging task for the pharmaceutical industry. Although, substantial attention has been paid to the discovery of therapeutic compounds from natural sources having significant medicinal potential, their synthesis has made a slow progress. Hence, the discovery of new targets by the application of the latest biotechnological and synthetic biology approaches is very much the need of the hour. Polyketides (PKs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) found in bacteria, fungi and plants are a diverse family of natural products synthesized by two classes of enzymes: polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). These enzymes possess immense biomedical potential due to their simple architecture, catalytic capacity, as well as diversity. With the advent of the latest in-silico and in-vitro strategies, these enzymes and their related metabolic pathways, if targeted, can contribute highly towards the biosynthesis of an array of potentially natural drug leads that have antagonist effects on biopolymers associated with various human diseases. In the face of the rising threat from multidrug-resistant pathogens, this will further open new avenues for the discovery of novel and improved drugs by combining natural and synthetic approaches. This review discusses the relevance of polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides and the improvement strategies for the development of their derivatives and scaffolds, and how they will be beneficial for future bioprospecting and drug discovery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Transdisciplinary Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological Environmental Rural Sciences (IBERS), Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Girija", "ForeName": "Aiswarya", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Transdisciplinary Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Centre - Institute of Plant Molecular Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, 370 05, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Vijayanathan", "ForeName": "Mallika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Transdisciplinary Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre, University of Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Sreekumar", "ForeName": "Sweda", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, PD Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Basheer", "ForeName": "Jasim", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Transdisciplinary Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Menon", "ForeName": "Tara G", "Initials": "TG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, PD Hills, Kottayam, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Krishnankutty", "ForeName": "Radhakrishnan E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Transdisciplinary Biology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Soniya", "ForeName": "Eppurathu V", "Initials": "EV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Mol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101467997", "ISSNLinking": "1874-4672"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyketides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyketides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33745440", "10.2174/1874467214666210319145816", "CMP-EPUB-114964"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
