Plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are currently being considered as a critical risk factor for the diseases mentioned above, especially atherosclerosis. Because of the heterogeneous nature of LDL, many studies have already been conducted on its subclasses, especially small dense LDL (sdLDL). According to available evidence, sdLDL levels can be considered as an ideal alternative to LDL levels for monitoring CVD and early diagnosis of atherosclerosis. Recently, several researchers have focused on factors that are able to decrease sdLDL levels and improve health quality. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe the production process of sdLDL particles and review the effects of pharmaceutical and dietary agents as well as lifestyle on sdLDL plasma levels. In brief, their mechanisms of action are discussed. Apparently, cholesterol and LDL-lowering compounds are also effective in the reduction of sdLDL levels. In addition, improving lipid profile, especially the reduction of triglyceride levels, appropriate regimen, and lifestyle can decrease sdLDL levels. Therefore, all the aforementioned parameters should be taken into consideration simultaneously in sdLDL levels reducing strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0448-7074"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran1449614535,Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Alizadeh-Fanalou", "ForeName": "Shahin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran1449614535,Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Nazarizadeh", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran131451365,Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Alian", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran131451365,Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Faraji", "ForeName": "Parisa", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1449614535, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Sorori", "ForeName": "Bahareh", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9815-7695"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Islamic Azad University, Qom Branch, Qom3714668669,Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Khosravi", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9700112", "ISSNLinking": "1431-6730"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32427116", "10.1515/hsz-2019-0426", "/j/bchm.just-accepted/hsz-2019-0426/hsz-2019-0426.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
