Three nonlactating Holstein cows, fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas, were given ad libitum access to alfalfa hay. One gram (DM) of alfalfa, rhizoma peanut, dwarf elephantgrass, bahiagrass, bermudagrass, and limpograss was individually weighed into 8-cm x 3-cm dacron bags. After ruminal incubation for 24 h, bags were incubated in an acid-pepsin solution (a simulated abomasal environment) for 1 h, inserted into the duodenum via cannula, and collected in the feces upon excretion. Ruminal incubation accounted for 86% to 100% of total DM disappearance. Release of Ca from all forages was at least 65%, with the majority having extents of release of over 70%. Most Ca was released in the rumen, but acid-pepsin incubation and washing increased Ca release an additional 17 to 272%. Forages with the highest NDF concentration (bermuda, bahia, and limpograss) sequestered Ca in the intestines. Total tract P release ranged from 84 to 98%, with an average of 7.5 percentage units occurring postabomasally. Grasses released more P in the intestines than legumes. Eighty-eight to 98% of total Mg was released in the rumen. Acid-pepsin incubation increased Mg release only slightly, with some Mg being sequestered in the intestines. Potassium release was complete in the rumen. Ranking of minerals based on maximal extent of release was K greater than Mg greater than P greater than Ca. With the exception of K, legumes released more of their minerals than grasses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dairy Sci.
