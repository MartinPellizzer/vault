Generally, the synthesized compounds showed better cytotoxicity towards A-549 and Hep-G2 than MCF-7. Among them, (2E)-2-{[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]methylidene}-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (8l) was found to be the most potent compound against A-549 and Hep-G2, at least three times more potent than etoposide. The morphological analysis by the acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining test and flow cytometry analysis indicated that compound 8l induced apoptosis in A-549 cells. Moreover, molecular docking methodology was exploited to elucidate the details of molecular interactions of the studied compounds with putative targets."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019
