The substantial development of the worldwide natural botanical market is attributable to the expanding revenue of global drug companies trading herbal medicines. This essential type of traditional medical care is depended on by approx. 72-80% of individuals. Even though numerous restorative plants are readily used, they have never been subject to the same strict quality guidelines as conventional drugs. Nonetheless, it is vital to have specific organic, phytochemical, and molecular tools and methods for identifying restorative plant species so that traditional and novel plant products can be safely used in modern medicine. Molecular biotechnology approaches provide a reliable and accurate way to identify botanicals and can be used to ensure the safety and efficacy of plant-based products. This review explores various molecular biotechnology approaches and methods for identifying botanicals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Imran", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Translational and Clinical Research, School of Chemical and Life Sciences, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Majid", "ForeName": "Haya", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Riaz", "ForeName": "Tasha", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Maqsood", "ForeName": "Shayan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Polim Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7509477", "ISSNLinking": "0370-0747"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37338286", "10.17219/pim/163119"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
