Kinetic studies of growth, nutrient consumption, pH variation, and paclitaxel accumulation were conducted in batch cultures and semicontinuous culture with total cell recycle. A dramatic increase of paclitaxel was obtained when the cultures were elicited with 100 microM MJ, but cell growth was thereby arrested. Supplementation of acetyl-CoA and MJ to the culture proved to be another way to improve paclitaxel yields. Using semicontinuous culture with total cell recycle, paclitaxel accumulation was increased by a factor of 4.0 relative to that in the batch culture during 35 days of cultivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA."}], "LastName": "Phisalaphong", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Linden", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10585192", "10.1021/bp990098p", "bp990098p"]}}]}
