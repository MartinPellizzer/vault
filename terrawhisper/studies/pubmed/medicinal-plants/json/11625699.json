The plants were collected by members of the poorest and least educated social groups, who had little knowledge about the plants they collected and were interested mainly in easy gain. This led to the depletion of many stands of medicinal plants. Scientists, like Wladyslaw Szafer, supported the collecting of medicinal plants at first, but once they realised its wasteful effects, they began to make efforts to protect the natural resources of medicinal plants. In the 1930s the collecting of plants growing in the wild was being gradually replaced by the cultivation of such plants. At the same time, herb collectors were being registered and trained. The 1934 act on the protection of nature also contributed to preserving medicinal plants in the wild."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Magowska", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Z historii zielarstwa w okresie miedzywojennym.
