(T3) Total N, available N, available P and available K in AM soil were all lower than in CK soil. (4) GC-MS analysis showed organic matters changed differenly in AM soil and CK soil, components 5,6 in AM soil were higher than that in CK soil, but component 9, 10, 11 were lower in AM soil than that in CK soil.
