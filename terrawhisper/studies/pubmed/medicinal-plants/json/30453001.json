Citronellol (CT) is a monoterpene alcohol present in the essential oil of several plants used in cooking and traditional medicine, such as those of the genus Cymbopogon and Citrus, with pharmacological activities already described in the literature. The aim of this review was to summarize the pharmacological activities already attributed to CT that could be used in treatments for humans. The databases PubMed, MedLine, Scopus, Lilacs and Scielo were searched using the terms \"Citronellol\" and \"Drug effect\". 32 articles were identified and used in the study. Twenty-one articles demonstrated CT activities, including antibiotic and antifungal effects in vitro, and 11 properties including analgesic and anticonvulsant effects in vivo, besides presenting low toxicity. In view of the need to discover new drugs and the activities reported for CT, it can be stated that CT is a promising molecule to target in future pharmacological studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
