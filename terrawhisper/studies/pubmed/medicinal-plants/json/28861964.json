It showed that phenotypic traits variation of different S. baicalensis strains was rich and the F value ranged from 3.169 to 71.58. The difference was significant between each other and germplasm 15 performs the most outstanding characters. Correlation analysis showed that there existed a significant correlation between the characters except for lateral root number, root diameter and length. The correlation coefficient between the fresh weight of root and the reed head diameter was up to 0.877. Principal component analysis showed that the average of overall yield per plant and root diameter could be used as the comprehensive reference index for germplasm evaluation. The differences and correlations in phenotypic traits of different S. baicalensis strains, provide theoretical basis for distinguishing germplasm and breeding good varieties of S. baicalensis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xia", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Min", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yong-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yan-Li", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Scutellaria baicalensis extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28861964", "10.4268/cjcmm20160209"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
