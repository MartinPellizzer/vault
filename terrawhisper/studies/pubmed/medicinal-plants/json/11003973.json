The diagnosis was confirmed by polysomnographic standard examinations. The patients were treated with 2 tablets in the evening. Each tablet contains 250 mg valerian extract and 60 mg hop extract. A polysomnographic re-examination after 2 weeks of treatment revealed declines in the sleep latency and the wake time. As a consequence the sleep efficiency increased. Sleep stage 1 (S1) was reduced and the slow wave sleep increased. In addition, the patients judged their being refreshed in the morning by assigning a rating of 1 to 6. They reported an improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. No adverse events were observed. Based on these findings a pivotal study can be designed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zeller AG, Seeblickstr. 4, CH-8590 Romanshorn, Switzerland. axel. brattstroem@zellerag.ch"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "F\u00fcssel", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brattstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9517857", "ISSNLinking": "0949-2321"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hova"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polysomnography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11003973"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
