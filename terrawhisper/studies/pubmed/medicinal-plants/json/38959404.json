RNA interaction with MYR metabolites <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> has been investigated in order to gain a better understanding of MYR toxicities. We detected two guanosine adducts (GA1 and GA2), two adenosine adducts (AA1 and AA2), and two cytosine adducts (CA1 and CA2) by LC-MS/MS analysis of total RNA extracts from cultured primary mouse hepatocytes and liver tissues of mice after exposure to MYR. An order of nucleoside adductions was found to be GAs > AAs > CAs, and the result of density functional theory calculations was in agreement with that detected by the LC-MS/MS-based approach. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have shown that MYR was oxidized by cytochrome P450 enzymes to 1'-hydroxyl and 3'-hydroxyl metabolites, which were then sulfated by sulfotransferases (SULTs) to form sulfate esters. The resulting sulfates would react with the nucleosides by S<sub>N</sub>1 and/or S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, resulting in RNA adduction. The modification may alter the biochemical properties of RNA and disrupt RNA functions, perhaps partially contributing to the toxicities of MYR."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
