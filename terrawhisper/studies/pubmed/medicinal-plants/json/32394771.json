The Ayurvedic drugs are derived primarily from various parts of the plants, like root, leaf, flower, fruit or plant as a whole. Plants uptake minerals and other nutrients from the soil through their root system. Along with other minerals radionuclides present in the growing media also reach to the plant parts following the same pathway. Realizing the probable health hazards via the intake of Ayurvedic drugs, it is important to assess the concentration of natural radionuclides in commonly used medicinal plants.<b>Materials and methods:</b> NaI(Tl) scintillator-based gamma-ray spectrometry has been used to determine the activity concentrations of primordial radionuclides (<sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K) in the most commonly used medicinal plant parts as ingredients of Ayurvedic medicines in India.<b>Results and discussion:</b> The average specific activity (Bqkg<sup>-1</sup>) of <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K was found to be 43\u2009\u00b1\u200918, 36\u2009\u00b1\u200915[Formula: see text] and 230\u2009\u00b1\u200946, respectively. The estimated annual committed effective doses due to the intake of common Ayurvedic medicines at prescribed dosage was found to be 39\u2009\u00b1\u200916 <i>\u00b5</i>Sv y<sup>-1</sup>,[Formula: see text] which is quite low as compared with the radiation dose limit of 1 mSvy<sup>-1</sup> from all natural sources, reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP-60).<b>Conclusions:</b> It is found categorically that intake of Ayurvedic medicines at normal dosage poses no radiological hazard to the individual. Present results are significant in the wake of myths that many hazardous materials including radioisotopes are present at higher levels. Obtained results also serve as a reference information for the distribution of radionuclides in medicinal plant species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Research in Physical Sciences, Department of Physics, Fatima Mata National College (Autonomous), Kollam, India."}], "LastName": "Monica", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Research in Physical Sciences, Department of Physics, Fatima Mata National College (Autonomous), Kollam, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics, The Papua New Guinea University of Technology, Lae, Morobe, Papua New Guinea."}], "LastName": "Jojo", "ForeName": "Panakal John", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Biomedical Physics, School of Healthcare and Medical Sciences, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Khandaker", "ForeName": "Mayeen Uddin", "Initials": "MU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Radiat Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8809243", "ISSNLinking": "0955-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioisotopes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Radioisotopes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32394771", "10.1080/09553002.2020.1767816"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
