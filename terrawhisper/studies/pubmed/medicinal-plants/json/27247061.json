A survey was conducted to document medicinal plants used to control parasites in goats in Kwezi and Ntambethemba villages in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Information from 50 farmers and 3 herbalists was obtained through the use of a structured questionnaire, and a snowball sampling technique was used to identify key informants. The obtained data were analysed using PROC FREQ of SAS (2003), and fidelity level values were determined to estimate the healing potential of the mentioned plants. The survey revealed nine plant species belonging to eight families that were used to control parasites in goats. Asphodelaceae (22.22%) was the most frequently used plant family. Leaves were the most used plant parts, constituting 60.38%. They were prepared either as infusions or decoctions of single plants or in mixtures. Aloe ferox, Acokanthera oppositifolia and Elephantorrhiza elephantina were the plants having the highest fidelity level for their use to control parasites, each scoring 100%, followed by Albuca setosa (83.33%). The study revealed low knowledge about ethnoveterinary medicine in the study area. It also revealed that information on ethno-veterinary medicine in this area is mostly confined to older people and there is danger that this knowledge can be lost before being passed on to other generations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to document information on these plant species so that the future generation can benefit. Further investigation should be carried out to validate the efficacy and safety of the above-mentioned plants so as to provide cheap alternative ways of controlling parasites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sanhokwe", "ForeName": "Marcia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Livestock and Pasture Science, University of Fort Hare Alice. jmupangwa@ufh.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Mupangwa", "ForeName": "Johnfisher", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Masika", "ForeName": "Patrick J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maphosa", "ForeName": "Viola", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Muchenje", "ForeName": "Voster", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "Onderstepoort J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0401107", "ISSNLinking": "0030-2465"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Goat Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Goats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Diseases, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no financial or personal relationships which may have inappropriately influenced them in writing this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Acocks J.P.H, 1975, \u2018Veld types of South Africa\u2019, Memoirs of the Botanical Survey of South Africa 40, 1\u2013128."}, {"Citation": "Alexiades M.N, 1996, \u2018Collecting ethnobotanical data: An introduction to basic concepts and techniques\u2019, in Alexiades M.N.
