In the present study, the contribution of sugar hydrolysis and lipid peroxidation to Amadori and Maillard reactions, and to seed deterioration was investigated in mung-bean (Vigna radiata Wilczek). The contents of glucose and lipid peroxidation products in seed axes increased significantly during storage. The accumulation of Amadori products in seed axes was correlated to the lipid peroxidation, whereas the accumulation of Maillard products was closely correlated to sugar hydrolysis. The rate of accumulation of Maillard products was not well correlated to the content of Amadori products in both seed axes and protein/glucose model system, reflecting the complex nature of Amadori and Maillard reactions. The content of Amadori products in seed axes increased during the early stages of seed ageing, whereas the content of Maillard products increased steadily during the entire period of storage. The accumulation of Maillard products in seed axes was associated with the decline of seed vigour. These data suggest that, during seed ageing, sugar hydrolysis and lipid peroxidation are coupled with non-enzymatic protein modification through Amadori and Maillard reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "U M", "Initials": "UM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "W Q", "Initials": "WQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10937697", "10.1093/jexbot/51.348.1221"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
