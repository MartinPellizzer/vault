The morphology, drug-loading and release in vitro of SM-BSA-MS was studied.", "The diameters of SM-BSA-MS were in the range of 1-3 m. The drug loading of microspheres, formulated with different drug/albumin ratios as 1, 2, 1:1, 2:1, were 31.6%, 47.7% and 67.9% , respectively. And the drug entrapment efficiencies of different drug/albumin ratios were higher than 94%. The results of in vitro release experiments showed that the drug loaded microspheres have the properties of sustained-release compared with the Sinomenine hydrochloride injection. Different release characteristics could be obtained by adjusting the prescription composition and the thermal denaturation condition.", "Spray drying technique is a simple and feasible method for preparing SM-BSA-MS.
