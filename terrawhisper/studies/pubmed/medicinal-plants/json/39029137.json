It is formed by further oxidization of theaflavins and thearubigins, in combination with proteins, polysaccharides, and caffeine etc. TB is a characteristic ingredient and bioactive substance of Pu-erh tea. However, the effects of TB on ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear.", "This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of TB on UC in terms of recovery of intestinal homeostasis and regulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 2&4 signaling pathway.", "The colitis models were established by administering 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to C57BL/6 mice for 5 days to evaluate the therapeutic and preventive effects of TB on UC. Mesalazine was used as a positive control. H&E staining, complete blood count, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and 16S rRNA sequencing were employed to assess histological changes, blood cells analysis, content of cytokines, expression and distribution of mucin (MUC)2 and TLR2&4, differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in lamina propria, and changes in intestinal microbiota, respectively. Western blot was utilized to study the relative expression of tight junction proteins and the key proteins in TLR2&4-mediated MyD88-dependent MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and AKT signaling pathways.", "TB outstanding alleviated colitis, inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced white blood cells while increasing red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. TB increased the expression of occludin, claudin-1 and MUC2, effectively restored intestinal barrier function. TB also suppressed differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells in the colon's lamina propria, increased the fraction of Treg cells, and promoted the balance of Treg/Th17 to tilt towards Tregs. Moreover, TB increased the Firmicutes to Bacteroides (F/B) ratio, as well as the abundance of Akkermansia, Muribaculaceae, and Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group at the genus level. In addition, TB inhibited the activation of TLR2&4-mediated MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and AKT signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells of DSS-induced mice.", "TB acts in restoring intestinal homeostasis and anti-inflammatory in DSS-induced UC, and exhibiting a preventive effect after long-term use.
