Proximate analyses showed that the composition of winged bean was similar to soyabean, while the composition of the other legumes differed considerably. This was also the case for antinutritional constituents and minerals. As to the amino acid composition, the lysine level was high with the highest value in winged bean (7.5 g/16 g N). However, the concentration of methionine and cystine was low which limits their protein quality. Another important amino acid, threonine, was generally high, especially in winged bean (4.3 g/16 g N). With exception of field bean, true protein digestibility was above 80%, soyabean having the highest value (90.7%). The biological value was also highest in soyabean (76.1%) followed by winged bean (69.9%). Utilizable protein was high in soyabean (28.8%) and somewhat lower in winged bean (23.4%). Energy digestibility was around 80%, soyabean having the highest value of 85.8%. The study findings support the idea that winged bean is a good alternative plant protein source in Tanzania."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science and Production, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Chuo Kikuu, Morogoro, Tanzania."}], "LastName": "Mnembuka", "ForeName": "B V", "Initials": "BV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eggum", "ForeName": "B O", "Initials": "BO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2ZD004190S", "NameOfSubstance": "Threonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "48TCX9A1VT", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cystine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Threonine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1988;38(2):155-62", "ArticleIdList": ["3200801"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1987;37(3):261-4", "ArticleIdList": ["3507683"]}, {"Citation": "Analyst. 1967 Feb;92(91):107-11", "ArticleIdList": ["6040699"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8577651", "10.1007/BF01088271"]}}]}
