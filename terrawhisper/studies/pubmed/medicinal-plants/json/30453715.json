The endophytes of medicinal plants have the ability to produce the same active substances as the host, so this report focused on the endophytic Bacillus subtilis, to study the origin of ligustrazine in Chuanxiong Rhizoma preliminarily by inoculating the isolated endophytic B. subtilis to the Chuanxiong Rhizoma medium <i>in vitro</i> for solid state fermentation. Tissue grinding method was used to isolate the endogenetic B. subtilis. The morphological features, conventional physiological and biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA molecular techniques were combined to identify the endogenetic strains. Then, the strains that grew well in the medicinal matrix of Chuanxiong Rhizoma were screened out for further fermentation studies. The solid-state fermentation was performed at 37 \u00b0C for 30 d using Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium (40 g Chuanxiong Rhizoma powder, 100 mL sterile water, 121 \u00b0C, sterilization for 25 minutes). UPLC was used to detect the contents of ligustrazine, acetoin in the Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium and Chuanxiong Rhizoma. All the five strains were Gram-positive and had spores. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence showed that the endophytes were B. subtilis. The results of UPLC showed that ligustrazine was detected in the Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium inoculated with endogenetic B. subtilis LB3, LB3-2-1, LB4, LB5 and LB6-2, while not detected neither in blank Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium nor in Chuanxiong Rhizoma. This study showed that the endogenetic B. subtilis of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. can make use of Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium to produce ligustrazine. Endogenetic B. subtilis has a certain correlation with the accumulation of ligustrazine in Rhizoma Chuanxiong. We speculate that the ligustrazine may be derived from the catabolism of endogenetic B. subtilis in Ligusticum chuanxiong."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Dan-Dan", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-Lai", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hao-Kun", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V80F4IA5XG", "NameOfSubstance": "tetramethylpyrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ligusticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30453715", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180703.007"]}}]}
