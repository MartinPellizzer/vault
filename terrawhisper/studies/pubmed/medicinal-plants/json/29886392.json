A total of 525 water, soil, and wheat samples, as well as 420 hair samples were assessed using atomic absorption spectrometry (water, soil, wheat) and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (hair). The highest levels of Zn and Cu in water (4.9(4.2-5.1) and 1.0(0.9-1.1) mg/l), soil (23.8(20.7-27.0) and 2.6(1.9-3.1) mg/kg), and wheat (24.7(20.5-31.0) and 4.8(4.2-5.5) mg/kg) were observed in the eastern area (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Hair zinc levels in inhabitants of the western (184(165-198) \u00b5g/g) and eastern (224(211-253) \u00b5g/g) areas of the region exceeded the respective values from the central area by 32% and 61% (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). In turn, hair Cu levels in the central (16.4(14.3-17.8) \u00b5g/g) and eastern (17.9(16.4-19.0) \u00b5g/g) areas exceeded the values from the western area by 10% and 20%, respectively. Correlation analysis demonstrated that hair Zn levels were positively correlated with water and soil content, whereas wheat Zn levels were associated with soil and water content. For copper significant direct correlation was observed only between soil and water Cu content. In multiple regression models, only water zinc level was significantly associated with hair Zn content, although the general model accounted for 55% of variability of hair Zn content. Higher zinc and copper exposure in the eastern area is presumably associated with higher activity of metal-processing industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
