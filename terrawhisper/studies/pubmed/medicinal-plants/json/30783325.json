India with a rich heritage of such preparations needs evaluation as potent drugs. Explant culture system is a method, which is sensitive, reliable, reproducible and is capable of mimicking the <i>in situ</i> conditions maintaining the tissue in sufficiently high level of integration.", "The current study aimed to test the antioxidant activity of test compounds, namely, traditional aqueous (4212) and aqueous-methanolic (4308) extracts of <i>Rasna panchaka</i> using liver explant cultures.", "Dose-response optima of extracts (0.2-10 \u03bcg/mL) were determined using mouse liver explant culture system up to 48 h. The antioxidant property of extracts was assessed by primary oxidative defense parameters, namely, superoxide-dismutase (SOD), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA).", "The results indicated that the cellular architecture of the cultured tissue was well conserved in the first 6 h with a gradual display of specific changes in the next 24 h. There was a significant increase in MDA levels in experimental groups indicating the oxidative stress induction in explants. A dose of 2.0 \u03bcg/mL extracts have shown statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05) protection against oxidative stress. MDA levels, a measure of lipid peroxidation, were significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.01) reduced by 50% in extract treated explants compared to control. This effect was accompanied by the increase in the first defense enzymes SOD (50%) and catalase (18%) with no change in reduced GSH levels.", "The study enforces the importance of \"explant culture system,\" as it not only reduces the use of nonclinical/animal model but also is rapid and sensitive. Further, results of the current study also suggest that aqueous-methanolic extract of <i>Rasna panchaka</i> is having superior antioxidant activity compared to traditional water extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Drug Toxicology Research Centre, ICMR National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Talluri", "ForeName": "Manjula", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Drug Toxicology Research Centre, ICMR National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Yathapu", "ForeName": "Srinivasa Reddy", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Drug Toxicology Research Centre, ICMR National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Bharatraj", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902477", "ISSNLinking": "0253-7613"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Testing Alternatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Steinberg P.
