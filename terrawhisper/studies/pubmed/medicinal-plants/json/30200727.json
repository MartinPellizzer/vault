The major components and sweet substances are both known as mogrosides which are cucurbitane-type tetra-triterpenoids. Squalene epoxidase (SQE) has been generally recognized as the common rate-limiting enzyme in triterpenes and phytosterols, catalyzing into their common precursor 2,3-oxidosqualene (OS); however, in the biosynthesis of mogrosides, the precursor was 2,3,22,23-dioxidosqualene (DOS) instead of OS. To explore the specific SQE in S. grosvenorii, we cloned two full-length SQEs (SgSQE1, SgSQE2), performed bioinformatic analysis, analyzed the expression patterns in different periods of fruits by Real-time PCR, and induced the prokaryotic expressions. Finally, the interactive sites between SQE and substrate were predicted by docking, which would provide evidence for SQE gene function study of mogrosides and also lay foundation for triterpene biosynthesis in other plants. SgSQE1 and SgSQE2 both encoded predicted proteins of 524 amino acids, and shared 84% identity to each other at residues level, but had high specificity at N-terminal region. They both accumulated in fruits, but with different patterns, SgSQE1 increased rapidly and reached the highest level at 15 d, which had identical co-expression pattern with cucurbitadienol synthase (CS). SgSQE2 had a relatively constant level. The docking results showed that predicted proteins of SgSQE1 and SgSQE2 can interact with OS, with different contact sites (R348 for SgSQE1, H349 for SgSQE2). The recombinant proteins had no activities by prokaryotic expression, which were caused by transmembrane regions. However, all the results strongly suggested that SgSQEs were both involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis in S. grosvenorii. SgSQE1 might be involved in mogrosides biosynthesis and SgSQE2 might participate in other cucurbitane-type triterpenes or phytosterols biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Flow Station of Post-Doctoral Scientific Research, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breeding Base of State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breeding Base of State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Co-Innovation Center for Utilization of Botanical Functional Ingredients, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breeding Base of State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breeding Base of State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytosterols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Squalene Monooxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytosterols"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Squalene Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30200727", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180528.006"]}}]}
