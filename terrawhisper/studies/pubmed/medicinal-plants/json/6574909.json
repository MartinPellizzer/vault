Effects of the red light on the mRNA levels of two subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) (ribulose-P2 carboxylase), rate of enzyme synthesis and accumulation of the enzyme were examined for the plants. Increases of the two mRNA levels, encoded in nuclei and chloroplasts were observed. Red light followed by far-red light treatment for 5 min inhibited the increases. An increase parallel with the mRNA levels was found for the rate of the enzyme synthesis and accumulation of the enzyme. These results indicate that the induction of two mRNA levels is mediated by phytochrome and causes the red-light-inducible, far-red-light-reversible increase of ribulose-P2 carboxylase. When white light was irradiated to induce the enzyme, the effects of red light given in darkness were reinforced. These results indicate that light-induction of ribulose-P2 carboxylase is mediated by phytochrome and controlled by the two mRNA levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakihama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamikubo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shinozaki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11121-56-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochrome"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxy-Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxy-Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Code"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6574909", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1983.tb07507.x"]}}]}
