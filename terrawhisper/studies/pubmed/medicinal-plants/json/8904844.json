Nanking cDNA library resulted in the identification and cloning of a second (+)-delta-cadinene synthase. A probe for the screens was prepared by PCR using primers based on conserved sequences in farnesyl diphosphate cyclases and genomic DNA as a template. This second cDNA clone encodes a protein that is 80% identical to the recently described (+)-delta-cadinene synthases CAD1-C1 and C14 from G. arboreum and maintains a significant degree of homology to the other known mono-, sesqui-, and diterpene synthases. As in the case of CAD1-C1 (+)-delta-cadinene synthase from cultured cotton cells, the synthesis of the second CAD1-A mRNA was induced by treatment of cotton cell suspension cultures with a partially purified elicitor preparation from the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae. Expression of CAD1-A mRNA was quantitated with reverse transcription PCR and showed that CAD1-A mRNA was maximally increased 8-fold, 6 h after addition of elicitor. Heterologous expression of this second cDNA produced a 64 kD protein that catalyzed the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to (+)-delta-cadinene, the identical product produced by CAD1-C1. The steady-state kinetic parameters of CAD1-A were similar to CAD1-C, showing a Km of 7 mM farnesyl diphosphate and kcat of 0.039 s-1 at 30 degrees C. However, the optimal pH and Mg2+ concentration for CAD1-A activity were significantly higher than those observed for CAD1-C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1333, USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Davisson", "ForeName": "V J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heinstein", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["U27535", "X96429"]}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 55118", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Isomerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "delta-cadinene synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Library"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Isomerases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8904844", "10.1021/np960344w", "np960344w"]}}]}
