Medicinal plants of Teucrium polium and Aloe vera have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may be profitable for diabetic patients. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of co-administration of ointments prepared from Teucrium polium hydroethanolic extract (TPEO) and Aloe vera gel (AVGO) on excisional wound healing in a diabetic mouse model. Following the induction of diabetes and circular excisional wound (7\u202fmm), the mice were divided into six groups, namely (\u2160) control mice treated with mupirocin (as a standard drug), (\u2161 and \u2162) the mice treated with 5 and 10 % TPEO, (\u2163 and \u2164) the mice treated with 5 and 10 % AVGO, and (\u2165) the mice treated with a combination of 5% TPEO and 5% AVGO (TPEO+AVGO). To investigate the wound area, we further evaluated the wound area ratio, histological analysis and the serum levels of tissue antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), immunohistochemistry staining for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), glucose transporter-1(GLUT-1) and collagen type 1 and mRNA expression levels for VEGF, IGF-1, GLUT-1 and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). The results showed that administration of the ointments, especially in combination form, shortened the inflammatory phase and reduced the levels of tissue MDA, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 compared to mupirocin group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Moreover, fibroblasts proliferation, collagen deposition, VEGF, IGF-1, GLUT-1-positive cells and level of TAC, and expressions of VEGF, IGF-1, GLUT-1 and FGF-2 were significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) increased in TPEO and AVGO, and especially in the mice treated with the mixed form. Therefore, topical co-administration of TPEO\u202f+\u202fAVGO accelerated open diabetic wound healing through shortening the inflammatory phase and increasing cell proliferation and collagen deposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
