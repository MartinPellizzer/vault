We approach this question here through the study of mahouts' knowledge regarding the responses by elephants to their health problems, and the human medicinal uses of plants and the care of domestic animals that result from their observations.", "32 mahouts were interviewed in Thongmyxay district and 28\u202fat the Elephant Conservation Center in the province of Xayabury. Interviews focused on the elephants' diet, health problems, plant items they consume in particular physiological or pathological contexts and the treatments that mahouts provide them. For each plant mentioned, the part of the plant consumed and mode of preparation and administration if used by mahouts were recorded. Species samples were then collected and later identified by specialists.", "114 species were recorded as being consumed by elephants during interviews with mahouts and forest outings with them to collect samples. Twenty species were identified as used by elephants in particular pathological conditions or physiological states. According to interviewed mahouts, the consumption of certain plants improves the health of the elephant. We observed clear convergences between the observations interpreted by the mahouts as self-medication behaviour from elephants and their own medicinal practices (for human and veterinary purposes).", "Beyond a mere reproduction of elephant self-medication behaviours observed, the human or veterinary medicinal cares derived from these observations are the result of complex arrangements integrating all available medicinal and conceptual resources into elaborate preparations. We recommend that mahouts' knowledge about traditional medicinal care given to elephants be further compiled, as it could have a beneficial impact on veterinary health care provided in elephant resorts and elephants' well-being."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
