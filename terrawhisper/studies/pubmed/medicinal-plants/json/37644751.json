Individuals suffering from diabetes are still more susceptible to many long-term and short-term side effects, which most often cause fatalities. Even though chemically synthesized anti-diabetic entities are capable of helping manage and treat, there has been significant risks related with their prolong and repetitive use. Hence, there is a requirement for safer and novel approaches that might be formed and utilized.", "Aim of the present review is to explain the naturally occurring phytochemicals and novel approach as anti-diabetic agents in the treatment of diabetes and its related issues.", "A survey of Google scholar, Research Gate, Pubmed, Science Direct, NCBI database was carried out conducted to determine a most hopeful phytochemicals and novel drug delivery systems in the management of diabetes.", "The study stressed the significance of phytomolecules and some novel approaches researched or reported in the literature for the management and cure of diabetes. It is suggested that changes in lifestyle can help patients and like nutritional support, assessment and lifestyle guidance must be individualized based on physical and functional capacity. Further evaluations and improved preventative medicine were the result of improving patient outcomes.", "Conventional or synthetic drugs provide relief for short time but nanoformulations of phytomolecules offer an improved therapeutic with fewer negative side effects. Herbal medicines are rich in phytoconstituents and possess variety of health benefits. This review is compilation of phytoconstituents and novel drug delivery system of phytomolecules i.e. nanoparticles, niosomes, microsphere, microparticle and others."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1556-3872"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PSIT - Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology (Pharmacy) Bhauti, Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 209305, India."}], "LastName": "Nooreen", "ForeName": "Zulfa", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PSIT - Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology (Pharmacy) Bhauti, Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 209305, India."}], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Awani Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Integral Informatic and Research Center-1 (IIRC-1) Intergral University Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Summayya", "ForeName": "Fariha", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 223021, India."}], "LastName": "Tandon", "ForeName": "Sudeep", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Diabetes Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101253260", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3998"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37644751", "10.2174/1573399820666230829094724", "CDR-EPUB-134114"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
