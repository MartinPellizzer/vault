We investigated whether patients with HIV infection had unrealistic hopes in non-conventional treatment (non-CT), to what extent they use non-CT, and whether perceived benefit and harm differ between the two modes of treatment. We examined a sample of 100 patients with documented HIV-infection in the out-patient department using a self-developed questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and data concerning the HIV status. Fifty-six patients used AT and/or PT. Severity of HIV disease did not differ between users and non-users of non-CT. The most important reasons for the use of AT were 'strengthening the body and resistance; supplementing conventional therapy'. Users of non-CT rated the competence of CT lower than non-users in solving medical problems (VAS-scores 0-100: 65.5 +/- 17.6 vs 76.3 +/- 17.7; p = 0.003) and in solving emotional problems (VAS scores 0-100: 35.8 +/- 21.2 vs 48.2 +/- 28.9; p = 0.02). Users of non-CT were significantly more anxious 8.4 +/- 4.8 vs 5.5 +/- 4.6; p = 0.004) and more depressive (5.7 +/- 4.5 vs 3.7 +/- 4.5; p = 0.03) than non-users. Expectations and hopes did not differ between users of AT and non-users: main hopes were a delay of disease progression (76% vs 71%) and an alleviation of symptoms (78% vs 66%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Langewitz", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "R\u00fcttimann", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Laifer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maurer", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiss", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Psychosom Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376333", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3999"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Homeopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Massage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Relaxation Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7877123", "10.1016/0022-3999(94)90021-3"]}}]}
