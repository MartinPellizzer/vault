(DBL) is a common herbal medicine where furanoterpenoid diosbulbin B (DSB) is a major component responsible for its hepatotoxicity. The metabolic oxidation of the furan moiety of DSB, resulting in covalent binding to hepatic protein, is considered to initiate its liver injury.", "We aimed to develop a mechanism-based plasma protein adduction-based biomarker to determine DBL exposure and to predict the onset of hepatotoxicity induced by DBL.", "Rats were intragastrically treated with DBL extract, and the plasma samples were collected. Plasma ALT and AST were measured with commercial kits. Plasma protein modification was determined by immunoblot assay. Assessment of DSB-induced protein adduction was achieved by LC-MS/MS analysis of complete proteolytic digestion of adducted protein to pyrroline derivative A4 using pronase enzyme. The structure of the resulting pyrroline derivatives was confirmed by NMR.", "Plasma protein of rats treated with DBL extract was covalently modified by the metabolite of DSB. Pyrroline derivative A4 was detected in proteolytic digestion of plasma obtained from rats administered DBL extract. The protein adduction elevated with the increase in the dosage of DBL extract. A detectable level of plasma was observed 10 days after withdrawal of DBL extract post 30-day continuous administration. In addition, the elevation trend of plasma ALT was found to be proportional to the accumulation trend of pyrroline derivative A4.", "DSB-derived plasma protein adduction correlated well with the exposure of DBL in rats. The protein adduction may be used as a good biomarker for diagnosis of DBL-induced liver injury and a useful indicator for DBL medication plans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
