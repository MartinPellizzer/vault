The growth of Staph. aureus was inhibited by dehydrated garlic at levels of 1.5% (w/v) and over. Enterotoxins A, B and C1 were only detectable in broth containing < 1% of garlic while enterotoxin D was produced at a level of 2%. Garlic also inhibited thermonuclease (TNAse) production, complete inhibition being observed at levels > or = 1.5%. TNAse was not always detected when enterotoxin was present."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Hygiene and Food Technology, Veterinary Faculty, University of Le\u00f3n, Spain."}], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Fandos", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sierra", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Otero", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "7503050", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8847"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enterotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.31.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Micrococcal Nuclease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Enterotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Micrococcal Nuclease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8002479", "10.1111/j.1365-2672.1994.tb04400.x"]}}]}
