In numerous plant species, seedling establishment is positively correlated with the initial seed size under drought stress conditions. In intra- and interspecies, plants with large seeds can withstand water deficiency stresses, whereas those with small seeds are efficient colonizers as a result of their ability to produce more seeds. Therefore, larger initial seeds confer more drought resistance on germinating seedlings. Although this phenomenon has been observed by evolutionary biologists and ecologists, the correlation of initial seed size with the drought resistance of seedlings/plants is not well-reviewed and characterized. Furthermore, the related molecular mechanisms are unknown. Understanding these mechanisms will benefit future breeding or design strategies to increase crop yields. In the present review, we focus on recent research to analyze the genetic factors of plants/crops involved in the regulation of seed size and drought tolerance and their corresponding signal transduction pathways. Several signaling pathways that determine plant drought tolerance through influencing the initial seed size are identified. Such pathways include those that are involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, and several transcription factors and sugar signaling pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Meng-Jiao", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3562-920X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology , Lanzhou University , Lanzhou , Gansu 730020 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8844-4356"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Lai-Sheng", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31904950", "10.1021/acs.jafc.9b06491"]}}]}
