As skin is the major organ, which is directly exposed to these permanent hair dyes, a comprehensive dermal safety assessment is needed. Hereto, we studied the photosensitization potential and mechanism involved in dermal phototoxicity of TAPS exposed to the dark and UVA/UVB/Sunlight by using different in-chemico and mammalian (HaCaT) cells, as test systems. Our experimental outcomes illustrate that TAPS get photodegraded (LC-MS/MS) and specifically generated superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) under UVA and UVB via type-I photodynamic reaction. The phototoxic potential of TAPS is measured through MTT, NRU, and LDH assays that depicted a significant cell viability reduction at 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml concentration and higher. Different cellular stainings (PI uptake, AO/EB, JC-1, NR uptake) suggested the role of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Further, the transcriptomics study revealed upregulation of Apaf-1, Bax, Cytochrome c, Caspase 3, Caspase 9 and downregulation of Catalase and Bcl-2 by TAPS treated cells that strengthen our findings. Thus, the above findings suggest that chronic application of TAPS may be hazardous for human skin and promote various skin diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
