Major compounds were isolated using low-pressure liquid chromatography. The quantitative analysis of phenolic acids was performed by a validated HPLC-UV method with limits of detection ranging from 0.04 to 0.57\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazine-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods were used for antioxidant activity evaluation. In addition, the minimal inhibitory concentration and the minimal bactericidal concentration against a panel of pathogenic bacteria and fungi were determined by the broth microdilution test.", "For the first time protocatechuic, caffeic, p-coumaroylquinic, caffeoylsinapoylquinic, caffeoylferuloylquinic, three feruloylquinic, six caffeoylquinic acids, and a caffeic acid hexoside were detected in Geigeria alata roots by LC-MS. HPLC-UV analyses showed that 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (25.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.08\u00a0mg/g dry weight (DW)) was the most abundant phenolic acid in roots, while 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (8.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.56\u00a0mg/g DW) was the main compound present in leaves. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid demonstrated stronger radical scavenging activity and reducing power compared with the crude extracts and the positive control 5-caffeoylquinic acid. 3,4,5-Tricaffeoylquinic acid revealed the highest antibacterial potential against the penicillin sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus.", "The caffeoylquinic acids content of up to 6.22% in Geigeria alata roots establishes this species as a new source rich in these bioactive molecules.
