Available evidence demonstrates that naringenin, as herbal medicine, has important pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-cancer activities. Collected data from in vitro and in vivo studies show the inactivation of carcinogens after treatment with pure naringenin, naringenin-loaded nanoparticles, and also naringenin in combination with anti-cancer agents in various malignancies, such as colon cancer, lung neoplasms, breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate tumors, oral squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, brain tumors, skin cancer, cervical and ovarian cancer, bladder neoplasms, gastric cancer, and osteosarcoma. Naringenin inhibits cancer progression through multiple mechanisms, like apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, angiogenesis hindrance, and modification of various signaling pathways including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, PI3K/Akt, NF-\u0138B, and TGF-\u03b2 pathways. In this review, we demonstrate that naringenin is a natural product with potential for the treatment of different types of cancer, whether it is used alone, in combination with other agents, or in the form of the naringenin-loaded nanocarrier, after proper technological encapsulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
