These drawbacks often lead to poor adherence and therapeutic failure. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the use of nutritional supplements as an adjuvant therapy for endometriosis. To facilitate clinical decision-making in managing women with endometriosis, a narrative review of clinical studies was conducted to investigate the effects of oral nutritional supplements on endometriosis-related pain. A literature search of the English-language PubMed/MEDLINE database was performed using appropriate keywords to identify clinical studies involving oral nutritional supplements and reporting on endometriosis-related pain. This narrative review included 20 studies published between 2013 and 2023, comprising 12 randomized controlled trials, six non-comparative trials, and two observational studies. The studies investigated the effects of various nutritional supplements on endometriosis-related pain, including vitamins, fatty acids, probiotics, medicinal plants, and bioactive compounds. A significant decrease in endometriosis-related pain was found in three out of five studies on vitamins, four out of six studies on fatty acids, one study on probiotics, two studies on medicinal plants, and five out of six studies on bioactive compounds. These nutritional supplements exhibited diverse biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects, all of which are relevant for managing endometriosis. These findings suggest that oral nutritional supplements could be included as part of a multidisciplinary treatment for endometriosis to decrease pain and enhance overall medical treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
