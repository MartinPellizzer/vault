In this study, some plants that are used for lowering cholesterol level in local areas of Pakistan, such as Artemisia absinthium L., Swertia chirayita and Sphaeranthus indicus were screened for their phytochemical and antibacterial properties. For this purpose, these plants were extracted in different solvents i.e. ethanol, hexane and ethyl acetate. Phytochemcial analysis unveiled the existence of different bioactive compounds in these extracts. Presence of sugars was further confirmed by performing TLC. Antibacterial activity was determined against indicated bacterial strains, among all extracts Gul-e-mundi had maximum inhibition zone (23mm). DPPH free radical assay revealed the significant antioxidative potential of all the extracts where Gul-e-mundi showed maximum potential i.e., 83%. Plant extracts were also showing anti-proliferative activity on root tips of Allium cepa and Gul-e-mundi was observed to have maximum antimitotic activity i.e. 5%. GC-MS analysis revealed that oleic acid and linoleic acid were the compounds responsible for imparting antibacterial potential to Gul-e-mundi. In conclusion, among all the tested extracts Gul-e-mundi had maximum antibacterial, antioxidative and antimitotic potential. For future studies, phytochemcials responsible for these activities can be isolated and modified for pharmacological purpose."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Quaid-e Azam Campus, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Dilshad", "ForeName": "Rimsha", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Quaid-e Azam Campus, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Batool", "ForeName": "Rida", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Quaid-e Azam Campus, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jamil", "ForeName": "Nazia", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia absinthium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Swertia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29618441"]}}]}
