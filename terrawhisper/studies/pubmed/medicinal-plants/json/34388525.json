Nutraceuticals, mainly based on natural products, have been proven to control the risk factors of CVDs effectively. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa is an underutilized fruit that is rich in phenolic compounds and has antioxidant activities. Scientific investigation was needed to verify the pharmacological properties of R. tomentosa fruit juice in Sprague-Dawley rats fed with high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) as antihypercholesterolemic and antiatherosclerotic agents. The experiments were carried out using male albino rats fed with HFHC diet for 75 days and at the same time orally supplemented with R. tomentosa fruit juice (RTFJ) in doses of 0.5, 1, and 2\u00a0g/kg body weight (BW) daily for 75 days. Simvastatin was used as a positive control. At the end of the experiment, the blood was collected, and the serum was assayed for total triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). The histopathology of coronary and aorta arteries was observed under the light microscope. The results demonstrated that the supplementation of RTFJ significantly prevented the increase of total triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and the decrease of high-density lipoprotein in serum. Supplementation of RTFJ also prevents atherosclerosis development by preventing the thickening of the blood vessel wall, deposition of lipid formation, and foam cells in the tunica intima of the aorta and coronary arteries. These findings suggested that supplementation of R. tomentosa fruit juice prevents hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
