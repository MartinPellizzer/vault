Quantitative and Qualitative analyses were carried out for all extracts. The 3 extracts were proved to be safe for human use. A single oral administration of the plant extracts (200\u00a0mg/kg) decreases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of normotensive rats after 1, 1.5, and 2\u00a0hr. Furthermore, groups treated with the evaluated extracts (100 & 200\u00a0mg/kg) or Captopril (20\u00a0mg/kg) showed a significant reduction in the elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Extract 3 showed the most antihypertensive activity. Serum biochemical parameters and lipid profile levels of treated groups were improved in comparison with induced-hypertensive untreated rats. In evaluation of oxidative damage parameters Glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in some organs, the investigated extracts or captopril restored the amount of reduced Glutathione in tissues in addition to an increase in the activity of the SOD after a significant depletion of SOD activity. In the clinical study, there was a significant dose dependent decrease in Systolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate compared with their basal values in both normotensive and hypertensive human volunteers after oral administration of Matricaria chamomilla beverages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7910-6841"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Awaad", "ForeName": "Amani A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Department, Desert Research Center, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Meligy", "ForeName": "Reham M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}], "LastName": "Zain", "ForeName": "Ghada M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdul Aziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Safhi", "ForeName": "Amal A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdul Aziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al Qurain", "ForeName": "Noura A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdul Aziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Almoqren", "ForeName": "Shekhah S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}], "LastName": "Zain", "ForeName": "Yara M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Department, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Sesh Adri", "ForeName": "Vidya D", "Initials": "VD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical pharmacy Department, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Saikhan", "ForeName": "Fahad I", "Initials": "FI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Matricaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29656575", "10.1002/ptr.6086"]}}]}
