Vaginal patches are one of the best drug delivery systems for the treatment of fungal infections in the vaginal environment, so a mucoadhesive film containing drugs such as clotrimazole and metronidazole is commercially available for patients. In the present study, a physicochemical comparison is made between clotrimazole loaded film and nanofiber fabricated with the new hybrid mucoadhesive formulation of dextran and alginate. Toxicity testing was performed using the MTT assay. Bioadhesion and antifungal effects were investigated for fibers and films. The release behavior of clotrimazole from two systems was evaluated by Franz cell in each case. The most important difference between nanofibrous and film mats were obtained in antifungal, mucoadhesive, Young's modulus and morphology. The nanofiber has a higher antifungal effect and two-fold adhesive to the mouse tissue, than film. The inherent flexibility of nanofiber obviated the need for a plasticizer, which may have cytotoxic side effects. The Clotrimazole loaded nanofibrous of Alginate/Dextran mats were successfully electrospun. They exhibited more bioadhesive with higher and faster antifungal properties versus similar formulation film. Further in vivo investigation is required for their application in vaginal candidiasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
