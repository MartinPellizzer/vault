New data have increased the interest in garlic and its role in normalization and treatment of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Recent studies have shown the complex composition of garlic, containing many compounds, that present potential positive effect in the field of health. The aim of the present paper was to review results of some studies that have found a relationship between garlic and cardiovascular diseases. From some of them it can be summarized that garlic can normalize plasma lipid, check lipid peroxidation, stimulate fibrinolytic activity, inhibit platelet aggregation, smooth the thickening and structural changes of artery wall related to aging and atherosclerosis, and decrease blood pressure. However, some other studies do not support these benefits. The positive effects found have promoted many study projects, nevertheless, the extract lability and the lack of result consensus call for a moderate consumption of garlic and garlic extracts. The composition variation due to gathering and aging together with the changes occurring in canning and industrial treatment makes necessary the application of some norms in the production and consumption of this functional food in order to guarantee its use in adequate form and doses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Nutrici\u00f3n y Bromatolog\u00eda I (Nutrici\u00f3n), Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid-Espa\u00f1a."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Muniz", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Revisi\u00f3n: efectos cardiovasculares del ajo (Allium sativum)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Resistance"}], "NumberOfReferences": "88"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11347290"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
