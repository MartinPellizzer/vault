Class discussions are conducted on the usefulness of remedies, the attitudes of practitioners toward traditional remedy use and the risks of relying on herbal preparations. Each student prepares a 15-minute presentation on a disease state, which covers modern pharmaceuticals and herbal or folk remedy alternatives used in that disease. Special emphasis is given to drug-herb interactions. <b>Results.</b> The class has gained popularity among students and consistently fills within the first hour of computerized registration. Students agree that being educated in the benefits and potential toxicities of herbal products will better prepare them to counsel their patients who use these remedies. The elective has been offered 10 times since 2007. Anecdotal comments from our alumni indicate that they have found the information to be very useful in their practice environments. <b>Conclusion.</b> Providing our students with a greater understanding of herbal remedies is essential to prepare them for practice. By including both the uses and potential toxicities, the student pharmacist is able to counsel her patients from a standpoint of expertise on these self-administered remedies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Charleston School of Pharmacy, Charleston, West Virginia."}], "LastName": "Linger", "ForeName": "Rebecca S", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Pharm Educ", "NlmUniqueID": "0372650", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9459"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Appalachian Region"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Curriculum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Education, Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Educational Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["education", "methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Wu CH, Wang CC, Tsai MT, Huang WT, Kennedy J.
