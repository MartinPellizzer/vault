Moreover, in cultivars Comprimo RS and Threefoldwhite the vitamin C was determined as depending on seed maturity within 25-40% of dry matter at 5% intervals. The compared broad bean cultivars, frozen or canned at the level of 30% d.w. in seeds differed by the vitamin C content. The extreme differences reached 21% for the raw material, 32% for frozen seeds cooked, and 15% for canned appertized seeds. However, the ranking of cultivars in the final products differed from that in the raw material. The vitamin C content decreased with increasing degrees of seed ripeness in the range from 25-40%. This particularly concerns fresh seeds of Threefoldwhite cv. In the final products differences were smaller and reached 2-6% in cooked frozen seeds and 18-24% in appertized canned seeds. Blanching decreased the vitamin C content by 14-43%. Freezing of blanched seeds and the 6-month storage of frozen goods decreased this content by about 24-56%. Frozen whole seeds contained 9.3-13.8 mg of vitamin C in 100 g after cooking (compared with fresh seeds, the losses reached 56-73%) and appertized canned seeds 8.2-11.7 mg in 100 g (compared with fresh seeds, the losses reached 63-73%). The average difference in favour of cooked frozen seeds reached 17%. The difference in vitamin C content between whole seeds and cotyledones varied within 1-9%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Katedry Surowc\u00f3w i Przetw\u00f3rstwa Owocowo-Warzywnego, Akademii Rolniczej w Krakowie."}], "LastName": "Kmiecik", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lisiewska", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jaworska", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Zawarto\u015b\u0107 witaminy C w surowcu oraz w mrozonkach i konserwach apertyzowanych z bobu w zalezno\u015bci od odmiany i stopnia dojrza\u0142o\u015bci nasion."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig", "NlmUniqueID": "0414756", "ISSNLinking": "0035-7715"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Frozen Foods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2244168"]}}]}
