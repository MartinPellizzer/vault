Immunomodulators play pivotal roles in supporting immune function either suppressing or stimulating the immune system's response to invading pathogens. Among different immunomodulators, plant-based secondary metabolites have emerged as high potential not only for immune defense but also for cellular immunoresponsiveness. These natural immunomodulators can be developed into safer alternatives to the clinically used immunosuppressants and immunostimulant cytotoxic drugs which possess serious side effects. Many plants of different species have been reported to possess strong immunomodulating properties. The immunomodulatory effects of plant extracts and their bioactive metabolites have been suggested due to their diverse mechanisms of modulation of the complex immune system and their multifarious molecular targets. Phytochemicals such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, carbohydrates and polyphenols have been reported as responsible for the immunomodulatory effects of several medicinal plants. This review illustrates the potent immunomodulatory effects of 65 plant secondary metabolites, including dietary compounds and their underlying mechanisms of action on cellular and humoral immune functions in in vitro and in vivo studies. The clinical potential of some of the compounds to be used for various immune-related disorders is highlighted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1457-0245"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Ali Reza", "ForeName": "A S M", "Initials": "ASM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Nasrin", "ForeName": "Mst Samima", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Hossen", "ForeName": "Md Amjad", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Md Atiar", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems Biology (INBIOSIS), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Jantan", "ForeName": "Ibrahim", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2935-6345"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Md Areeful", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Central de Chile, Santiago, Chile."}], "LastName": "Sobarzo-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Eduardo", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "29"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34955042", "10.1080/10408398.2021.2021138"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
