The complex structures and diverse bioactivities of meroterpenoids have attracted more attention for chemists and pharmacologists. Since the first review summarized by Geris in 2009, there are absent of systematic reviews reported about meroterpenoids from the higher and lower fungi up to now. In the past decades, myriads of meroterpenoids were discovered, and it is necessary to summarize these meroterpenoids about their unique structures and promising bioactivities. In this review, we use a new classification method based on the non-terpene precursors, and also highlight the structural features, bioactivity of natural meroterpenoids from the higher and lower fungi covering the period of September 2008 to February 2020. A total of 709 compounds were discussed and cited the 182 references. Meanwhile, we also primarily summarize their occurrence, structural diversity, biological activities, and molecular targets."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
