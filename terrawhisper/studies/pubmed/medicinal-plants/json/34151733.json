It is having devastating effects on the people of all countries. In this regard, the phytochemicals of medicinal plants could be explored to prevent this disease. <i>M. oleifera</i> is a miracle plant with antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties because of its high content of flavonoids, glucosides and glucosinolates. Therefore, we constructed a library of 294 phytochemicals of <i>M. oleifera</i> and filtered it through the FAF-Drugs4. Further, molecular docking studies of filtered phytochemicals were performed with Mpro enzyme to investigate the binding interactions. Drug likeness properties, ADMET prediction were analyzed to determine the therapeutic aspect of these compounds. Based on the binding energy score of the top 4 compounds, the results indicate that Vicenin-2 has the highest binding affinity (-8.6\u2009kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) as compared to the reference molecule (-8.4\u2009kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). ADMET result reveals that all top four compounds have minimal toxic effects and good absorption. Further, 500\u2009ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four compounds showed that Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin have good stability with Mpro. These two compounds were then subjected for MMPBSA (last 50\u2009ns) calculation to analyze the protein-ligand stability and dynamic behavior. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin showed very good binding free energy i.e. -40.136\u2009kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and -26.784\u2009kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Promising outcomes from MD simulations evidence the worth of these compounds for future drug development to combat coronavirus disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
