The wide presence of this kind of components in various foods and beverages has been unambiguously determined, but their occurrence in various phytomedicines remains in obscurity. In this study, we established and evaluated an HPLC-UV method and used it to measure the contents of four \u03b1-DCs including 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), glyoxal (GO), methylglyoxal (MGO), and diacetyl (DA) in 35 Chinese herbs after they have been derivatized with 4-nitro-1,2-phenylenediamine. The results uncover that 3-DG is the major component among the \u03b1-DCs, being detectable in all the selected herbs in concentrations ranging from 22.80\u00a0\u03bcg/g in the seeds of Alpinia katsumadai to 7032.75\u00a0\u03bcg/g in the fruit of Siraitia grosuenorii. The contents of the other three compounds are much lower than those of 3-DG, with GO being up to 22.65\u00a0\u03bcg/g, MGO being up to 55.50\u00a0\u03bcg/g, and DA to 18.75\u00a0\u03bcg/g, respectively. The data show as well the contents of the total four \u03b1-DCs in the herbs are generally in a comparable level to those in various foods, implying that herb medicines may have potential risks on human heath in view of the \u03b1-DCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
