The compound's <i>in silico</i> (ADMET) analysis was also conducted. Subsequently, the compound ((E)-<i>N</i>-(4-(1-(2-(4-(4-Chlorobenzamido)benzoyl)hydrazono)ethyl) phenyl)nicotinamide) was successfully synthesized and designated as compound <b>X</b>. <i>In vitro</i>, VEGFR-2 inhibition and cytotoxicity of compound <b>X</b> against HCT-116 and A549 cancer cell lines and normal Vero cell lines were conducted. Apoptosis induction and migration assay of HCT-116 cell lines after treatment with compound <b>X</b> were also evaluated.", "DFT calculations assigned stability and reactivity of compound <b>X</b>. Molecular docking and MD simulations indicated its excellent binding against VEGFR-2. Furthermore, MM-GBSA analysis, PLIP experiments, and PCAT studies confirmed compound <b>X</b>'s correct binding with optimal dynamics and energy. ADMET analysis expressed its general likeness and safety. The <i>in vitro</i> assays demonstrated that compound <b>X</b> effectively inhibited VEGFR-2, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.319 \u00b1 0.013 \u03bcM and displayed cytotoxicity against HCT-116 and A549 cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 57.93 and 78.82 \u03bcM, respectively. Importantly, compound <b>X</b> exhibited minimal toxicity towards the non-cancerous Vero cell lines, (IC<sub>50</sub> = 164.12 \u03bcM). Additionally, compound <b>X</b> significantly induced apoptosis of HCT-116 cell lines and inhibited their potential to migrate and heal.", "In summary, the presented study has identified compound <b>X</b> as a promising candidate for the development of a novel apoptotic lead anticancer drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo 11884, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Eissa", "ForeName": "Ibrahim H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh 13713, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elkaeed", "ForeName": "Eslam B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo 11884, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elkady", "ForeName": "Hazem", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo 11884, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Reda G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, P.O.
