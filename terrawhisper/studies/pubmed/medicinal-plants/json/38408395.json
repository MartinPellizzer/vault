The low (LL: 440\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and high (HL: 1135\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) intensity of white light with or without FR (LLFR: 545\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> including 115\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; HLFR: 1254\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0140\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) was applied on the tomato cultivar (Solanum Lycopersicon cv. Moneymaker) and mutants of phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB1, and phyB2). Both light intensity and FR affected plant morphological traits, leaf biomass, and flowering time. Irrespective of genotype, flowering was delayed by LLFR and accelerated by HLFR compared to the corresponding light intensity without FR. In LLFR, a reduced energy flux through the electron transfer chain along with a reduced energy dissipation per reaction center improved the maximum quantum yield of PSII, irrespective of genotype. HLFR increased net photosynthesis and gas exchange properties in a genotype-dependent manner. FR-dependent regulation of hormones was affected by light signaling. It appeared that PHYB affected the levels of abscisic acid and salicylic acid while PHYA took part in the regulation of CK in FR-exposed plants. Overall, light intensity and signaling of FR influenced plants' photosynthesis and growth by altering electron transport, gas exchange, and changes in the level of endogenous hormones."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
