Autoradiographs showed that within 48 h, the nucleolus progressively resumed the capacity to synthesize pre-rRNA molecules at a high rate. In quiescent embryos the nucleolus was small, compact and composed of mixed granular and fibrillar components. Within the first 6 h of germination a strong nucleolar vacuolation occurred, accompanied by a decrease in the volume of the nucleolus and a concomitant high loss of its ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). From 6 to 24 h, nucleolar vacuolation decreased to reach a stable level. During this last period the volume of the nucleolus increased by the accumulation of the fibrillar component resulting from a slow pre-rRNA processing. At 24 h the nucleolus presented a predominantly fibrillar texture. After 24 h, nucleolus growth continued but was due to the accumulation of the granular component, indicating that pre-rRNA processing occurred at a higher rate than during the first day of germination. From 48 h the nucleolus was composed of well-delineated granular and fibrillar areas. Dense nucleolus-associated chromatin as well as fibrillar centres were always observed during the whole period of observation. In addition, previous studies on the nucleolus of radicle cells of Zea mays embryo during early germination were completed by studying changes in the nucleolar volume and in the density of pre-ribosomal subunits of the granular component. On the basis of the data obtained with both species we suggest that a possible function for the nucleolar vacuoles is the increase in the nucleolus-nucleoplasm exchange interface in response to a rapid increase in the output of nucleolar RNPs. The nucleolar growth pattern during early germination is also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deltour", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Barsy", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0052457", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9533"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleolus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vacuoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4066797", "10.1242/jcs.76.1.67"]}}]}
