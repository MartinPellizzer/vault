Considering the high mortality rate of GBM, it is crucial to develop new treatment approaches. Conventional therapies, including maximal surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (typically temozolomide), have not led to significant changes in the survival rates of GBM patients. However, emerging modalities, such as the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, NF-\u03baB modulators, nitrosoureas, and immunotherapeutic agents have shown promising in improving GBM outcomes. In this context, we reviewed the current status of GBM treatment, the efficacy of existing standard therapies in improving disease outcomes, and future therapeutic directions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"}], "LastName": "Mohtashami", "ForeName": "Elmira", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran"}], "LastName": "Shafaei-Bajestani", "ForeName": "Negar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran"}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute (PMMHRI), Lodz, Poland"}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran"}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Amir R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Glioblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Immunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32664839", "10.2174/1389200221666200714101038", "CDM-EPUB-108154"]}}]}
