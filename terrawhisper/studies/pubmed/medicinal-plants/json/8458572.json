An initial comparison between the parental species, S. hamata cv. Verano and S. scabra cv. Fitzroy, demonstrated that 34% of detected RAPD bands were polymorphic. Of 90 primers tested, 35 showed relatively simple and reliably scorable polymorphisms and were used for segregation analysis. Sixty F2 individuals were scored for the segregation of 73 RAPD markers and 55 of these markers fit a 3:1 ratio. Segregation of eight other RAPD markers deviated significantly from a 3:1 ratio. There was no bias in the inheritance of RAPD markers regarding parental origin of the segregating RAPD markers. Linkage analysis revealed 10 linkage groups containing a total of 44 RAPD loci. Another 10 RAPD markers (7 of maternal origin) that were polymorphic between the parents did not segregate in the F2 population. One of the maternally inherited RAPD bands hybridized to chloroplast DNA. Analysis of RAPD loci by DNA hybridization indicated that mainly repeated sequences were amplified. These data indicate that RAPDs are useful genetic markers in Stylosanthes spp. and they may be suitable for genetic mapping."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Cunningham Laboratory, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kazan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Manners", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cameron", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crosses, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Amplification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8458572", "10.1139/g93-007"]}}]}
