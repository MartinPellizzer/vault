The measurements were carried out with photodiode array detection using a porous graphitized carbon column, and a water:dioxan 54:46 v/v eluent. Taxol was established as being present in measurable amounts in each Hungarian Taxus species. According to the results bark was richer in taxol than foliage. It could also be observed that the older the bark or foliage, the more taxol it contained. The validation process proved that the method is reliable and can be used for the separation and quantitative determination of taxol in both the bark and foliage of Taxus species grown in Hungary."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Research Institute for Chemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary."}], "LastName": "N\u00e9meth-Kiss", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Forg\u00e1cs", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cserh\u00e1ti", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schmidt", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hungary"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8818006", "10.1016/0731-7085(95)01682-1", "0731-7085(95)01682-1"]}}]}
