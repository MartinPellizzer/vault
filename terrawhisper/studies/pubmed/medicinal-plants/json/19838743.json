The present work was aimed at finding optimal culture conditions for Arnica plants in order to enable their successful reintroduction into their natural stands. Plants were cultivated under controlled greenhouse conditions on substrata with different nitrogen (N) concentration. As Arnica is always colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in nature, a fact that has been overlooked in other similar projects, we, here, applied and tested different inocula. We found that they differed in their effectiveness, both in establishing symbiosis, assessed by the colonization parameters, and in improving the performance of Arnica, evaluated by the photosynthetic parameters derived from the fluorescence transients (JIP-test), with the inocula containing G. intraradices or composed of several Glomus strains being the most effective. The comparison was possible only on substrata with medium N, since high N did not permit the formation of mycorrhiza, while at low N, few nonmycorrhizal plants survived until the measurements and mycorrhizal plants, which were well growing, exhibited a high heterogeneity. Analysis of secondary metabolites showed clearly that mycorrhization was associated with increased concentrations of phenolic acids in roots. For some of the inocula used, a tendency for increase of the level of phenolic acids in shoots and of sesquiterpene lactones, both in roots and in shoots, was also observed. We also studied the interactions between A. montana and Dactylis glomerata, known to compete with Arnica under field conditions. When specimens from both species were cultured together, there was no effect on D. glomerata, but Arnica could retain a photosynthetic performance that permitted survivability only in the presence of AMF; without AMF, the photosynthetic performance was lower, and the plants were eventually totally outcompeted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, University of Arhus, Forskerparken, Gustav Wiedsvej 10C, 8000, Arhus C, Denmark."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jurkiewicz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ryszka", "ForeName": "Przemyslaw", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anielska", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walig\u00f3rski", "ForeName": "Piotr", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bia\u0142o\u0144ska", "ForeName": "Dobroslawa", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3ralska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsimilli-Michael", "ForeName": "Merope", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turnau", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Mycorrhiza", "NlmUniqueID": "100955036", "ISSNLinking": "0940-6360"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arnica"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Dactylis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Mycorrhizae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Anal Chim Acta. 2008 May 5;614(2):196-200", "ArticleIdList": ["18420051"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 2008 Sep;74(18):5776-83", "ArticleIdList": ["18676711"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 2003 Sep;29(9):1955-79", "ArticleIdList": ["14584670"]}, {"Citation": "Mycorrhiza. 2005 Nov;15(8):596-605", "ArticleIdList": ["16133256"]}, {"Citation": "Phytochemistry. 2006 Feb;67(4):409-17", "ArticleIdList": ["16405933"]}, {"Citation": "Planta Med. 2004 Feb;70(2):166-70", "ArticleIdList": ["14994196"]}, {"Citation": "Mycorrhiza. 2009 Feb;19(2):113-123", "ArticleIdList": ["19011910"]}, {"Citation": "Mycorrhiza. 2003 Aug;13(4):191-8", "ArticleIdList": ["12938031"]}, {"Citation": "Mycorrhiza. 2006 Sep;16(6):443-446", "ArticleIdList": ["16909287"]}, {"Citation": "Electrophoresis. 2002 Jan;23(1):122-37", "ArticleIdList": ["11824612"]}, {"Citation": "Mycorrhiza. 2006 Oct;16(7):485-494", "ArticleIdList": ["16896796"]}, {"Citation": "Mycorrhiza. 2002 Jun;12(3):117-23", "ArticleIdList": ["12072981"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19838743", "10.1007/s00572-009-0280-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
