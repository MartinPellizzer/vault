Alternative oxidase(AOX) is one of the terminal oxidases of the plant mitochondrial electron transport, which plays an important role in plants' response to environmental stress. In order to reveal the physiological function of AOX gene in the process of agarwood formation from A.sinensis induced by wounding, AOX gene was cloned based on the transcriptome database and then identified by the bioinformatics analysis, and their expression pattern in different tissues and under wounding stress were detected by qRT-PCR. The results as follows. Three AOX genes were cloned from A.sinensis for the first time. They were named AsAOX1a, AsAOX1d and AsAOX2, respectively. The tissue expression shown that AsAOX1a is mainly expressed in the stem and the seed, and the AsAOX1d and AsAOX2 genes are mainly expressed in the pulp and the stem. AsAOX1a and AsAOX1d genes are highly responsive to wounding stress, and their response time was different. In addition, the expression of AsAOX1a and AsAOX2 induced by wounding are reduced by H_2O_2 treatment, but promoted by AsA treatment. The cloning, bioinformatics analysis and expression characteristics of AOX genes from A.sinensis provided basic information for further study the function of AOX genes in the development of A.sinensis, especially in the process of agarwood formation of A. sinensis induced by wounding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan
