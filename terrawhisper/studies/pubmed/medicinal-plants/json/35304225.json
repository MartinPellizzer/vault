Studies have shown that IFN-\u03b3 produced by Th1 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-17A secreted by Th17 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells played critical roles in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. We used different concentrations of artemisinin derivatives to inhibit Th1 / Th17 differentiation in naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and to characterize IFN-\u03b3 / IL-17A in in vitro experiments. The preliminary screening results showed that ester compound 5 exhibited obvious inhibitory activities on Th1 and Th17 (IFN-\u03b3 decreased from 41% to 3% and IL-17A decreased from 24% to 8% at the concentration of 10\u00a0nM to 10\u00a0\u03bcM), and carbamate compounds also had obvious inhibitory activities against Th17 at high concentration. Moreover, we investigated the effect of compound 5 on myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced mice experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in vivo. 100\u00a0mg/kg compound 5 effectively reduced the disease severity of EAE compared with the vehicle group. This research revealed that compound 5 could be a promising avenue as potential MS inhibitor."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
