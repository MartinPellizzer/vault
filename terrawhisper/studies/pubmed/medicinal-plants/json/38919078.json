However, their clinical application has been greatly hindered by various adverse factors such as non-specific activation and drug resistance. Compared with Pt(II) drugs, the axial ligands within Pt(IV) compounds can improve the pharmacokinetic properties, selectivity, and biological activity, implementing alternative cytotoxic mechanisms beyond DNA cross-linking and partially overcoming drug resistance. The controlled conversion of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) agents at the tumor site has been extensively explored internationally. In this review, Pt(IV) prodrug modification strategies are first summarized, next the development of the predominant external and internal photosensitizers is listed. Finally, three representative photoreduction mechanisms and strategies for developing corresponding Pt(IV) prodrugs are discussed. This work provides constructive instruction for the subsequent molecular design of Pt(IV) prodrugs. </p>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9861-7436"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lingkai", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Targeted Therapeutics and Innovation, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Kinase Modulators As Innovative Medicine, Chongqing Engineering Laboratory of Targeted and Innovative Therapeutics, International Academy of Targeted Therapeutics and Innovation, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, Chongqing, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yafei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Wenqin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Guangzhou", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Xinru", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Siyao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Leshan Normal University, Leshan, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Protein Pept Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100960529", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2037"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38919078", "10.2174/0113892037297416240525155628", "CPPS-EPUB-141264"]}}]}
