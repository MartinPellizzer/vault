These experiments are able to fully assign the proton and carbon resonances of all three classes of constituents present in dried commercial extract of St. John's wort, that is, flavonols, phloroglucinols, and naphthodianthrones, with particular regard to the very unstable phloroglucinols. In addition, shikimic and chlorogenic acids, sucrose, lipids, polyphenols, and traces of solvents of the extractive process (methanol) were also identified. These experiments can be considered to be a very simple and fast analytical method for determining the quality and stability of the titled commercial extract. They represent a generally applicable technique for a rapid screening and a specific measurement of other commercial phytochemicals or, in selected cases, an alternative to the classical analytical techniques such as high-performance thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, capillary gas chromatography, and electrophoresis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, via Gino Capponi 9, 50121 Florence, Italy. ar.bilia@unifi.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bilia", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bergonzi", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mazzi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vincieri", "ForeName": "F F", "Initials": "FF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11368564", "10.1021/jf000999+", "jf000999+"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
