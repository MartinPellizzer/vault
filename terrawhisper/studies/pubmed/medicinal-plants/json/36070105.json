Our previous study demonstrated that its active fraction, prepared from Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba, exerts an obvious beneficial effect on asthma. However, the pharmacokinetics of its major constituents remain unclear. Therefore, an ultra-performance mass spectrometry-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was successfully established to simultaneously perform the pharmacokinetics of the main 11 components of the active fraction between normal and ovalbumin-induced asthmatic mice. Compared to the normal group, in asthmatic mice the peak concentration of arbutin, marmesin, caffeoylquinic acids, and flavonoid glycosides clearly increased, while for luteolin it significantly declined; the area under the curve for arbutin and luteolin showed an increase, but the values of marmesin, caffeoylquinic acids, and flavonoid glycosides revealed a decline; the peak time for arbutin, caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoid glycosides decreased, while for marmesin and luteolin it significantly augmented; apart from marmesin, the half-life for all compounds shortened significantly. It is indicated that the pathology of asthma could lead to an alteration in the pharmacokinetic profiles of the 11 components in plasma, providing a reference for further exploration of the pharmacodynamic basis of the anti-bronchial effect of Gerberae Piloselloidis Herba."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM, Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, P.
