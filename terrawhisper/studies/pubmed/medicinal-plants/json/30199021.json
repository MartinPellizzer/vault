In order to adjust to stressful changes (e.g., drought and high salinity), higher plants evolve classes of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to reduce oxidative and osmotic stress. This article uses a combination of capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and mobility shift affinity electrophoresis (ACE) in order to describe the binding behavior of different conformers of the IDP AtHIRD11 from Arabidopsis thaliana. CGE is used to confirm the purity of AtHIRD11 and to exclude fragments, posttranslational modifications, and other impurities as reasons for complex peak patterns. In this part of the experiment, the different sample components are separated by a viscous gel inside a capillary by their different masses and detected with a diode array detector. Afterward, the binding behavior of the sample towards various metal ions is investigated by ACE. In this case, the ligand is added to the buffer solution and the shift in migration time is measured in order to determine whether a binding event has occurred or not. One of the advantages of using the combination of CGE and ACE to determine the binding behavior of an IDP is the possibility to automate the gel electrophoresis and the binding assay. Furthermore, CGE shows a lower limit of detection than the classical gel electrophoresis and ACE is able to determine the manner of binding a ligand in a fast manner. In addition, ACE can also be applied to other charged species than metal ions. However, the use of this method for binding experiments is limited in its ability to determine the number of binding sites. Nevertheless, the combination of CGE and ACE can be adapted for characterizing the binding behavior of any protein sample towards numerous charged ligands."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, TU Braunschweig; m.nachbar@tu-braunschweig.de."}], "LastName": "Nachbar", "ForeName": "Markus", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, TU Braunschweig."}], "LastName": "Maul", "ForeName": "Jorrit", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, TU Braunschweig."}], "LastName": "Stein", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, TU Braunschweig."}], "LastName": "W\u00e4tzig", "ForeName": "Hermann", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HIRD11 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Hara M.
