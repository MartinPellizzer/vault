The present study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory constituents from traditional medicinal plant, Tinospora cordifolia (willd.). Our study resulted in the isolation of new compound, 27-hydroxy octacosyl ferulate (1) along with eleven known compounds (2-12). The structures of the isolated compounds were characterized by combination of NMR (1D and 2D) and Mass spectroscopic methods. The hemisynthesis of compound 12 (ferulic acid) yielded (12a-12d and 12e-12\u00a0m) derivatives. Further, the isolated compounds and synthesized derivatives were assessed for their immunomodulatory potentials by evaluating their cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory effects against macrophage cells (IL-6) and DC activation markers (CD 11c and 86). The biological results indicated that crude extract displayed potent immunomodulatory activity while isolated compounds and synthetic analogues showed moderate activity. Among the tested compounds, new compound (1), quercetin (10) and derivatives 12b, 12c found to be non-cytotoxic and displayed immunomodulatory potentials. Therefore, these compounds can be studied for autoimmunity and other immune suppressing conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
