(Primulaceae), naturally distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, has edible and medicinal values and is prevalent in clinical and daily use in China. More genetic information for distinct species delineation is needed to support the development and utilization of the genus Ardisia. We sequenced, annotated, and compared the chloroplast genomes of five Ardisia species: A. brunnescens, A. pusilla, A. squamulosa, A. crenata, and A. brevicaulis in this study. We found a typical quadripartite structure in all five chloroplast genomes, with lengths ranging from 155,045 to 156,943\u00a0bp. Except for A. pusilla, which lacked the ycf15 gene, the other four Ardisia species contained 114 unique genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs, and four rRNAs. In addition, the rps19 pseudogene gene was present only in A. brunnescens. Five highly variable DNA barcodes were identified for five Ardisia species, including trnT-GGU-psbD, trnT-UGU-trnL-UAA, rps4-trnT-UGU, rpl32-trnL-UAG, and rpoB-trnC-GAA. The RNA editiing sites of protein-coding genes in the five Ardisia plastome were characterized and compared, and 274 (A. crenata)-288 (A. brevicaulis) were found. The results of the phylogenetic analysis were consistent with the morphological classification. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that ycf15 genes were highly divergent in Primulaceae. Reconstructions of ancestral character states indicated that leaf margin morphology is critical for classifying the genus Ardisia, with a rodent-like character being the most primitive. These results provide valuable information on the taxonomy and evolution of Ardisia plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
