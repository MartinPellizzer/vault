This pectin (M<sub>w</sub> of 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup> g/mol) contained the ~59.1% homogalacturonan (HG) and ~38.1% highly branched rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) region with possible side chains embracing arabinogalactan II, arabinan or arabinogalactan I. The fragments including HG backbone consisting of\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b1-GalpA-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0and\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b1-GalpA-6-O-methyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0with molar ratio of ~2:1, and repeating unit of arabinogalactan II side chain composed of \u03b1-Araf-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0and\u00a0\u2192\u00a03,6)-\u03b2-Galp-(1\u2192, were speculated through methylation analysis and NMR spectra. However, the linkage pattern for RG-I backbone and side chains were indiscernible due to limited resolution of NMR spectra. Besides, the pectin adopted a flexible chain conformation in 0.1\u00a0M NaNO<sub>3</sub> solution. These results provided a structural basis for study on polysaccharide from D. opposite, which was benefit for development of functional food of yam."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
