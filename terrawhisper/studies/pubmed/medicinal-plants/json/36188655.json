Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the properties of two medicinal plants - the fine-scaled larch (<i>L\u00e1rix Ka\u00e9mpferi</i>) and Siberian larch (<i>L\u00e1rix Sibirica</i>), which are growing in the Republic of Kazakhstan. We compared the two types of larches according to botanical affiliation and species description. We studied the alcoholic extracts from <i>L\u00e1rix Ka\u00e9mpferi</i> and <i>L\u00e1rix Sibirica</i> to determine their physical and chemical properties. The data on the chemical composition of extractive compounds were generalized and systematized. The authenticity of <i>L\u00e1rix Ka\u00e9mpferi</i> and <i>L\u00e1rix Sibirica</i> was established by external, anatomical, and diagnostic signs in microscopic examination and qualitative reactions. Specific indicators and their norms for raw materials were identified. This is the standard for both types of larch and determines their quality. We experimented with grinding fineness for studied materials and tested the impurities and moisture content of raw materials, total ash, and ash insoluble in a 10% hydrochloric acid solution. Determination of heavy metals and radionuclides was also considered. The quality specifications were developed based on the standardization of fine-scaled larch and Siberian larch."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a92022 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Chemistry, Pharmacognosy and Botany, Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University, Almaty, The Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Sayakova", "ForeName": "Galiya", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Chemistry, Pharmacognosy and Botany, Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University, Almaty, The Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Boshkayeva", "ForeName": "Assyl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Non-profit Stock Corporation KazNMU, Almaty, The Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Ibadullayeva", "ForeName": "Galiya", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Chemistry, Pharmacognosy and Botany, Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University, Almaty, The Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Khamitova", "ForeName": "Akzhonas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Chemistry, Pharmacognosy and Botany, Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University, Almaty, The Republic of Kazakhstan."}], "LastName": "Begimova", "ForeName": "Gulzeynep", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Romania", "MedlineTA": "J Med Life", "NlmUniqueID": "101477617", "ISSNLinking": "1844-122X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QTT17582CB", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrochloric Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrochloric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kazakhstan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Larix"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "World Health Organization  .
