The total and exchangeable concentrations of twelve elements in the growth soils and their distribution in the roots, potato bulb and leaves of the plants grown under four different settings were compared. The typical concentrations of the twelve selected elements, in the bulb and leaves of the plant grown in a nursery pot (site 2) were (in microg g(-1)dry weight) Ca (8430 and 27075), Mg (2113 and 1566), Fe (66 and 150), Al (10 and 368), Zn (105 and 6.1), Mn (42 and 51), Cu (7.2 and 20.8), Ba (0.23 and 4.44), Co (0.20 and 0.42), As (2.05 and 24.56), Hg (0.92 and 1.82) and Cr (0.13 and 0.33). Except for Ca, Mg, Zn and Mn, the exchangeable cation concentrations in all the growth soils were low. Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn and As had bioaccumulation factors >1. Fe, Al and Co concentrations were high in the roots with little in the rest of the plant. High concentration of arsenic (approximately 13 microg g(-1) dry weight) with bioaccumulation factors of 7 and 20 were observed in the roots and leaves of the plant respectively (site 2), but the concentration of mercury in bulb was very low (0.92 microg g(-1) dry weight)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville Campus, Chiltern Hills, Durban, South Africa. jonnalagaddas@ukzn.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jonnalagadda", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kindness", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubayi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cele", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18368548", "10.1080/03601230701771461", "791733708"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
