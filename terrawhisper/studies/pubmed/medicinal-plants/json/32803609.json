The phytotoxic activity of encapsulated savory EO on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and amaranth weed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) was investigated. The micro-capsules were evaluated in terms of size, polydispersity, stability, encapsulation efficiency, morphology, and release properties. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model operated when EO was being released from the micro-capsules. Carvacrol (52.5%) and \u03b3-terpinene (30.2%) comprised the main constituents of the savory EO. Based on the results, encapsulating the EO with cross-linked biopolymers increased the stability and herbicidal activity of EO, as compared to simple EO emulsions. Maximum toxicity injuries (MTI) were caused by encapsulations of apple pectin, cross-linked with APe enzyme (15\u00a0ml/L) on both plant species. MTI were observed 2\u00a0days after using the micro-encapsulated herbicides (MCHs). However, the injury caused by MCHs on tomato was not significant. The lowest values of fresh weight (2.80\u00a0g), chlorophyll a (0.194\u00a0mg/g Fw), and total chlorophyll content (0.219\u00a0mg/g Fw) of amaranth occurred in response to APe (15\u00a0ml/L). Moreover, using AP(e) (10\u00a0ml/L) caused the lowest values of starch (0.444\u00a0mg/g Fw) and flavonoid contents (4.18\u00a0mg Cat/g Fw) in amaranth which measured as 59% and 90% reductions, respectively, in comparison with the control. The highest values of MDA (0.0109\u00a0nmol/g Fw) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.0432\u00a0\u03bcmol/g Fw) were observed in amaranth plants treated with AP(e) (10\u00a0ml/L). In summary, cross-linked apple pectin can perform well in slow release delivery systems of agrochemicals. It can be recommended for use in the production of commercial, EO-based natural herbicides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, 71441-65186, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taban", "ForeName": "Azin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, 71441-65186, Iran.
