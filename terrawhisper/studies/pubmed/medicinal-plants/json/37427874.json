Metabolomic profiling has demonstrated that bornyl diphosphate (BPP)-related terpenoids are more abundant in the W. villosa seeds and have a wider tissue distribution in W. longiligularis. To explore the genetic mechanisms underlying the volatile terpenoid divergence, a high-quality chromosome-level genome of W. longiligularis (2.29 Gb, contig N50 of 80.39 Mb) was assembled. Functional characterization of 17 terpene synthases (WlTPSs) revealed that WlBPPS, along with WlTPS 24/26/28 with bornyl diphosphate synthase (BPPS) activity, contributes to the wider tissue distribution of BPP-related terpenoids in W. longiligularis compared to W. villosa. Furthermore, transgenic Nicotiana tabacum showed that the GCN4-motif element positively regulates seed expression of WvBPPS and thus promotes the enrichment of BPP-related terpenoids in W. villosa seeds. Systematic identification and analysis of candidate TPS in 29 monocot plants from 16 families indicated that substantial expansion of TPS-a and TPS-b subfamily genes in Zingiberaceae may have driven increased diversity and production of volatile terpenoids. Evolutionary analysis and functional identification of BPPS genes showed that BPP-related terpenoids may be distributed only in the Zingiberaceae of monocot plants. This research provides valuable genomic resources for breeding and improving Fructus Amomi with medicinal and edible value and sheds light on the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis in Zingiberaceae."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 American Society of Plant Biologists 2023.
