Effectively clearing microbes in infected wound via non-antibiotic therapy is crucial for the promotion of recovery in complex biological environments, and the wound healing is a crucial process after sterilization to avoid superinfection. Herein, a kind of Prussian blue-based photothermal responsive gel, Bletilla striata polysaccharide-mingled, isatin-functionalized Prussian blue gel (PB-ISA/BSP gel) was reported for effective treatment of bacterial infection and wound healing. The introduction of effective components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), isatin (ISA), enhanced the efficiency of sterilization synergistically. Furthermore, the process of wound healing was promoted by Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSP). PB-ISA@BSP had a considerable antibacterial rate with 98.5\u00a0% under an 808\u00a0nm laser for 10\u00a0min in vitro. Besides, PB-ISA/BSP gel showed an effective antibacterial efficacy in vivo and a fast wound healing rate as well. The as-prepared functional particles can invade and destroy bacteria membrane to kill microbes. This work highlights that PB-ISA/BSP gel is a promising antibacterial agent based on synergistically enhanced photothermal effect and wound healing promotion ability and provides inspiration for future therapy based on the synergy between photothermal agent and active components in TCM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
