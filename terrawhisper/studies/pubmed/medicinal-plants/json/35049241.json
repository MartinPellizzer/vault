Conventional Western medicine has limited efficacy in treating IBS. Tongsayobang (TSYB) is a traditional Korean medicine that has been used to treat lower intestinal problems. This study provides a procedure for conducting a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of TSYB for IBS.", "The main electronic databases will be searched up to May 2021 for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of TSYB or modified TSYB on patients with IBS. The primary outcome will be the overall efficacy rate. The secondary outcome will be data such as IBS-related quality of life, global symptom scores, and adverse events. This study will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, and will involve a meta-analysis, if possible. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Risk of Bias tool from the Cochrane Handbook, version 6.1.0.", "Ethical approval is not required because this study does not include any participants' personal information.", "DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/M32BK (https://osf.io/m32bk)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 the Author(s).
