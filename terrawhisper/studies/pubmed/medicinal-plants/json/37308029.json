AR is used in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions to treat hyperuricemia, but this particular effect is rarely reported, and the associated mechanism of action is still need to be elucidated.", "To research the uric acid (UA)-lowering activity and mechanism of AR and the representative compounds through the constructed hyperuricemia mouse and cellular models.", "In our study, the chemical profile of AR was analysed by UHPLC-QE-MS, as well as the mechanism of action of AR and the representative compounds on hyperuricemia was studied through the constructed hyperuricemia mouse and cellular models.", "The main compounds in AR were terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids. Mice group treated with the highest AR dosage showed significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) serum uric acid (208\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) than the control group (317\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0\u03bcmol/L). Furthermore, UA increased in a dose-dependence manner in urine and faeces. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen standards, as well as xanthine oxidase in mice liver, decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in all cases, indicating that AR could relieve acute hyperuricemia. UA reabsorption protein (URAT1 and GLUT9) was down-regulated in AR administration groups, while the secretory protein (ABCG2) was up-regulated, indicating that AR could promote the excretion of UA by regulating UA transporters via PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.", "This study validated the activity, and revealed the mechanism of AR in reducing UA, which provided experimental and clinical basis for the treatment of hyperuricemia with it."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
