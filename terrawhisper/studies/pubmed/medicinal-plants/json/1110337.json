Atrial flutter rates increased during exercise testing in four patients. Improved A-V conduction with consequent higher ventricular rates occurred during exercise in thirteen subjects. One patient, with 4:1 conduction at rest, continued with 4:1 block throughout exercise testing, was believed to be over-digitalized. During the recovery period after exercise, ten patients transiently developed periods of Wenckebach A-V block. Walking exercise induced 1:1 conduction in six patients and was promoted by the following circumstances: 1) atrial rates of 250/min or less; 2) inadequate dosage of digitalis; and 3) the administration of quinidine. For the patient with chronic atrial flutter, treadmill testing provides a simple method for demonstrating the range of changes of A-V conduction and for deriving implications for appropriate drug therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gooch", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sumathisena", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Electrocardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0153605", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0736"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9Y8NXQ24VQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Propranolol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ITX08688JL", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Atrial Flutter"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Conduction System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Propranolol"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinidine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1110337", "10.1016/s0022-0736(75)80036-7"]}}]}
