Then they were chromatographied on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm ID, 1.7 microm) at 40 degrees C. The mobile phase A consisted of water and 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase B consisted of methanol and 0.1% formic acid. The analytes were eluted from the column with a linear gradient from 5% B to 80% B in 5 min, then hold for 0.5 min before returning to initial condition. The flow rate was 0.35 mL x min(-1). A tandem mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization source was used as detector. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using the precursor to product ion pairs of m/z 447-->271 (for baicalin), m/z 353-->191 (for chlorogenic acid) and m/z 287-->287 (for internal standard) were used to quantification. The linear concentration ranges of the calibration curves for baicalin and chlorogenic acid ranged from 9.6 to 1540 ng x mL(-1) and from 7.5 to 1200 ng x mL(-1), respectively. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD) across three validations run over the entire concentration range was less than 10.2% for both baicalin and chlorogenic acid. After iv infusion of Yinhuang injection to the volunteers, the concentration-time curves of baicalin and chlorogenic acid fitted the two-compartment and three-compartment model. T(1/2)alpha were (4.47 +/- 0.89) and (7.65 +/- 4.42) min, T(1/2)beta were (46.22 +/- 10.03) and (34.40 +/- 19.16) min, respectively. The method was proved to be highly sensitive, selective, and suitable for pharmacokinetic investigations of both baicalin and chlorogenic acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China. njwz1008@jlonline.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Wen-zheng", "Initials": "WZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Xiao-yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Heng-shan", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xing", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Ning-ning", "Initials": "NN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "347Q89U4M5", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18229616"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
