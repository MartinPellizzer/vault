The traditional use of plants as medicines, including the treatment of infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, is generally practiced in communities that are geographically isolated or in human settlements where health services are scarce.", "The aim of this review is to evaluate current research advances in the ethnopharmacology and phytochemistry of Mexican medicinal plants exhibiting antiprotozoal activity, used to treat diarrhoea, and to identify the gaps in this research area for future studies.", "The literature study and compilation of information relied on books and scientific journals from leading electronic databases including Scopus, Springer, SciFinder, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar; the topics searched for were antiprotozoal activity, followed by Entamoeba histolytica or Giardia lamblia. Ethnopharmacological data were obtained from books regarding medicinal plants and their uses in Mexico as well as from the government databases of \"Comisi\u00f2n Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO)\" as \"NaturaLista\" and \"EncicloVida\".", "A total of 80 plant species used in the Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of diarrhoea have been evaluated as potential sources of antiprotozoal agents against E. histolytica or G. lamblia. From these samples, 150 compounds have been isolated and screened in vitro, including specialized metabolites such as flavonoids and terpenoids as well as semisynthesized derivatives. However, in vivo pharmacological studies on these substances are limited. Additional pharmacological and molecular studies of the most active compounds have also been summarized.", "Research performed in the past 25 years on specialized metabolites derived from plants with antiprotozoal activity has yielded relevant findings whose results provide evidence-based support for the use of these plants in the traditional medicine of Mexico to treat diarrhoea. Toxicological and clinical trials of standardized extracts and bioactive compounds are proposed as priority future works in this research area. In addition, in vivo assays are required, of more extracts and/or pure compounds. The optimization of the pharmacological properties of the bioactive specialized metabolites through semisynthetic derivatives and computational methods could aid in developing new antiprotozoal phytomedicines and novel drugs for the treatment of these types of infections. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanism of action of these bioactive compounds through pharmacological and molecular studies are also necessary."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
