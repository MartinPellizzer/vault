The rhizobia from the alkaline soil showed significantly higher salt tolerance than those isolated from neutral soil. Upper limits of stress survival of rhizobial isolates, Rhizobium sp. NBRI0102 sesbania selected from neutral soil, and Rhizobium sp. NBRI2505 sesbania selected from alkaline soil, were studied under free living conditions. Rhizobium sp. NBRI0102 sesbania and Rhizobium sp. NBRI2505 sesbania tolerated yeast extract mannitol broth (YEB) containing 10% and 28% salt (NaCl, wt/vol) for up to 18 h of incubation at 30 degrees C. Growth of Rhizobium sp. NBRI0102 sesbania and Rhizobium sp. NBRI2505 sesbania at pH 7, 11, and 12 was identical, except for a lag period of about 10 h in the growth of Rhizobium sp. NBRI0102 sesbania at pH 11 and 12, as compared with pH 7. Rhizobium sp. NBRI0102 sesbania and Rhizobium sp. NBRI2505 sesbania survived at 50 degrees C and 65 degrees C, in YEB at pH 7 for up to 4 and 2 h, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rhizobia demonstrating survival of Rhizobium sp. NBRI2505 sesbania, estimated by counting viable cells, to such extreme conditions of salt and temperature, individually. In contrast to Rhizobium sp. NBRI0102 sesbania, high temperature was tolerated efficiently by Rhizobium sp. NBRI2505 sesbania, in the presence of salt at higher pH. Our results suggest that the possession of the trait of high salt tolerance might be of some evolutionary significance for the survival of rhizobia in alkaline soils, at high pH and temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology Group, National Botanical Research Institute, P.B.
