It is a multi-system disorder that includes joints and metabolic syndromes. Psoriasis is a condition of pathologic interaction among immune cells, biological signaling molecules and skin cells. Several contributing factors are responsible for the exacerbation and onset of psoriasis, i.e. genetic factors and environmental factors such as medications, infectious diseases and lifestyle.", "To study the new insights in the treatment of psoriasis and future prospects.", "This review article gives an insight on the current concepts of psoriasis and deals with discussing the initiation and development of the diseases.
