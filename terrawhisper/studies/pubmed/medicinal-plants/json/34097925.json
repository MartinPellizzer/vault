TAZ and YAP are transcriptional coactivators which are recognized as relay proteins that promote mechano-transduction within the Hippo pathway. With regard to healthy cells in homeostasis, mechano-transduction regularly restricts proliferation, and TAZ and YAP are totally inactive. During cancer development a YAP/TAZ - stimulating positive response loop is formed between the growing tumor and the stiffening ECM. As tumor developments, local stromal and cancerous cells take advantage of mechanotransduction to enhance proliferation, induce their migratory into remote tissues, and promote chemotherapeutic resistance. As a newly progresses paradigm, nanoparticle-conjunctions (such as magnetic nanoparticles, and graphene derivatives nanoparticles) hold significant promises for remote regulation of cells and their relevant events at molecular scale. Despite outstanding developments in employing nanoparticles for drug targeting studies, the role of nanoparticles on cellular behaviors (proliferation, migration, and differentiation) has still required more evaluations in the field of mechanotherapy. In this paper, the in-depth contribution of mechano-transduction is discussed during tumor progression, and how these consequences can be evaluated in vitro."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
