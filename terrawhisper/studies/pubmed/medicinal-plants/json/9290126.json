The present study was designed to investigate the following parameters: 1) DMBA-DNA adduct formation in liver and mammary gland, 2) urinary excretion of DMBA metabolites, 3) phase I and phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, and 4) tissue selenium levels as a function of Se-garlic supplementation. Prior feeding with an Se-garlic-containing diet (at 3 ppm Se) for two weeks resulted in a consistent reduction of all DMBA adducts in liver and mammary gland. This was accompanied by a 40% increase in urinary excretion of DMBA metabolites over a two-day period. Several liver P-450 enzymes were examined in rats fed a diet supplemented with 1, 2, or 3 ppm Se. Compared with controls receiving 0.1 ppm Se, no significant alteration in activity was detected with respect to P-450 1A1 (responsible for DMBA activation), 1A2, 2B1, 2E1, and 3A4. In contrast, glutathione S-transferase and uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase activities were elevated to a maximum of 2- to 2.5-fold in liver and kidney. As expected, there was a dose-dependent elevation of selenium concentrations in liver, kidney, mammary gland, and plasma as a function of the level of Se-garlic supplementation. Our data seem to suggest that an increased detoxification of carcinogen via the phase II conjugating enzymes might represent a mechanism of tumor suppression by Se-garlic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgical Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. cip@sc3101.med.buffalo.edu"}], "LastName": "Ip", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lisk", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-27706", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xenobiotics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronosyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronosyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Glands, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Xenobiotics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9290126", "10.1080/01635589709514573"]}}]}
