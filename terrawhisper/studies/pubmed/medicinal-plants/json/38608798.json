In particular, almost all species in the genus have traditionally been used as folk medicine to treat ailments. Traditional application records indicated that Cymbopogon might be used extensively to treat cold, dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, rheumatism, diarrhea, whole grass for cold, sore throat, tracheitis and others.", "Despite several research confirmed that Cymbopogon includes a range of active components, no review has been undertaken to consolidate information on its traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and/or quality control. Thus this article aims to update a comprehensive review about the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, cultivation techniques, economic benefits, trade, threats, and future conservation implications of Cymbopogon species. It may provide informative data for future development and further investigation of this important plant group.", "Traditional medicinal books and ethnomedicinal publications related to Cymbopogon from 1992 to 2023 were collated to investigate its ethnobotanical, phytochemical and pharmacological information. The online databases including Google Scholar, SciFinder, Web of Science, Scopus, Springer Link, PubMed, Wiley, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Baidu Scholar, and WanFang Database were screened.", "Cymbopogon (Gramineae or Poaceae) plants have been grown worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine and other medicinal systems believes that Cymbopogon has the effect of relieve a cough, analgesia, treating dizziness, traumatic injury and can relieve abdominal pain. A total of 153 compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, fatty acid and other compounds were isolated or identified from Cymbopogon species by phytochemical studies. The extracts or compounds from Cymbopogon have exhibited numerous biological activities such as antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antiviral, antineoplastic, antiarrhythmic, antidiabetic and other activities. The rich contents of citronellal, citronellol and geraniol found in Cymbopogon also provide significant nutritional benefits.", "Based on their traditional uses, phytochemicals, and pharmacological activities, Cymbopogon plants are potential medicinal and edible resources with diverse pharmacological effects. Due to various advantages of this group, they possess huge application potential in food and pharmaceutical industries, and animal husbandry. Among them, citronella is very important in terms of economic development. Further comprehensive research to evaluate the medicinal properties of Cymbopogon species will be necessary for future development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
