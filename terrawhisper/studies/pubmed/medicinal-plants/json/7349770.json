They suggest that during pregnancy, lactation, childhood, and adolescence drastic control of oral intake of unessential hazardous food items be advocated for cancer control effective through adulthood. The sensitivity to carcinogenic initiators is shown to be great during growth periods in and out of the womb. During this dynamic developmental stage, criteria for safe levels of intake on an aggregate body weight basis remain indefinite.
