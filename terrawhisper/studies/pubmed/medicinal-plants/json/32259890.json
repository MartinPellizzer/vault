The effects of <i>breviscapine</i> on neurological deficit score, brain tissue water content, brain pathological tissue changes, blood-brain barrier bidirectional regulation, and inflammatory factors after cerebral hemorrhage in rats were observed. Western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to explore how Periostin and nuclear factor kappa-B pathway-related factors protein expression contribute to the protective effects of <i>breviscapine</i> on brain injury. <i>Breviscapine</i> inhalation could reduce neurological deficit scores and brain tissue water content. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that <i>breviscapine</i> could improve the pathological changes of brain tissue and alleviate brain damage. <i>Breviscapine</i> reduced the abnormal increase of Evans blue content caused by a cerebral hemorrhage, and could significantly inhibit the levels of inflammatory factors interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. Also, <i>breviscapine</i> significantly inhibited the expressions of Periostin and nuclear factor kappa-B pathway-related factors after cerebral hemorrhage, and alleviate brain damage by down-regulating Periostin expression and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-\u03b2 signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Chen et al.
