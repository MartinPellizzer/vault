Bio-Normalizer upregulated interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced NO production by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Such an effect of Bio-Normalizer on NO production was not due to changes in the activity of iNOS. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the levels of iNOS mRNA were augmented by treatment of the cells with Bio-Normalizer and IFN-gamma. The ability of Bio-Normalizer to augment IFN-gamma-induced iNOS mRNA expression was independent of any changes on the mRNA stability. Treatment of cells with Bio-Normalizer alone did not affect NO production by macrophages. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta are involved in the induction of iNOS gene as well as the immune system. Bio-Normalizer augmented the mRNA expression of these cytokines in the presence of IFN-gamma. This suggests that Bio-Normalizer is not directly involved in the expression of iNOS, but shows synergistic interaction with IFN-gamma to induce NO synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Energy and Environment Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California 94720-3200, USA."}], "LastName": "Kobuchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Packer", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM 27345", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Mol Biol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9306673", "ISSNLinking": "1039-9712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9315292", "10.1080/15216549700203911"]}}]}
