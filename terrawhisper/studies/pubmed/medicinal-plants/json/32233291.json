HP, consisting of Ammon's horn (CA) and the dentate gyrus (DG), is an important component of the limbic system, involved in learning and memory processes. CA showed a higher immunoreactivity of CART (-IR) compared to DG. CART-IR neurons were mainly observed in the molecular layer of DG and in the pyramidal layer of CA. CART-IR fibers were present in the granular layer; in the hilus numerous mossy fibers were detected, while in the molecular layer CART-IR fibers were not found. In all CA fields (CA1-CA3), CART-IR fibers were only present in the lacuno- sum-molecular layer. Immunofluorescence with double- labeling showed that only CART-IR cells stained positive for PV, whereas in CART-IR fibers there was no PV-positive reaction. Our research supplements missing knowledge about the distribution and colocalization pattern of CART with PV in the chinchilla's hippocampus, and also provides a better understanding of the similarities and differences among individuals of the same species and also with other mammals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Polish Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Science, Akademicka 12, 20-950 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Szalak", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Science, Akademicka 12, 20-950 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Matysek", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Unit, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kukula-Koch", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Science, Akademicka 12, 20-950 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Rycerz", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Science, Akademicka 12, 20-950 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Zacharko-Siembida", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Life Science, Akademicka 12, 20-950 Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Arciszewski", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pol J Vet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101125473", "ISSNLinking": "1505-1773"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nerve Tissue Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parvalbumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript protein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chinchilla"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nerve Tissue Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Parvalbumins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32233291", "10.24425/pjvs.2020.132752"]}}]}
