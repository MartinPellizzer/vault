One of the most common is maceration of herbs in alcohol. Different substances respond differently to extraction in prepared solutions. It is very important to enhance the highest proportion of beneficial ingredients during the maceration process in a herbal liqueur. A comparative analysis of numerous different phenolic compounds from eight of the most frequently used herbs for making aperitifs in Europe was performed.", "In the comparison among all studied herbs, the highest phenolic content was found with Artemisia absinthium (wormwood) (14.61\u2009mg\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> ) and Mentha piperita (peppermint) (13.89\u2009mg\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> ), while the lowest content was found with Centaurium erythraea (common centaury) (3.96\u2009mg\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> ). Salvianolic acid isomers and caffeic acid derivatives were the greatest contributors to the total phenolic content in lemon balm, wormwood, peppermint, fennel and sage. These compounds contain more hydroxyl groups and they were better extracted at the beginning of the maceration process. Caraway and common centaury contain more flavonols (quercetin and kaempferol derivatives), with higher chemical stability and fewer hydroxyl groups in their structure.", "The compositions of eight herbal liqueurs were highly related to the presence of different herbal ingredients and their solubility in the extract over time. Most flavonol derivatives were extracted over a longer time and the two liqueurs (common centaury and caraway) therefore had the highest phenolic contents after 3\u2009weeks of maceration. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4626-9729"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair for Fruit Growing, Viticulture and Vegetable Growing, Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "Senica", "ForeName": "Mateja", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair for Fruit Growing, Viticulture and Vegetable Growing, Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "Mikulic-Petkovsek", "ForeName": "Maja", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P4-0013-0481", "Agency": "Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alcoholic Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Centaurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "De Sousa AC, Gattass CR, Alviano DS, Alviano CS, Blank AF and Alves PB, Melissa officinalis L. essential oil: antitumoral and antioxidant activities.
