The lead indole, FKK6, displayed PXR-dependent protective effects in DSS-induced colitis in mice and in vitro cytokine-treated intestinal organoid cultures. Here, we report on the initial in vitro pharmacological profiling of FKK6. FKK6-PXR interactions were characterized by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Screening FKK6 against potential cellular off-targets (G protein-coupled receptors, steroid and nuclear receptors, ion channels, and xenobiotic membrane transporters) revealed high PXR selectivity. FKK6 has poor aqueous solubility but was highly soluble in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. A large fraction of FKK6 was bound to plasma proteins and chemically stable in plasma. The partition coefficient of FKK6 was 2.70, and FKK6 moderately partitioned into red blood cells. In Caco2 cells, FKK6 displayed high permeability (A-B: 22.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6\u00a0cm.s<sup>-1</sup>) and no active efflux. These data are indicative of essentially complete in vivo absorption of FKK6. The data from human liver microsomes indicated that FKK6 is rapidly metabolized by cytochromes P450 (t<sub>1/2</sub> 5\u00a0min), notably by CYP3A4. Two oxidized FKK6 derivatives, including DC73 (N6-oxide) and DC97 (C19-phenol), were detected, and these metabolites had 5-7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0lower potency as PXR agonists than FKK6. This implies that despite high intestinal absorption, FKK6 is rapidly eliminated by the liver, and its PXR effects are predicted to be predominantly in the intestines. In conclusion, the PXR ligand and agonist FKK6 has a suitable pharmacological profile supporting its potential preclinical development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
