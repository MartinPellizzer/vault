Lindl. is a subtropical evergreen tree with economic and medicinal value. In 2021-2022, leaf-spot symptoms were observed on the leaves of E. japonica in Nanchang city, Jiangxi Province, China (28\u00b068'N, 115\u00b095'E). The disease incidence was 30% (20 diseased plants/60 surveyed plants). Symptoms included brown spots that gradually turned dark brown. The lesions were ca. 3-8 mm, and coalescing into irregular or round large lesions. Black acervuli were observed within the lesions. The margin of the diseased tissues was cut and surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 10 s and 0.1% (v/v) mercuric chloride for 1 min, followed by three rinses in sterile water. Thirteen single spore isolates were purified and deposited in the Mycological Herbarium of Jiangxi Agricultural University. After 7 days, the colonies were grey-white with dense aerial mycelium. Conidia were uni-celled, hyaline and cylindrical. The sizes of the conidia were 12.6 to 17.5 \u00d7 4.2 to 6.5 \u03bcm. Appressoria were oval to irregular in shape and dark brown in color. These characteristics were consistent with descriptions of Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Weir et al. 2012; Rodr\u00edguez-Palafox et al. 2021). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), calmodulin (CAL), and actin (ACT) genes were amplified and sequenced (Diao et al. 2017). The sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers ON631874, ON642546, ON642547 and ON642548, respectively. BLASTn searches confirmed high identity (>99%) with the type-strain of C. siamense (MH863513, KC297007, JX009702, JX009549). The concatenated sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The present isolate JXCS1 formed a single clade with the C. siamense. For pathogenicity, the leaves of two-year-old seedlings (cv. Dawuxing) were inoculated with 10 \u00b5L of spore suspension (1\u00d7106 conidia/mL). Leaves inoculated with sterile distilled water served as controls. Each treatment was replicated three times. Five days post-inoculation, water-soaked lesions appeared on the leaves, lesions gradually expanded into large round necrotic spots. No symptoms were observed on the control plants. C. siamense was reisolated from all inoculated samples, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose on E. japonica in China. The results further expand the range of plants that can be infected by C. siamense. This disease may decrease the value of plants and proper management strategies should be applied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, College of Agronomy, NO 1101, Zhimin Avenue, Economic and Technological Development District, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China, 330045; kwing23@126.com."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Weigang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; yelifang66@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Lifang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science and Technology Research Center of China Customs, Beijing, China; gaown2013@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenna", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, China, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China, 330045; jxaumj@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; zhanglianhu0328@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lianhu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, College of Agriculture in JiangXi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; xiongguihong2009@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Guihong", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, College of Agriculture, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; lbzjm0418@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Agricultural University, 91595, College of Agronomy, No. 1101, Zhimin Road, Nanchang Economic and Technological Development Zone, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China, 330045; cuiruqiang@jxau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Ruqiang", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36510422", "10.1094/PDIS-06-22-1341-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
