At a concentration higher than 3 mmol/L, eugenol was cytotoxic to oral mucosal fibroblasts in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Cell death was associated with intracellular depletion of glutathione (GSH). Most of the GSH was depleted prior to the onset of cell death. At concentrations of 3 mmol/L and 4 mmol/L, eugenol depleted about 45% and 77% of GSH after one-hour incubation. In addition, eugenol decreased cellular ATP level in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Eugenol also inhibited lipid peroxidation. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation was partially explained by its dose-dependent inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity. The IC50 of eugenol on xanthine oxidase activity was about 0.3 mmol/L. No DNA strand break activity for eugenol was found at concentrations between 0.5 and 3 mmol/L. Taken together, frequent exposure of oral mucosa to a high concentration of eugenol during the chewing of BQ might be involved in the pathogenesis of oral submucous fibrosis and oral cancer via its cytotoxicity. In contrast, eugenol at a concentration less than 1 mmol/L might protect cells from the genetic attack of reactive oxygen species via inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity and lipid peroxidation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, ROC."}], "LastName": "Jeng", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hahn", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "M Y", "Initials": "MY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dent Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0354343", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0345"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3T8H1794QW", "NameOfSubstance": "Eugenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Eugenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8006231", "10.1177/00220345940730050601"]}}]}
