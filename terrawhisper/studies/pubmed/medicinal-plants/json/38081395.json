The development of medicinal approaches to attenuate drug's toxicity represents an area of great concern in cancer research. Because research on this topic is still disputed and limited, we aim to investigate the potential of supplementation with Euphorbia grantii Oliv. on DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in Ehrlich carcinoma bearing mice.", "The high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of total methanolic extract (TE), and its bioactive dichloromethane fraction (DCMF) was applied for the determination of friedelin. Male BALB/c mice were used to keep the Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The experiment was performed for a 2-weeks period.", "A good linearity relationship was found to be with correlation coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) value of 0.9924 for the isolated friedelin. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) was found to be 0.00179, and 0.000537 ng/band respectively for friedelin. The amount of friedelin in the TE and DCMF were determined by using calibration curve of standard as 106.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.69\u00a0\u03bcg, and 159.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.24\u00a0\u03bcg friedelin/mg extract, respectively. DOX-induced cardiomyopathy by decreasing the ejection fraction (EF) compared to the Ehrlich and negative control groups. It resulted in a decrease in the EF by 30 and 39% compared to the other groups. High and low doses of the TE and DCMF did not result in significantly different ejection fractions compared to the Ehrlich group. Co-administration of DCMF with DOX ameliorated the alteration in the serum CKMB and LDH levels. As revealed from histopathological study, DOX impairs viability of cardiac myocytes and DCMF could effectively and extensively counteract this action of DOX and potentially protect the heart from severe toxicity of DOX.", "Finally, our results indicated that Euphorbia grantii Oliv. would be the best option to reduce DOX adverse effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
