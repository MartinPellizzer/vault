In the present work, the effect of dietary administration of fenugreek seeds on the glyoxalase system and antioxidant enzymes as well as levels of glutathione (GSH) have been examined in different tissues of mice. Swiss albino mice were fed with diet containing powdered fenugreek for 4 weeks. The mode and magnitude of effect was found to depend on the dose of fenugreek and type of tissue. The diet containing 1 and 2% of fenugreek enhanced the specific activity of gly I, whereas 5 and 10% inhibited its activity in the liver. However, on the other hand, the specific activity of gly II decreased continuously with dose. Dietary administration of fenugreek seeds resulted in an increase of GSH levels and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in the liver. Fenugreek (1 and 2%) showed no appreciable change in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. However, 5 and 10% doses of fenugreek supplementation inhibited their activities. In the case of spleen, a significant change in gly I was observed only at 10% fenugreek. In addition, a significant increase was also observed with GSH levels. Fenugreek treatment up to 5% showed a small but consistent increase in erythrocytes. In the case of GST, the activity enhanced with dose. Significant elevation of catalase activity was observed with a 10% dose of fenugreek. The significance and relevance of these findings are suggested in relation to mechanistic aspects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nuclear Science Centre, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chandra", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kale", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactoylglutathione Lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactoylglutathione Lyase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11524137", "10.1016/s0278-6915(01)00040-0", "S0278691501000400"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
