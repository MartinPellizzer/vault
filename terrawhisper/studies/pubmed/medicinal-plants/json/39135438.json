Merr. Fresh samples yielded higher essential oil (EO) (1.25%) than shade-dried ones. Increasing NaCl concentration correlated with higher EO yields, while a basic pH favoured superior yields. Gas Chromatography identified Eugenol and \u03b2-myrcene as primary constituents. Eugenol content peaked at 10% NaCl (56.429%) and was lowest at pH 4 (42.850%). \u03b2-myrcene content was highest at pH 4 (31.476%). Hydro distillation with systematic sampling evaluated the effects of 14 fractions in different time frames. Phenylpropanoids (mainly eugenol) and acyclic monoterpene (mainly \u03b2-myrcene) dominated all fractions, with cyclic monoterpene (mainly limonene) enriched in the first four fractions. Fractions 10 to 14 showed significant increases in eugenol compared to the control. These findings provide insights for meeting market demands, enhancing the commercial potential of <i>P. dioica</i> EO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Boduppal, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "A Niranjana", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Boduppal, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Venkatesh", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Boduppal, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Krishna Vamsi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8294-2234"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Boduppal, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "J Kotesh", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Boduppal, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Satya Srinivas", "ForeName": "K V N", "Initials": "KVN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Boduppal, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Babu", "ForeName": "G D Kiran", "Initials": "GDK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Ram Swaroop", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39135438", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2390607"]}}]}
