Then compatibility principle of TCMF was analysed with network efficiency (NE) and NE related parameters.", "The network approach was applied for studying compatibility principle of Jiawei Shengmai San on it's antimyocardial ischemia reperfusion injury action. The results indicated that rhizoma corydalis was the main herb in Jiawei Shengmai San, and in turn was radix ophiopogonois, radix salvia miltiorrhiza, radix ginseng and fructus schizandrae, radix ginseng and radix salvia was clustered first, and in turn was radix, Formule composed of ophiopogonois and fructus schizandrae. Formule composed of radix ginseng and radix salvia, and radix ophiopogonois and fructus schizandrae; radix ginseng, radix salvia miltiorrhiza and rhizoma corydalis was the most effective one among all the formulaes.
