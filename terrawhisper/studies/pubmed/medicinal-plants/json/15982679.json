These polyphenols have been classified according to the stage of oxidative structural transformation and oligomerization, into types I-IV and I+ to IV+, etc. Parallels were found between their oxidative transformations and plant evolution. They were also classified by the linkage units between the monomers, into DOG, GOD, GOG and DOGOD types (D=Diphenoyl, G=Galloyl, O=Oxygen), etc. Besides their fundamental activities, e.g., reduction and anti-peroxidation properties, remarkable biological and pharmacological activities of various potencies have also been found, including, amongst others, inhibition of lipid-peroxidation, mutagenicity of carcinogens and tumor promotion, host-mediated antitumor effects specific to particular tannin structures, antiviral activity and potentiation of antibacterial activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Okayama University, Tsushima, Okayama 700-8530, Japan. okudatakjp@ybb.ne.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okuda", "ForeName": "Takuo", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}], "NumberOfReferences": "182"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15982679", "10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.04.023", "S0031-9422(05)00185-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
