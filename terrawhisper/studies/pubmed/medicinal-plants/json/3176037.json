Para-fluorophenylalanine, griseofulvin, maleic hydrazide, lithium chloride, and cyclophosphamide all induced significant levels of hyperdiploidy in V. faba root tip cells. Lithium chloride and sodium azide were negative for hyperdiploidy induction. In addition to the numerical loss or gain in chromosome number, the chemicals induced other specific chromosomal effects, possibly indicating different mechanisms by which these chemicals bring about genomic imbalance. Judging from the lowest effective aneuploidy-inducing dose of each chemical, the V. faba root tip assay system appears to be a sensitive and promising tool for evaluating the potential of chemicals to induce aneuploidy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Toxicology Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711."}], "LastName": "Sandhu", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Acedo", "ForeName": "G N", "Initials": "GN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8602702", "ISSNLinking": "0748-2337"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aneuploidy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3176037", "10.1177/074823378800400207"]}}]}
