This geographical area has an old tradition of herbal healing. A total of 33 species have been documented through interactions with village elders, traditional doctors and herbalists. Of the 33 medicinal plant species surveyed in the Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas, six have not been previously reported, seven have received only minor phytochemical coverage in the literature, and the medicinal uses of seven other plants have not been corroborated with traditional medicinal reports from around the world. The traditional medicinal uses of six medicinal plants have been corroborated with previously published reports but their biological activities have yet to be confirmed in the laboratory. The medicinal uses of four other plants have been corroborated with previously published reports and their biological activities have been confirmed in the laboratory. The purported medicinal use of three plant species could not be confirmed in the laboratory."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, North Dartmouth, MA 02747-2300, USA. ghammond@umassd.edu"}], "LastName": "Hammond", "ForeName": "G B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "I D", "Initials": "ID"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Villegas", "ForeName": "L F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vaisberg", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1 R15 CA 56911-01A1", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peru"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9687078", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00009-9", "S0378874198000099"]}}]}
