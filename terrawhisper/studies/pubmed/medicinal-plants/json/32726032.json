After the SD rats were gavaged with the extract(136 g\u00b7kg~(-1), according to the crude drug dose), the metabolites in their feces were detected by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS~E technique, and the obtained mass spectrometry data was combined with UNIFI software for prediction. The prototype components and metabolites in rat feces were identified with reference materials and related literature. A total of 43 metabolites were identified(including 8 prototype components and 35 metabolites). The metabolic pathways mainly include monocaffeoylquinic acid(hydrogenation reduction, ring-opening cracking, sulfation, hydroxylation, glucuronidation), quercetin(O-C2 bond ring-opening cleavage, C2-C3 double bond reduction, rutin carbonylation) and so on. The metabolites and metabolic process of L. bulbifera extract in rat feces were clarified, which provided a basis for the study of the active substances and its mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList":
