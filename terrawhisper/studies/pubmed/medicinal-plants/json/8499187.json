But there is some faint hope in the research of Tanzanian traditional medicine. An almost 90-year-man, Waziri Mrisho, is credited with having treated AIDS patients successfully with herbs that strengthen the immune system. Margaret Nakamya was stricken by the symptoms of AIDs in March 1990. She was referred to Waziri and started using his herbs. 3 years later she weighs 49 kg compared to 40 kg before. The old man's son set up a little factory where he pulverizes herbs and sells them at the price he can command The 3 types of trees that the herbal medicine is taken from grow in the wild, but some have also been planted around the factory. Even if these herbs are effective, it will take years before the AIDS epidemic is over, when people have changed their lifestyles. The means of communication (TV, cinema, radio, telephone) are missing or inadequate. In the Kagera region, with 1.2 million inhabitants, 25% of pregnant women are HIV-infected and 65,000 children lost their parents to AIDS. There are 2000 children in Dar Es Salaam living in the streets. The Anglican St. Albans Church runs a center for street kids where they get meals 3 times a week. The nurse Ruth Nesje enlisted a Norwegian physician and homeopath in a research project involving 30 AIDS patients in Norway. The University in Bergen will do in vitro testing. One group of patients will receive both AZT and the herbs, another group will get only AZT, and the 3rd group will obtain only the herbs. The Norwegian Nursing Association, NORAD, and DANIDA also plan various projects in the Tanga region."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["093221", "00239257"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNALEN SYKEPLEIEN."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome--prevention and control", "Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Case Studies", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developed Countries", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Eastern Africa", "Economic Factors", "English Speaking Africa", "Europe", "Financial Activities", "Foreign Aid", "Health", "Health Services", "Hiv Infections--prevention and control", "Measurement", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Northern Europe", "Norway", "Plants, Medicinal", "Prevalence", "Scandinavia", "Studies", "Tanzania", "Treatment", "Viral Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "8499187", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "07", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["nor"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0802-9776", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "81", "Issue": "7", "PubDate": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "Apr", "Day": "20"}}, "Title": "Journalen sykepleien", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Sykepleien"}, "ArticleTitle": "[AIDS in Tanzania].", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "5", "EndPage": "11", "MedlinePgn": "5-11"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barstad", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "AIDS i Tanzania."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Norway", "MedlineTA": "J Sykepleien", "NlmUniqueID": "9008978", "ISSNLinking": "0802-9776"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Advocacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services, Indigenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tanzania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8499187"]}}]}
