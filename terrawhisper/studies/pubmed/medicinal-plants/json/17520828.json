Interestingly, the Flos Sesamum indicum L. was usually used to cure verruca vulgaris and verruca plana in folk of China, and showed a pleasant result. Previous chemical investigations of this plant mainly concentrate on its seeds, showed the presence of proteins and fat oils, herein we make a systematic chemical research on the dry flowers of this plant. Column chromatography including silica gel, C18 and Sephadex LH-20 were used to separate the chemical constituents and the structures were determined by chemical and spectroscopic methods. Ten compounds were isolated from the 95% ethanol extract of the plant and elucidated as latifonin (1), momor-cerebroside (2), soya-cerebroside II (3), 1-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(2S, 3S, 4R, 5E,9Z)-2-N-(2'-hydroxytetracosanoyl) 1,3,4-trihydroxy-5,9-octadienine (4), 1-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(2S, 3S, 4R, 8Z)-2-N-(2' R) 2'-hydroxytetracosanoyl) 3,4-dihydroxy-8-octadene (5), (2S, 1\" S) -aurantiamide acetate (6), benzyl alcohol-O-(2'-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl, 3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7), beta-sitosterol (8), daucosterol (9) and D-galacititol (10). Among them, 4 is a new compound, and others were isolated from the flowers of the plant for the first time. Compounds 2 to 4 belong to cerebroside, which is rare to be found in land plants and was proved to possess many bioactivities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yong-Mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Wen-Cai", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qi", "Initials": "ZQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Shou-Xun", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1-O-glucopyranosyl-2-N-(2'-hydroxytetracosanoyl)-1,3,4-trihydroxy-5,9-octadienine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cerebrosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycolipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sitosterols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "115074-93-6", "NameOfSubstance": "soya-cerebroside II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5LI01C78DD", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-sitosterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycolipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesamum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sitosterols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17520828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
