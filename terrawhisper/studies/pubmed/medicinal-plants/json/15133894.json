We have recently cloned the full-length cDNA for ECBP21. In this work, using recombinant ECBP21 we prepared rabbit antiserum with high specificity and high titer against ECBP21, and investigated the organ-specific distribution of ECBP21 in Angelica dahurica. ECBP21 was found in all organs examined, particularly abundant in the leaves flowers, and raches, and less in the roots. It was also found in all cells examined, and particularly enriched in the cell wall. These data support the notion that ECBP21 is specifically localized extracellularly, and imply that it may be involved in plant growth and development. In addition, using immunogold transmission electron microscopy method, we studied the subcellular localization of ECBP21 in rachis cells of Angelica dahurica. The results indicated that the ECBP21 was mainly localized in cell wall; this provided a direct evidence of the extracellular existence of ECBP21."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang 050016."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Cun Bao", "Initials": "CB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Guo Hong", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Da Ye", "Initials": "DY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "0413570", "ISSNLinking": "0001-5334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calmodulin-Binding Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Calmodulin-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Immunoelectron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15133894"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
