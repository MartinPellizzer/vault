MAP is composed of 250 amino acids having a combined molecular weight of 27,833 and contains 23 lysine residues and 7 arginine residues. The amino acid sequence of MAP has 24% homology with the Ricin D-A chain. To carry out systematic structure-function studies of MAP, we have accomplished the total synthesis of its gene. We designed a synthetic MAP gene containing 12 unique restriction sites that were on the average 65 base pairs apart. Thirty synthetic oligonucleotides were enzymatically joined to form DNA duplexes. These were strategically synthesized to have EcoRI and HindIII cohesive ends and were cloned in pUC19. Nine blocks of the synthetic fragments were assembled in pUC19 to form the MAP gene consisting of 759 base pairs. The correctness of the connecting reactions was confirmed by step-wise sequencing of each assembled fragment as well as the total gene. When expressed under control of the tac promoter in Escherichia coli, the synthetic gene gave a protein similar to the native MAP. This was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Life Science Research Laboratory, Japan Tobacco Inc., Kanagawa."}], "LastName": "Habuka", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murakami", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noma", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kudo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Horikoshi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["J04707"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligodeoxyribonucleotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "N-Glycosyl Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.2.22", "NameOfSubstance": "MAP protein, Mirabilis jalapa"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "N-Glycosyl Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligodeoxyribonucleotides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2708328", "S0021-9258(18)83474-3"]}}]}
