Key areas of investigation include alterations in microtubule proteins, androgen receptor and androgen receptor splice variant 7, ERG rearrangement, drug efflux mechanisms, cancer stem cells, centrosome clustering, upregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, enhanced DNA damage repair capability, and the involvement of neurotrophin receptor 1/protein kinase C.", "With \"Prostate cancer\", \"Docetaxel\", \"Docetaxel resistance\", \"Natural compounds\", \"Traditional Chinese medicine\", \"Traditional Chinese medicine compound\", \"Medicinal plants\" as the main keywords, PubMed, Web of Science and other online search engines were used for literature retrieval.", "Our findings underscore the intricate interplay of molecular alterations that collectively contribute to the resistance of PCa cells to DTX. Moreover, we highlight the potential of TCMs as a promising complementary therapy, showcasing their ability to counteract DTX resistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy.", "The integration of TCMs in PCa treatment emerges as an innovative approach with significant potential to overcome DTX resistance. This review not only provides insights into the mechanisms of resistance but also presents new prospects for improving the clinical outcomes of patients with PCa undergoing DTX therapy. The comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms lays the foundation for future research and the development of more effective therapeutic interventions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
