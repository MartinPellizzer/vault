They are recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Japanese Pharmacopeia, Korea Pharmacopeia, Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia of India and Flora of Thailand. There are 15-20 species of Pueraria in the world, including 7 species and 2 varieties in China. At present, there are 6 species with medicinal value, such as Pueraria lobata and P. thomsonii. The main chemical components of the genus are isoflavones, flavonoids, terpenes, steroids, coumarins, puerarin glycosides and benzopyrans. A total of 240 compounds have been isolated and identified from this genus, and their pharmacological effects mainly include improvement of the cardiovascular system, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-alcoholic and estrogen-like effects. In this study, chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of Pueraria at home and abroad were systematically summarized, in order to provide references for the material basis, quality control and further development of Pueraria genus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparations,Ministry of Education,Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wei-Feng", "Initials": "WF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparations,Ministry of Education,Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jia-Li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparations,Ministry of Education,Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xiao-Wei", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparations,Ministry of Education,Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pu-Zhao", "Initials": "PZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparations,Ministry of Education,Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wen-Ting", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine Preparations,Ministry of Education,Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Rong-Hua", "Initials": "RH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pueraria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33787127", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20201124.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
