In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), mulberry leaf is mainly used for anti-diabetic purpose due to its enrichment in bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids and polysaccharides. However, these components are variable due to the different habitats of the mulberry plant. Therefore, geographic origin is an important feature because it is closely associated with bioactive ingredient composition that further influences medicinal qualities and effects. As a low-cost and non-invasive method, surface enhanced Raman spectrometry (SERS) is able to generate the overall fingerprints of chemical compounds in medicinal plants, which holds the potential for the rapid identification of their geographic origins. In this study, we collected mulberry leaves from five representative provinces in China, namely, Anhui, Guangdong, Hebei, Henan and Jiangsu. SERS spectrometry was applied to characterize the fingerprints of both ethanol and water extracts of mulberry leaves, respectively. Through the combination of SERS spectra and machine learning algorithms, mulberry leaves were well discriminated with high accuracies in terms of their geographic origins, among which the deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) showed the best performance. Taken together, our study established a novel method for predicting the geographic origins of mulberry leaves through the combination of SERS spectra with machine learning algorithms, which strengthened the application potential of the method in the quality evaluation, control and assurance of mulberry leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Zhang-Wen", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Intelligent Medical Engineering, School of Medical Informatics and Engineering, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jia-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicines, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qing-Hua", "Initials": "QH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First School of Clinical Medicine, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Mou", "ForeName": "Jing-Yi", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medical Imaging, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chang-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Dao-Quan", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5339-7484"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory Medicine, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Morus alba"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "49"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36803175", "10.1080/07391102.2023.2180433"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
