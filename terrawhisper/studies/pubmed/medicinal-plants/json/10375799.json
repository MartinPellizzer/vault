The parameters erythrocyte stiffness (ES) and relaxation time (RT), the blood plasma viscosity (eta), the plasma fibrinogen concentration (Cf) and the blood sedimentation rate (BSR), the PFWD, and maximal walking distance (MWD) were determined at 6 wk before treatment (-6), at the beginning of the treatment (0), and after 6, 11, 16, and 48 wk of treatment.", "At wk -6, ES and RT of both the ND- and D-group were not significantly different from a healthy control group. At wk 0, stiffness and RT were significantly higher than healthy control, and the mean PFWD was only 111 m. The eta value was significantly elevated and Cf and BSR were enhanced. Throughout 11 wk of treatment ES, RT, eta, and Cf decreased gradually and PFWD improved. Between 16 and 48 wk, ES, and RT were no longer significantly different from the controls, whereas eta and Cf decreased gradually but remained higher than normal, BSR decreased, and the PFWD improved by a factor of 3.8 times (D) and 3.3 times (ND).", "GbE gives therapeutic effects in PAOD patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Cell Biophysics and Bioengineering, Aachen University of Applied Sciences, J\u00fclich, Germany."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Y D", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Landsmann", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schanowski-Bouvier", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dikta", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Artmann", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8100330", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9756"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9001-32-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Arterial Occlusive Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Sedimentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Viscosity"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Angiopathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Deformability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Walking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10375799"]}}]}
