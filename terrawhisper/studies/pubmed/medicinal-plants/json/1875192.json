The symptoms induced in cowpea by TpM-34 and TpM-341 differed. TpM-34 gave rise to chlorotic lesions which expanded with time, often becoming confluent with adjacent lesions, and developed necrotic margins; the plants became systemically infected. TpM-341 induced necrotic lesions which, once developed, did not expand further; plants did not become systemically infected. Analysis of pseudorecombinants formed between the RNAs of TpM-34 and TpM-341 showed that RNA 2 determined the difference in symptoms. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the P2 movement proteins of the two isolates revealed only one difference, a deletion of an A residue in a sequence of four A residues (nucleotides 790 to 793). Construction of full-length TpM-34 and TpM-341 RNA 2 cDNA clones, from which infectious RNA 2 could be transcribed in vitro, and in vitro mutagenesis of a cDNA clone of TpM-341, confirmed that the difference in the symptoms induced by TpM-341 was caused by the loss of this A residue. This single base deletion was predicted to cause a translational frame-shift in the P2 ORF causing the loss of 88 amino acids at the C terminus which were replaced by a sequence of 34 different amino acids, producing a truncated P2 protein. In vitro translation of RNA 2 transcribed from cDNA clones showed that RNA with four or three A residues starting at nucleotide 790 produced proteins of Mr 36K and 30K respectively, in agreement with the predictions based on the nucleotide sequence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, U.K."}], "LastName": "Osman", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ingles", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buck", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Agar Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1875192", "10.1099/0022-1317-72-8-1793"]}}]}
