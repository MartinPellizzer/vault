Malate has been used as a preferred source of carbon for the enrichment and isolation <i>Azospirillum</i> spp., but the genes involved in their transport and utilization are not yet characterized. In this study, we investigated the role of the two types of dicarboxylate transporters (DctP and DctA) of <i>A. brasilense</i> in their ability to colonize and promote growth of the roots of a C4 grass. We found that DctP protein was distinctly upregulated in <i>A. brasilense</i> grown with malate as sole carbon source. Inactivation of <i>dctP</i> in <i>A. brasilense</i> led to a drastic reduction in its ability to grow on dicarboxylates and form cell aggregates. Inactivation of <i>dctA</i>, however, showed a marginal reduction in growth and flocculation. The growth and nitrogen fixation of a <i>dctP</i> and <i>dctA</i> double mutant of <i>A. brasilense</i> were severely compromised. We have shown here that DctPQM and DctA transporters play a major and a minor role in the transport of C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates in <i>A. brasilense</i>, respectively. Studies on inoculation of the seedlings of a C4 grass, <i>Eleusine corcana</i>, with <i>A. brasilense</i> and its dicarboxylate transport mutants revealed that dicarboxylate transporters are required by <i>A. brasilense</i> for an efficient colonization of plant roots and their growth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 School of Biotechnology, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221005, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Vijay Shankar", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 School of Biotechnology, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221005, India."}], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Prajna", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 School of Biotechnology, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221005, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Parul", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Division of Biotechnology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Durgesh Narain", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Division of Biotechnology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, India."}], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "Basant Kumar", "Initials": "BK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 School of Biotechnology, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221005, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Chhaya", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Botany, Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (PG) College (Affiliated to CSJM University, Kanpur), Civil Lines, Kanpur-208001, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Surendra Pratap", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Dr D Y Patil Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Institute, Dr D.
