As a result of questionnaires and interviews, food intakes for three consecutive days were collected. Intakes of cereals, pulses, roots and tubers, and sugar and jaggery, by both farming and non-farming females were significantly lower than the prescribed Indian recommended dietary intakes (RDI). The consumption of milk and milk products and fats and oils was adequate whereas green leafy vegetables and fruits were the most limited food items. No significant overall differences were observed between females from farming and non-farming backgrounds. Level of education did not show significant influence on intakes of different food items. The consumption of fruits and green leafy vegetables increased with the increase in family monthly income. There is a pressing need to educate rural pregnant women regarding their increased nutritional requirements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Foods and Nutrition, CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Panwar", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Punia", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10616667", "10.3109/09637489809086418"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
