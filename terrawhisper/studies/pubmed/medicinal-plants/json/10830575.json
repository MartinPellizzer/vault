One hundred and ninety-four patients with stomach cancer registered at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), Trivandrum, Kerala, India, during the period 1988-1991 were considered as cases. A minimum of one control (n = 305), matched for age (+/- 5 years), sex, religion and residential area was selected from the visitors to RCC during the same period. Interviews were carried out using a predetermined structured food frequency questionnaire. The information collected also included socio-demographic/economic background, tobacco chewing, tobacco smoking and alcohol habits. Data were analysed using a multiple logistic regression model. Odds ratios for all dietary variables were estimated. Increased risks were observed with higher consumption of rice (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.6-10.0). Risk was high for those consuming spicy food (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.1-5.0), high consumption of chilli (OR 7.4; 95% CI 4.0-13.5) and consumption of high-temperature food (OR 7.0; 95% CI 3.7-12.9). On multivariate analysis, high consumption of rice, high consumption of chilli and consumption of high-temperature food were found to be independent risk factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College PO, Trivandrum, Kerala, India. rajanrcc@techpark.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gangadharan", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Varghese", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cancer Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "9300837", "ISSNLinking": "0959-8278"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Confidence Intervals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10830575", "10.1097/00008469-200004000-00004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
