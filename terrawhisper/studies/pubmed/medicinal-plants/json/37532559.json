Although current medications using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective and well-tolerated for treating patients with chronic HCV, high prices and the existence of DAA-resistant variants hamper treatment. There is thus a need for easily accessible antivirals with different mechanisms of action. During the screening of Indonesian medicinal plants for anti-HCV activity, we found that a crude extract of Dryobalanops aromatica leaves possessed strong antiviral activity against HCV. Bioassay-guided purification identified an oligostilbene, vaticanol B, as an active compound responsible for the anti-HCV activity. Vaticanol B inhibited HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner with 50% effective and cytotoxic concentrations of 3.6 and 559.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively (Selectivity Index: 155.4). A time-of-addition study revealed that the infectivity of HCV virions was largely lost upon vaticanol B pretreatment. Also, the addition of vaticanol B following viral entry slightly but significantly suppressed HCV replication and HCV protein expression in HCV-infected and a subgenomic HCV replicon cells. Thus, the results clearly demonstrated that vaticanol B acted mainly on the viral entry step, while acting weakly on the post-entry step as well. Furthermore, co-treatment of the HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir with vaticanol B increased the anti-HCV effect. Collectively, the present study has identified a plant-derived oligostilbene, vaticanol B, as a novel anti-HCV compound."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JST/JICA SATREPS, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences."}], "LastName": "Aoki-Utsubo", "ForeName": "Chie", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chemistry, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN)."}], "LastName": "Hanafi", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JST/JICA SATREPS, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Armanti", "ForeName": "Destia Tri", "Initials": "DT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsukuba Division, Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health, and Nutrition."}], "LastName": "Fuchino", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsukuba Division, Research Center for Medicinal Plant Resources, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health, and Nutrition."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Kochi Prefectural Makino Botanical Garden."}], "LastName": "Kawahara", "ForeName": "Nobuo", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chemistry, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN)."}], "LastName": "Hartati", "ForeName": "Sri", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Natural Products Medicine Research and Development, Institute of Tropical Disease, Airlangga University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Airlangga University."}], "LastName": "Widyawaruyanti", "ForeName": "Aty", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Sudarmono", "ForeName": "Pratiwi", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences."}], "LastName": "Kameoka", "ForeName": "Masanori", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Kobe University Graduate School of Health Sciences."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Konan Women's University."}], "LastName": "Hotta", "ForeName": "Hak", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vaticanol B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hepacivirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dipterocarpaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis C, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37532559", "10.1248/bpb.b23-00086"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
