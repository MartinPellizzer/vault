This study investigated antioxidant and anxiolytic activities of its leaves aqueous extract on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. Rats (36) were randomly divided into six groups and received (20 days) distilled water, 10\u00a0mL/kg; Moringa oleifera leaf-aqueous extract (25, 50, and 100\u00a0mg/kg) or Loperamide (5\u00a0mg/kg). On days 1, 8, 17, and 20, behavioral parameters were evaluated. Colitis was induced (day 15, except in normal group) through acetic acid (4%, 1\u00a0mL) intra-rectal administration. After sacrifice (day 21), lesion number, weight/length ratio of the colon were recorded. Oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated. On day 20, Moringa oleifera (100\u00a0mg/kg) reduced the number of head dipping and the duration in opened arms, respectively 2.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 and 5.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0s against 14.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72 and 2.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48\u00a0s in the control. It decreased colon weight/length ratio: 112.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.46 against 185.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.28\u00a0mg/cm in the control; malondialdehyde level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and nitric oxide concentration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), in the brain: respectively 25.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60 and 36.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.19 against 34.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33 and 46.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.25\u00a0\u00b5mol/mg of tissue in the control. In the serum, the extract (50\u00a0mg/kg) significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased the catalase activity (0.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00 against 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00\u00a0\u00b5mol/mg of protein in the negative control group). At 100\u00a0mg/kg, it increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) reduced glutathione concentration to 5.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31 against 3.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0\u00b5mol/mg of protein in the negative control group. The improvement on colitis pathophysiology, the antioxidant and the anxiolytic effects noted therefore suggest that Moringa oleifera can be a potential source of drugs alleviating anxiety and oxidative stress associated to ulcerative colitis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
