Seed morphometric and dispersal kinetics of the critically endangered Dioscorea strydomiana were measured and compared with those of four other Dioscorea species, and seed germination response under constant temperatures (5-35\u00a0\u00b0C) was compared with that of the congeneric and widespread D.\u00a0sylvatica. Seed mass of D.\u00a0strydomiana (ca. 14\u00a0mg) was twice that of D.\u00a0sylvatica, but similar to or smaller than the other species examined. Seeds of D.\u00a0strydomiana have the lowest speed of descent and lowest variability in most of the morphological traits considered, suggesting lower phenotypic plasticity but higher variance in the wing-loading value. Seeds of D.\u00a0strydomiana reached maximum germination at 15\u00a0\u00b0C (ca. 47%), which decreased slightly to ca. 37% at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and was completely inhibited at 35\u00a0\u00b0C. D.\u00a0sylvatica seeds started to germinate at 10\u00a0\u00b0C (ca. 3%), reached 75-80% germination at 15-20\u00a0\u00b0C and maximum (ca. 90%) at 25-30\u00a0\u00b0C. Base temperatures for germination (T<sub>b</sub> ) were 9.3 and 5.7\u00a0\u00b0C, for D.\u00a0strydomiana and D.\u00a0sylvatica, respectively. Due to the higher germination percentages of D.\u00a0sylvatica, ceiling and optimum temperatures could also be modelled for this species, suggesting higher sensitivity to high temperature for seeds of D.\u00a0strydomiana. The detected poor seed lot quality of D.\u00a0strydomiana suggests difficulties in reproduction from seed, highlighting the need for further investigation and conservation actions for this threatened yam species."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6235-4603"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Capital and Plant Health Department, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Ardingly, UK."}], "LastName": "Mattana", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Capital and Plant Health Department, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Ardingly, UK."}], "LastName": "Gomez-Barreiro", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency, Lydenburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "L\u00f6tter", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South African National Biodiversity Institute, Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden, Wilropark, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Hankey", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South African National Biodiversity Institute, Lowveld National Botanical Garden, Mbombela, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Froneman", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South African National Biodiversity Institute, Lowveld National Botanical Garden, Mbombela, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mamatsharaga", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Capital and Plant Health Department, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Ardingly, UK."}], "LastName": "Wilkin", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Capital and Plant Health Department, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Ardingly, UK."}], "LastName": "Ulian", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "MGU", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dioscorea"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30076674", "10.1111/plb.12887"]}}]}
