The data were collected through structured questionnaire in Persian. All plant species recorded for the treatment of diabetes mellitus were sampled. Samples were identified by a botanist and obtained a voucher specimens number and deposited in the Shiraz School of Pharmacy Herbarium. The information such as scientific name, family, local name, medicinal use(s), parts used and preparation method were provided. Literature review on available data about antidiabetic effect of the addressed plant species was done to highlight gaps in current knowledge and propose the next steps.", "In total, 50 informants were interviewed. Totally 39 plant species were recommended by herbal healers, of which 28 are native to Iran. The most recommended plants for diabetes were Trigonella foenum-graecam (28 Attars), Securigera securidaca (22 Attars), Vaccinium arctostaphylos (18 Attars). The most abundant families were Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae and Apiaceae. Plant parts used were mainly seeds, flowers, leaves and fruits. The most usual preparation methods were decoction, powder and distillation. Around 44% of all reported plants for diabetes are also in use for obesity management", "This study provided ethnopharmacological knowledge from Fars region in Iran for a specific disease and we have introduced important plant species which are recommended by local herbal healers for diabetes mellitus. For 23% of reported plants, clinical studies approved antidiabetic properties and for 61%, animal studies approved antidiabetic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
