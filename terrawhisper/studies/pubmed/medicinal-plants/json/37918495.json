As compared with microfluidics, the nanoparticles prepared by emulsification method exhibited a smaller size, higher encapsulation efficiency, higher drug loading and lower viscosity for injection. Subsequently, a rat myocardial ischemia (MI) was established using male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (250\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0g) subcutaneously injected with 85\u00a0mg/kg isoproterenol (ISO) for two consecutive days. The pharmacokinetic findings demonstrated that our SCU-PAE PLGA NPs exhibited prolonged blood circulation time in MI rats, leading to increased levels of SCU and PAE in the heart. This resulted in significant improvements in electrocardiogram and cardiac index, as well as reduced serum levels of CK, LDH, AST. Histopathological analysis using H&E and TUNEL staining provided further evidence of improved cardiac function and decreased apoptosis. Additionally, experiments measuring SOD, MDA, GSH, NO, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels indicated that SCU-PAE PLGA NPs may effectively treat MI through oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, thereby establishing it as a promising therapeutic intervention."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
