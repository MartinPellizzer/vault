In the present study, xyloglucan was subjected in vitro to partial, non-enzymic scission by treatment with ascorbate plus H(2)O(2), which together generate -*OH. The partially degraded xyloglucan appeared to contain ester bonds within the backbone, as indicated by an irreversible decrease in viscosity upon alkaline hydrolysis. Aldehyde and/or ketone groups were also introduced into the polysaccharide by -*OH-attack, as indicated by staining with aniline hydrogen-phthalate and by reaction with NaB(3)H(4). The introduction of ester and oxo groups supports the proposed sequence of reactions: (a) -*OH-mediated H-abstraction to produce a carbon-centred carbohydrate radical; (b) reaction of the latter with O(2); and (c) elimination of a hydroperoxyl radical (HO(2)*-). When the partially degraded xyloglucan was reduced with NaB(3)H(4) followed by acid hydrolysis, several 3H-aldoses were detected ([3H]galactose, [3H]xylose, [3H]glucose, [3H]ribose and probably [3H]mannose), in addition to unidentified 3H-products (probably including anhydroaldoses). 3H-Alditols were undetectable, showing that few or no conventional reducing termini were introduced. Digestion of the NaB(3)H(4)-reduced, partially degraded xyloglucan with Driselase released 25 times more [3H]Xyl-alpha-(1-->6)-Glc than Xyl-alpha-(1-->6)-[3H]Glc, suggesting that the xylose side-chains of the xyloglucan had been more heavily attacked by -*OH than the glucose residues of the backbone. The radioactive xyloglucan was readily digested by cellulase, yielding 3H-products in the hepta- to nonasaccharide range. A fingerprinting strategy for identifying -*OH-attacked xyloglucan in plant cell walls is proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Edinburgh Cell Wall Group, Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, The University of Edinburgh, Daniel Rutherford Building, The King's Buildings, Mayfield Road, EH9 3JH, Edinburgh, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fry", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Carbohydr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0043535", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6215"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Borohydrides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligodeoxyribonucleotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10028-17-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tritium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "681HV46001", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "87L0B9CPPA", "NameOfSubstance": "sodium borohydride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A1TA934AKO", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PHA4727WTP", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X2RN3Q8DNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Borohydrides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Galactose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mannose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oligodeoxyribonucleotides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ribose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tritium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xylose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11438096", "10.1016/s0008-6215(01)00110-0", "S0008621501001100"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
