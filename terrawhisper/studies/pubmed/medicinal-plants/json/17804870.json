The main focus is on pharmacogenomics of natural products derived from Kampo medicinal plants, with special emphasis on cancer treatment. One of these natural products with profound cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines is shikonin from the medicinal plant Lithospermum erythrorhizon. This compound has been selected to demonstrate how molecular determinants of response of tumor cells to Kampo-derived natural products can be investigated by microarray-based approaches. Synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives of natural products from Kampo medicine may lead to novel drugs with improved features for cancer treatment. Kampo-derived natural products represent a valuable reservoir for individual tumour treatment strategies in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Toxicology and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. t.efferth@dkfz.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Efferth", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miyachi", "ForeName": "Hayato", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartsch", "ForeName": "Helmut", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Genomics Proteomics", "NlmUniqueID": "101188791", "ISSNLinking": "1109-6535"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacogenetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}], "NumberOfReferences": "46"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17804870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
