The interventional group received Compound Honey Syrup (CHS), consisting of combination of honey and extracts of five medicinal plants (i.e., ginger, cinnamon, saffron, cardamom, and galangal) and the control group received a placebo.

Meanwhile the findings of SGRQ questionnaire were significantly different between the interventional and control groups at other times (P=0.001).
