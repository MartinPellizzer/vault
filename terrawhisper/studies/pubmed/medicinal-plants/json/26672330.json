Then using SPSS software to analyze its relevance.", "Significant difference of pseudostellarin B content was found in samples from different provinces, which was not detected in the sample of Fujian Province, but the difference of polysaccharides content was small, at around 30%. Basic nutrients and inorganic elements from the soil for comparison, Pseudostellaria heterophylla from different habitats and cultivation of soil nutrients and inorganic elements contents were very uneven. The contents of Pb, Cu and B in the soil sample of Guizhou Province were the highest, and Cr and available phosphorus content in the soil sample of Shandong Province, Zn and effective potassium in the soil sample of Fujian Province all were the highest. With reference to the Soil Environment Quality Standard (GB15618-1995), most of Pseudostellaria heterophylla soil reached the national standard. From the point of soil elements and medicinal materials quality correlation, pseudostellarin B content and polysaccharide content had no significant correlation between each element in the soil.", "The ammonium nitrogen, effective potassium, available phosphorus and elements of Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn and B in the soil have no direct effect on effective component content of medicinal materials. 60% of Pseudostellaria heterophylla origin is generally lack of B in soil. It should be appropriate to increase the percentage of boron in the fertilizer management to ensure the quality of Pseudostellaria heterophylla root."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-hong", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pseudostellarin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26672330"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
