Over the past two decades, the functionality of WRKY proteins has been the subject of extensive research in over 50 plant species, with a strong focus on their roles in responding to various stresses. Despite this extensive research, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive studies aimed at understanding how specific WRKY genes directly influence the timing of flowering and fruit development. This review offers an up-to-date look at WRKY family genes and provides insights into the key genes of WRKY to control flowering, enhance fruit ripening and secondary metabolism synthesis, and maintain fruit quality of various plants, including annuals, perennials, medicinal, and crop plants. The WRKY transcription factors serve as critical regulators within the transcriptional regulatory network, playing a crucial role in the precise enhancement of flowering processes. It is also involved in the up-regulation of fruit ripening was strongly demonstrated by combined transcriptomics and metabolomic investigation. Therefore, we speculated that the WRKY family is known to be a key regulator of flowering and fruiting in plants. This detailed insight will enable the identification of the series of molecular occurrences featuring WRKY proteins throughout the stages of flowering and fruiting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
