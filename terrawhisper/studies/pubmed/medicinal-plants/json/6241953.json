Data on the nature and frequency of obstetric and gynaecological complaints, patterns of consultations and preferences for the type of practitioner, Western or traditional, were collected from housewives. The nature, range and extent of expertise possessed by traditional practitioners were also assessed. The results indicate that reliance on traditional medicine is rapidly declining in favour of Western medicine. This seems to be due to urbanisation, increased acceptance of Western values and a lack of availability of traditional practitioners in sufficient numbers. However, self-administration of herbal remedies was still common, especially in rural areas, and might even be on the increase. The practitioners treated a variety of obstetric and gynaecological complaints using 60 plant species which were collected and identified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Y N", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikahihifo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Panuve", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Slatter", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Back Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fractures, Bone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Genital Diseases, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Midwifery"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Obstetric Labor Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tonga"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urologic Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6241953", "10.1016/0378-8741(84)90060-6", "0378-8741(84)90060-6"]}}]}
