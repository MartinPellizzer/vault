Legumes, whose N metabolism is particularly intricate, possess a unique type of GDH. This study presents an analysis of a legume-type GDH (isoform 2) from Medicago truncatula (MtGDH2). We measured MtGDH2 activity in both the Glu\u202f\u2192\u202f2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and 2OG\u202f\u2192\u202fGlu reaction directions and obtained kinetic parameters for Glu, 2OG, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and NADH. Inhibition assays revealed that compounds possessing di- or tricarboxylates act as inhibitors of plant GDHs. Interestingly, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate (PYR) weakly inhibits MtGDH2 compared to Arabidopsis thaliana homologs. Furthermore, we explored tetrazole derivatives to discover 3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (TBA) as an MtGDH2 inhibitor. The kinetic experiments are supported by six crystal structures, solved as: (i) unliganded enzyme, (ii) trapping the reaction intermediate 2-amino-2-hydroxyglutarate and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and also complexed with NAD<sup>+</sup> and inhibitors such as (iii) citrate, (iv) PYR, (v) isophthalate, and (vi) TBA. The complex with TBA revealed a new mode of action that, in contrast to other inhibitors, prevents domain closure. This discovery points to TBA as a starting point for the development of novel GDH inhibitors to study the functions of GDH in plants and potentially boost biomass production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
