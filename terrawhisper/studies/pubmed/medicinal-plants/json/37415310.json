In this study, a high-throughput analytical method for identifying the chemical composition of Yuquan capsules was established for the first time by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. The data obtained were subjected to fragment analysis and this was combined with UNIFI processing of natural products. One-hundred sixteen compounds were characterized from Yuquan capsules. Twelve of the bioactive compounds were quantitatively analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. This study was undertaken to obtain a comprehensive chemical profile analysis as well as to evaluate the overall quality of Yuquan capsules. The results will provide a reference for the quality evaluation of different Yuquan preparations. In addition, the data will enable basic pharmacodynamic research into these extensively used capsules."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2149-6258"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for the Development of Southwestern Endangered, Medicinal Materials, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning, P.
