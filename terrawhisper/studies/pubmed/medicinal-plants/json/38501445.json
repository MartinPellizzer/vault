However, the use of propaquizafop, including its safe use methods, residue patterns, dietary risk assessment, and maximum residue limits, for ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, has not been studied. An analytical method was established for the simultaneous determination of propaquizafop and its four metabolites in ginseng soil, fresh ginseng, ginseng plant, and dried ginseng using HPLC-MS/MS. This approach showed good linearity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> ranging from 0.9827 to 0.9999) and limit of quantification ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg. The intra- and interday recovery rates of this method ranged from 71.6 to 107.1% with relative standard deviation ranging from 1.3 to 23.2%. The method was applied to detect residual samples in the field, and it was found that the degradation of propaquizafop in ginseng plants and soil followed a first-order kinetic equation. <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> was between 0.8913 and 0.9666, and the half-life (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>) ranged from 5.04 to 8.05 days, indicating that it was an easily degradable pesticide (<i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub> < 30 days). The final propaquizafop residues in ginseng soil, plants, fresh ginseng, and dried ginseng ranged from 0.017 to 0.691 mg/kg. A dietary risk assessment was conducted on the final propaquizafop residue in fresh and dried ginseng. The results showed that the chronic exposure risk quotient values were less than 100% for fresh and dried ginseng (1.15% for fresh ginseng and 1.13% for dried ginseng). This illustrates that the dietary risk associated with the use of 10% propaquizafop emulsifiable concentrate in ginseng is very low. Thus, applying 750 mL/ha of propaquizafop on ginseng could not pose an unacceptable risk to public health. The results of the present study support the registration of propaquizafop in ginseng."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Zhijia", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Tengda", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qingyi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Mingxia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qinghui", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jingbo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yahe", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5064-5611"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Zhiguang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Zhongbin", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38501445", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c07832"]}}]}
