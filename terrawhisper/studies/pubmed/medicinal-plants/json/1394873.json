To investigate energy metabolism during VF, phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetization transfer were applied to isolated perfused ferret hearts. VF was induced either by perfusion with digitalis (strophanthidin, 30 microM) or by high-frequency electrical stimulation. We measured the flux in two critical reactions: from inorganic phosphate (Pi) to ATP (ATP synthesis rate) and from phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP (energy transfer capacity). During digitalis-induced VF, energy-related phosphates showed changes similar to those during hypoxia: myocardial [Pi] increased and [PCr] decreased. Concomitantly, the ATP synthesis rate increased to levels about threefold higher than control, whereas oxygen consumption increased by only 16%. The ATP synthesis rate exhibited a strong negative correlation with left ventricular pressure during VF (r = -0.95, n = 5, p < 0.02), whereas oxygen consumption did not (r = 0.19, p > 0.05). On the other hand, energy transfer capacity catalyzed by creatine kinase was significantly smaller during VF than in the control condition but still higher than the simultaneous ATP synthesis rate. In contrast to the marked energetic deterioration during VF induced by digitalis, electrically induced VF led to only a small increase in [Pi] and a small decrease in [PCr], and there were no significant changes in the ATP synthesis rate, energy transfer capacity, or O2 consumption. These results indicate that the rundown in energy metabolism during VF induced by digitalis was mainly attributable to a limitation of energy production through oxidative phosphorylation as well as to a marked increase in energy consumption. In contrast, myocardial energy generation remained unimpaired during VF induced by electrical stimulation. Intracellular calcium overload is more severe during VF induced by digitalis than during electrically induced VF (Circ Res 1991;68:1378-1389); severe calcium overload would be expected to compromise the capacity for energy generation by mitochondria. Thus, we propose that known differences in cellular calcium loading underlie the discrepant energetic patterns of the two types of VF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205."}], "LastName": "Kusuoka", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chacko", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marban", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 HL-44065", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Circ Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0047103", "ISSNLinking": "0009-7330"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Circ Res 1993 Jan;72(1):237"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferrets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Cardiovascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Fibrillation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1394873", "10.1161/01.res.71.5.1111"]}}]}
