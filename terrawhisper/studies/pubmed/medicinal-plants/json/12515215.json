A mouse endotoxeamia induced by lipopolysaccharide was also used. Splenocyte proliferation was quantified with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetery. NO2- concentration was examined by a Griess reagent and interleukin-1 activity was evaluated in thymocyte proliferation.", "HJD significantly inhibited the leukocyte infiltration and PGE2 production in the mouse air-pouch model. In the in vitro assay, HJD significantly inhibited concanavalin A(Con A)-induced transformation of spleen cells isolated from the endotoxeamia mice, but did not influence that from the normal mice. HJD did not affact Con A-induced interleukin-2 production in splenocytes in either normal or endotoxeamia mice. HJD remarkably reduced interleukin-1 and NO production in peritoneal macrophages elicited by lipopol ysaccharide.", "HJD displays an anti-inflammatory effect mainly through inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, NO and PGE2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology for Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12515215"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
