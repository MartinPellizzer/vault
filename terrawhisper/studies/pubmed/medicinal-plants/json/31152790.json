However, DH is also notorious for its intoxicating effects and there is currently a dearth of study of possible effects of DH on liver and placental tissues and hence its safe consumption warrants in-depth investigation. This study was therefore designed to investigate into the effect of DH on liver and placenta of pregnant rat via histopathological examination. Thirty pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups consisting of a control (distilled water) and four DH aqueous extract groups (250, 500, 1000 and 2000\u202fmg/kg body weight). The extracts were administered via oral gavage daily throughout the study and animals were sacrificed on day 21. Paraffin-embedded, hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of placenta and liver were examined. Significant changes (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were observed on relative liver and placental weights of animals treated with 2000\u202fmg/kg body weight DH extract. The placental numbers were decreased with the increased of DH extract concentration. Liver histological examination in all treated groups showed that tissues underwent degeneration characterized by hepatocyte swelling, cytoplasmic vacuolation, cytolysis, margination and clumping of nucleus chromatin. Changes of the basal and labyrinth zone were observed in placental tissues in all treated groups. Glycogen cells were reduced with fibrin deposition in the basal zone, while irregular vessel formation was demonstrated in the labyrinth zone. UHPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed the presence four steroidal saponins DH. In conclusion, DH aqueous extract exert hepatotoxicity and adverse effects on the placenta of rats. However, the underlying mechanism and phytochemicals inducing the observed toxicity require further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
