In Experiment 1, starting at six weeks of age, 65 rats were injected with DMH or saline alone once a week for four weeks. Rats in Groups 1 and 2 were fed diets containing 1% ginseng for five weeks, starting one week before the first dose of DMH. Animals in Groups 3 and 4 received ginseng for eight weeks after DMH treatment; Group 5 served as a carcinogen control group. In Experiment 2, 60 rats were injected with DMH or saline alone four times at one-week intervals. They were also fed diets containing 1% ginseng or the control diet throughout the 30 days of the experiment. In Experiment 1, numbers of foci with at least four crypts were significantly reduced in Group 2 treated with red ginseng during the initiation phase (p < 0.005). In Experiment 2, treatment with red ginseng also resulted in a decrease in the total number of DMH-induced ACF accompanied by a reduction in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling indexes in colonic crypts comprising ACF (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively). These findings suggest that dietary administration of red ginseng in combination with DMH suppresses colon carcinogenesis of rats, and the inhibition may be associated, in part, with suppression of cell proliferation in the colonic mucosa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wanibuchi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salim", "ForeName": "E I", "Initials": "EI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishino", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukushima", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "G34N38R2N1", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromodeoxyuridine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IX068S9745", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2-Dimethylhydrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1,2-Dimethylhydrazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bromodeoxyuridine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10798218", "10.1207/S15327914NC3601_10"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
