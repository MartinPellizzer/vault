The effects of calcium channel blockers have been confirmed in decreasing of oxidative stress. In the current study, the effects of amlodipine (AM), as a calcium channel blocker, were evaluated on oxidative damages induced by diazinon (DZN) in hippocampus tissue of Wistar rats. Forty-two rats were divided into six groups and treated intraperitoneally for two weeks. Group 1 served as control received vehicle, group 2 was treated with 9 mg/kg of AM, group 3 (positive control) received DZN (32 mg/kg), Groups 4, 5, and 6 were treated with 3, 6, and 9 mg/kg of AM adjunct with DZN (32 mg/kg), respectively. After 14 days, all the animals were sacrificed under anesthesia and hippocampus tissue and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis and histopathology experiments. The results showed that DZN caused significant increase in lipid peroxidation (<i>P</i> < 0.001), nitric oxide (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (<i>P</i> < 0.001) levels, depletion of total antioxidant capacity (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and structural changes in hippocampus tissues. Following AM administration, a significant improvement was observed in oxidative biomarkers in hippocampus tissues. Additionally, our biochemical findings were related well with histopathological examinations. In conclusion, the data of this study indicated that AM administration may prevent oxidative damages via improving of energy production and preventing of free radical formation in DZN-exposed animals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, I.R.
