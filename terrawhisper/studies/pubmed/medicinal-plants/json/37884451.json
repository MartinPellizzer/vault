Its effectiveness against clinical isolates of Candida species and its synergistic effect with conventional antifungal drugs were assessed, and its molecular mechanism of action was further studied against Candida albicans.", "A newly isolated strain from Tunisian soil, S. blastmyceticus S108, showed significant antifungal activity against Candida species by well diffusion method. The butanolic extract of S108 strain supernatant exhibited the best anti-Candida activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 250\u00a0\u03bcg ml-1, determined by the microdilution method. The bio-guided purification steps of the butanolic extract were performed by chromatographic techniques. Among the fractions obtained, F13 demonstrated the highest level of activity, displaying a MIC of 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg ml-1. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses of this fraction (F13) revealed the glycolipidic nature of the active molecule with a molecular weight of 685.6 m/z. This antifungal metabolite remained stable to physicochemical changes and did not show hemolytic activity even at 4MIC corresponding to 125\u00a0\u00b5g ml-1 toward human erythrocytes. Besides, the glycolipid compound was combined with 5-flucytosine and showed a high synergistic effect with a fractional inhibitory concentration index value 0.14 against C. albicans ATCC 10231. This combination resulted in a decrease of MIC values of 5-flucytosine and the glycolipid-like compound by 8- and 64-fold, respectively. The examination of gene expression in treated C. albicans cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that the active compound tested alone or in combination with 5-flucytosine blocks the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway by downregulating the expression of ERG1, ERG3, ERG5, ERG11, and ERG25 genes.", "The new glycolipid-like compound, produced by Streptomyces S108 isolate, could be a promising drug for medical use against pathogenic Candida isolates."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
