Furthermore, there has been no novel drug discovery for the past five decades, and the emergence of latent, multiple drug-resistant, and extensively drug-resistant species has given rise to an alarming necessity for a novel compound/s for treating this highly untamable microbe. In developing countries, plant-based drugs have shown promising results in combating TB or its symptoms; naturally occurring secondary metabolites can act as lead-drug molecules or can be co-administered with conventional drugs. Therefore, the present study was focused to identify and characterize potential antimycobacterial compounds found in the screened ethnobotanical plants, Tithonia diversifolia (TD) and Couroupita guianensis (CG). These plants are used for treating respiratory disorders and allergies in the traditional medicinal systems.", "These plant leaf extracts were detected and purified using chromatographic techniques for potent antitubercular phytochemicals, and the purified eluents were tested on Mycobacterium smegmatis (MSM) as a surrogate for MTB; further, the fractions inhibiting growth of MSM were characterized through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A toxicity test of the purified samples was also assessed by an in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction and hemolytic assays.", "The analyzed plant extracts showed the presence of a C-15 sesquiterpene, zingiberene in TD, and a phthalate ester, bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, in CG leaf extracts. The toxicity assessment proved the purified fractions to be moderately toxic at higher concentrations (\u2265100 \u03bcg/mL).", "Therefore, the identified compounds can be promising antitubercular agents; however, further in vivo investigations will add substantial value to the compounds being pharmacologically useful."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Sciences, Jain (Deemed-to-be-University), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Priyadarshini", "ForeName": "Nivedita", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Sciences, Jain (Deemed-to-be-University), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Veeramani", "ForeName": "Aranganathan", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Int J Mycobacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "101615660", "ISSNLinking": "2212-5531"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lecythidaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium smegmatis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tithonia"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32474543", "10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_24_20", "IntJMycobacteriol_2020_9_2_195_285222"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
