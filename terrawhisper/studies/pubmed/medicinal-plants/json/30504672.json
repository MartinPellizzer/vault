Sampling of the flowers and herbs of the lavender was performed at different developmental stages, i.e., summer, autumn, and winter (herbs only) using solid phase micro extraction fibers. Linalool, linalyl acetate, \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b1-ocimene, \u03b2-ocimene, and terpinen-4-ol were the predominant constituents originating from the flowers of both plants. Additional volatile compounds such as borneol, eucalyptol, and camphor were found in the Lavandula x intermedia flowers. The number of volatile compounds originating from the Lavandula angustifolia flowers in summer was greater than that in autumn. 3-Hexen-1-ol, 3-carene, and p-cymen-8-ol were volatile compounds characteristic of the herbs, and \u03b1-ocimene, allo-ocimene, and terpinen-4-ol were detected only from flowers. In comparing volatile compounds obtained from fresh herbs with those from dried herbs, camphor, \u03b2-caryophyllene, and borneol were absent in dried herbs. For people who visit the plant garden, smelling the fragrances of plants directly is believed to deliver not only pleasure but also beneficial therapeutic properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University."}], "LastName": "Kasai", "ForeName": "Hiroko", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University."}], "LastName": "Kubota", "ForeName": "Yui", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lavandula"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tokyo"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30504672", "10.1248/yakushi.18-00159"]}}]}
