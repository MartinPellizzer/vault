(<i>C. sativa</i>), has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective capacity. Research continues to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effects of components of <i>C. sativa</i>, with evidence that plant-derived cannabinoids and terpenes can mediate anti-inflammatory activity by targeting toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling, the sensors of pathogen-associated molecules. This study set out to determine if TLR-mediated inflammatory signalling is a CFL-A target using the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce TLR4 signalling in human THP-1-derived macrophages. TLR4 activation promoted the production of the chemokine CXCL10 and cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. Treatment with CFL-A dose-dependently attenuated TLR4-induced CXCL10 and IL-1\u03b2 secretion, with our findings also indicating that the inhibitory effects of CFL-A on chemokine/cytokine secretion are in line with an NF-\u03baB inhibitor. This study highlights TLR4 signalling as a cannflavin target in macrophages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discipline of Physiology, School of Medicine, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Fitzpatrick", "ForeName": "John-Mark K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CB1 Botanicals Ltd, Cork, Ireland."}], "LastName": "O'Riordan", "ForeName": "Diarmuid", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discipline of Physiology, School of Medicine, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Downer", "ForeName": "Eric J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38780010", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2358382"]}}]}
