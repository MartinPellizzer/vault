A number of medicinal plants and their specific parts (flowers, bark, seeds, fruits, seeds and leaves) have been found to be capable of synthesizing CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs. The specific key phytochemical constituents of plants such as alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolic acids, flavones and tannins can play significant role as a reducing, stabilizing and capping agents in the synthesis of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs from their respective precursor solution of metal ions. The CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs are frequently using in diverse fields of science and technology including photocatalytic degradation of dyes, antibiotics as well as antimicrobial applications. In this review, the mechanism behind the green synthesis CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs using plant entities are summarized along with discussion of analytical results from characterization techniques. An overview of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs for water remediation application via photocatalytic degradation of dyes and antibiotics are discussed. In addition, the mechanisms of antimicrobial efficacy of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs and current challenges for their sustainable application at large scale in real environmental conditions are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
