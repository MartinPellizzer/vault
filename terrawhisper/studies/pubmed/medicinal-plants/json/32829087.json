Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes are responsible for causing Lyme arthritis through activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Isoforskolin (ISOF) and Cucurbitacin IIa (CuIIa), compounds derived from Chinese herbs, can exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating single immunoglobulin interleukin-1 receptor-related receptor (SIGIRR; also known as Toll/interleukin-1 receptor 8, TIR8) and thereby inhibiting B. burgdorferi basic membrane protein A (BmpA)-induced TLR signaling in human macrophages, specifically the THP-1 human monocytic cell line. After THP-1 cells were exposed in vitro to: i) recombinant (r)BmpA, ii) rBmpA and ISOF or iii) rBmpA and CuIIa, Cytotoxicity assay (Cell Counting Kit-8, CCK-8) are used to measure the effects of ISOF and CuIIa on cell viability. Meanwhile, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to quantify SIGIRR mRNA and protein levels, respectively, at 6, 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h time points post-stimulation. In addition, proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was determined by ELISA analysis. Our study showed that rBmpA stimulation of THP-1 cells resulted in a drop in SIGIRR levels in THP-1 cells. More importantly, SIGIRR levels increased significantly in rBmpA-stimulated THP-1 cells following ISOF or CuIIa administration, and the results of ELISA analysis suggested that ISOF or CuIIa reduced the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. In conclusion, These results reveal new possibilities for the treatment of Lyme arthritis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
