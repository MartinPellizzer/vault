A thorough integration of information from omics is expected to provide solid evidence-based scientific rationales for the development of modern phytomedicines. This study focused on prediction of Jamu efficacy based on its component metabolites and also identification of important metabolites related to each efficacy group. Initially, we compared the performance of Support Vector Machines and Random Forest to predict the Jamu efficacy with three different data pre-processing approaches, such as no filtering, Single Filtering algorithm, and a combination of Single Filtering algorithm and feature selection using Regularized Random Forest. Both classifiers performed very well and according to 5-fold cross-validation results, the mean accuracy of Support Vector Machine with linear kernel was slightly better than Random Forest. It can be concluded that machine learning methods can successfully relate Jamu efficacy with metabolites. In addition, we extended our analysis by identifying important metabolites from the Random Forest model. The inTrees framework was used to extract the rules and to select important metabolites for each efficacy group. Overall, we identified 94\u2005significant metabolites associated to 12\u2005efficacy groups and many of them were validated by published literature and KNApSAcK Metabolite Activity database."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
