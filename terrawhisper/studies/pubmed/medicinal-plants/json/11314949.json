The purified enzyme, which occurred as a homotetramer with a native Mr of 160 kDa (gel-filtration chromatography) and a subunit Mr of 45 kDa (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), had an optimum pH of 7.0 and a pI of 4.2. Whereas (R)-coclaurine was the best substrate for enzyme activity, Coptis CNMT had broad substrate specificity and no stereospecificity CNMT methylated norlaudanosoline, 6,7-dimethoxyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline. The enzyme did not require any metal ion. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetamide did not inhibit CNMT activity, but the addition of Co2+, Cu2+ or Mn2+ at 5 mM severely inhibited such activity by 75, 47 and 57%, respectively. The substrate-saturation kinetics of CNMT for norreticuline and SAM were of the typical Michaelis-Menten-type with respective Km values of 0.38 and 0.65 mM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Life Sciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morishige", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CW1576313Y", "NameOfSubstance": "coclaurine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "S-adenosyl-L-methionine coclaurine N-methyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11314949", "10.1016/s0031-9422(00)00481-7", "S0031942200004817"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
