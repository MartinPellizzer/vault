Sixty-three bands with sizes ranged from 100 to 2500 bp were generated from 12 primers. Of all the 63 bands, 55 bands were polymorphic among 86 individuals of A. macrocephala, the percentage of polymorphic bands were 87.30% at the species level. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPL) for a single population ranged from 58.73% to 71.43% (mean, 64.85%). Among the 7 populations, a population from Panan, GM exhibited highest variability (PPL =71.43%; HE = 0.2835; I = 0.4267). A dendrogram constructed by an unweighted pair group method of cluster analysis showed that populations from Panan constructed one branch and separated from other populations. In the AMOVA analysis, low level of genetic differentiation among populations was detected, 90.52% of the variability existed in population.", "The genetic diversity of cultivated A. macrocephala in China is high, which is good for the production of high quality herb medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Systematic Evolution and Biodiversity, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yi-hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Bin-long", "Initials": "BL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiao-long", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Pan", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Ying-xiong", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Cheng-xin", "Initials": "CX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Atractylodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19260304"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
