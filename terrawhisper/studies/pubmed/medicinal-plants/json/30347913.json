In the collection of Notopterygium franchetii fruits, we collected a sample of N. forrestii , which is a spurious breed. Fruits of N. franchetii and N. forrestii are very similar in morphology and can be easily confused. Until now the morphological identification of the fruits of Notopterygium has not been reported. To provide a scientific basis for the identification of N. franchetii and N. forrestii fruits, the morphology and microscopic identification were studied in this paper. In this study, stereomicroscope and paraffin sections were used to compare the morphological characteristics and microscopic characteristics of these two fruits. Our results showed that these two fruits were different in size, surface texture and the number of vertical edges on the back. These traits can be used as diagnostic characteristic of these two fruits. The difference between the number of tubing and the endosperm cell contents can be used as microscopic identification features. The above discriminative characteristics can distinguish the two fruits and provide scientific basis for the identification and germplasm evaluation of Notopterygium fruits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiu-Teng", "Initials": "XT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ke-Chun", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Ai-Juan", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lin", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30347913", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180528.001"]}}]}
