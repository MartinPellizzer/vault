There is a wide variety of herbs that are used for culinary purposes worldwide, which are also recognized for their beneficial health effects, and thus have also been used in folk medicine. Besides their nutritional value herbs are rich in many phytochemical components with bioactive effects, thus improving human health. The aim of the present work was to make a general overview of some of these herbs, including their gastronomic usage, their chemical composition in bioactive components and their reported health effects. This work showed that the health effects are very diverse and differ according to the herb in question. However, some of the most frequently citted biological activities include antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CI&DETS Research Centre and Department of Food Industry, ESAV, Quinta da Alagoa, Estrada de Nelas, Ranhados, 3500-606 Viseu, Portugal. raquelguine@esav.ipv.pt."}], "LastName": "Guin\u00e9", "ForeName": "Raquel P F", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "Fernando J", "Initials": "FJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26864553", "10.2174/1389557516666160211120540", "MRMC-EPUB-73612"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
