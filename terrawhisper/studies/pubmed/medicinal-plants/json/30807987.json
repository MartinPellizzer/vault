Recent studies suggested that Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE) has cognitive protective effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).", "To assess the protective effects of RCE on cognitive deficits and clarify its therapeutic mechanisms in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> -induced rat models of AD.", "RCE was prepared by freeze-drying technology. Their protective effects on A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced rat models of AD and the preliminary therapeutic mechanisms were studied.", "The Y maze test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were conducted to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the rats. Subsequently, biochemical assays, hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed to elucidate the mechanisms.", "RCE significantly increased the spontaneous alternation (F (6, 111)\u202f=\u202f8.165, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), prolonged the swimming time (F (6, 111)\u202f=\u202f20.143, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and decreased the escape latency in rat models of AD. In addition, RCE significantly increased the acetylcholine (Ach) level and the choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity (F (6, 34)\u202f=\u202f6.033, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; F (6, 34)\u202f=\u202f6.958, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, respectively), repaired the damage of hippocampus neurons and prevented A\u03b2 formation in the hippocampus in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> injected rats. Moreover, RCE increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in cortex of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> injected rats (F (6, 34)\u202f=\u202f5.097, p\u202f<\u202f0.01; F (6, 34)\u202f=\u202f2.907, p\u202f<\u202f0.05, respectively), significantly reduced the expressions of p-tau (ser396) and induced the expressions of p-GSK3\u03b2 (ser9) in hippocampus (F (6, 34)\u202f=\u202f15.297, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; F (6, 34)\u202f=\u202f9.652, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, respectively).", "Our findings demonstrated that RCE significantly alleviated the learning and memory deficits in the A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced rat models of AD. The mechanisms involved its protection effects against cholinergic system deficiency, oxidative stress damage and GSK3\u03b2 activation.
