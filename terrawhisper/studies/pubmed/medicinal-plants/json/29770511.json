This study examines the incidence of herb-induced liver injury (HILI) and the relationship between risk factors and liver enzyme abnormality (LEA) in inpatients with RD. HILI was analyzed using the Roussel Uclaf causality assessment method liver injury criteria and causality assessment. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the relationship between patient characteristics and LEA in RD. The features of LEA were also examined in each RD. Among 352 patients included in this study, 105 patients showed LEA on admission, of which 6 had fulfilled the Roussel Uclaf causality assessment method criteria. The incidence risks of LEA and HILI were 12.55% and 0.58%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that LEA on admission and occasional use of alcohol could be risk factors for LEA on follow-up. In an additional analysis with each RD, all rheumatoid arthritis patients with LEA were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and 4 out of 5 gout patients with LEA were taking steroids. The use of herbal medicine in RD is relatively safe. However, regular monitoring of liver enzyme tests and examination of alcohol consumption are required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9426-823X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Medicine, Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, 23 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 26 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyeonhoon", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Medicine, Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, 23 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seunghoon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Medicine, Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, 23 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 26 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Jung Won", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Medicine, Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital, 23 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 26 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jae-Dong", "Initials": "JD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HI15C0070", "Agency": "Ministry of Health & Welfare through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inpatients"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Rheumatic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29770511", "10.1002/ptr.6111"]}}]}
