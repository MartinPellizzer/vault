Although they are the most widely-used antibiotics due to their high efficacy and low cost, several main adverse effects have been reported including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Since drug-induced ototoxicity is one of the major etiological causes of acquired hearing loss, we examined cochlear hair cell damages caused by three aminoglycosides (amikacin, kanamycin, and gentamicin), and investigated protective property of an isoquinoline-type alkaloid, Berberine chloride (BC). Berberine, a well-known bioactive compound found from medicinal plants, has been known to have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial effects. To determine protective effect of BC in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, hair cell damages in aminoglycoside- and/or BC-treated hair cells using ex vivo organotypic culture system of mouse cochlea. Mitochondrial ROS levels and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed, and TUNEL assay and immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 were performed to detect apoptosis signals. As the results, it was found that BC significantly prevented aminoglycoside-induced hair cell loss and stereocilia degeneration by inhibiting excessive accumulation of mitochondrial ROS and subsequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. It eventually inhibited DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, which were significant for all three aminoglycosides. This study is the first report suggested the preventative effect of BC against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. Our data also suggests a possibility that BC has the potential to exert a protective effect against ototoxicity caused by various ototoxic drugs leading to cellular oxidative stress, not limited to aminoglycoside antibiotics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
