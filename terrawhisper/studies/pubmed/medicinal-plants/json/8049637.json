To evaluate the chemopreventive properties of garlic in humans, the effects of chronic administration of an aged garlic extract on the disposition of acetaminophen and metabolites were studied. This commonly used drug was chosen because it forms a reactive electrophilic metabolite after oxidative metabolism. Sixteen subjects ingested daily doses of garlic extract (approximately equivalent to six to seven cloves of garlic) for 3 months. Before the course of garlic, at the end of each month and 1 month after termination of garlic administration, a 1-g oral dose of acetaminophen was given to each subject. Plasma and urine were measured for acetaminophen and the glucuronide, sulfate, cysteinyl, mercapturate, and methylthio metabolites. It was found that garlic treatment had no discernible effect on oxidative metabolism but was associated with a slight increase in sulfate conjugation of drug. These findings suggest that garlic extract has limited potential as a chemopreventive agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Eppley Institute, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68131."}], "LastName": "Gwilt", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lear", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tempero", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birt", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grandjean", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruddon", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagel", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "N01-CN-05289-01", "Acronym": "CN", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P30 CA 36727", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "9200608", "ISSNLinking": "1055-9965"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "362O9ITL9D", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaminophen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8BE7G9R76X", "NameOfSubstance": "acetaminophen glucuronide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S6002H6J9F", "NameOfSubstance": "acetaminophen sulfate ester"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaminophen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inactivation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Clearance Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8049637"]}}]}
