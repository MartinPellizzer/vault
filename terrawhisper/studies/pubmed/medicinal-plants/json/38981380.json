Herein, we constructed a Materials Institute Lavoisier 88B (MIL-88B)-on-University of Oslo 66 (UiO-66) composite (MIL-on-UiO) with a unique nanoflower morphology, in which highly stable UiO-66 is the precursor, with MIL-88B grown on its surface. MIL-on-UiO was used as a fiber coating for headspace solid-phase microextraction to enrich PCBs. Experimental results demonstrated that MIL-on-UiO provided better enrichment performance for PCBs than single components due to multiple interactions, including \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, halogen bonding, pore-filling, and steric hindrance effects. The method established using the MIL-on-UiO-based SPME fiber coating provided a good linear relationship in the range of 0.001-50\u00a0ng\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>, with limits of detection ranging from 0.0002 to 0.002\u00a0ng\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup> and enrichment factors between 3530 and 7420. In addition, the method was used to detect trace PCBs in water and orange juice achieving satisfactory recoveries (81%-111%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
