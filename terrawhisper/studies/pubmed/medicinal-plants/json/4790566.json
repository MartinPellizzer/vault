The crude material was separated into several fractions by thin-layer chromatography with the use of silica gel and ethyl acetate-chloroform (2:1). The fractions showing ultraviolet absorption maxima in the vicinity of 340, 358, and 375 to 377 nm were biologically active. The data indicate that the active material, here called \"Passicol\" for the first time, has characteristics of the polyacetylenic group of compounds. The activity can be preserved for a long time when crude material is stored in organic solvent in the dark at 6 C. Gentle bathing of the cut rinds of Passiflora in water in the presence of air and ethylene stimulated the formation of the active principle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birner", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nicolls", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Antimicrob Agents Chemother", "NlmUniqueID": "0315061", "ISSNLinking": "0066-4804"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkynes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37370-32-4", "NameOfSubstance": "passicol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkynes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1973 Jan;3(1):110-7", "ArticleIdList": ["4790567"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1965 Mar;240:1042-4", "ArticleIdList": ["14284699"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1964 Jan;39(1):128-32", "ArticleIdList": ["16655870"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1973", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1973", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4790566", "PMC444368", "10.1128/AAC.3.1.105"]}}]}
