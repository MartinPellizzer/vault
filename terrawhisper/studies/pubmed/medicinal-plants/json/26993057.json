In this study, the effects of AS extract (ASE) on the inhibition of melanin synthesis were investigated in vitro and in vivo.", "To perform this study, the contents of melanin and tyrosinase activity were analysed in B16F10 melanoma cells. Western blotting was carried out to determine the underlyling mechanism. Additionally, we investigated the effect of this extract on hyperpigmentation in C57bL/6J mice induced by 3, 6 and 9 weeks of UVB irradiation.", "AS extract led to reduced melanin synthesis through the regulation of MITF and its downstream signals. Furthermore, ASE increased the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signalling pathway components. In vivo study, hypopigmentation effects were also observed. The melanocyte activity and the distribution of melanin granules were decreased in UVB-irradiated mice treated with ASE.", "These results suggest that the ASE may be promising as an active anti-melanogenic component, and further investigations should be performed regarding its potential as a whitening agent in the field of cosmetics."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Royal
