Lavender oil is frequently selected for aromatherapy as having antiseptic and healing properties. More specifically, it has been used as a bath additive postnatally to reduce perineal discomfort. A blind randomized clinical trial is described, involving three groups of mothers, one using pure lavender oil, one a synthetic lavender oil and one an inert substance as a bath additive for 10 days following normal childbirth. Analysis of daily discomfort scores revealed no statistically significant difference between groups. It cannot be concluded that current practice results in a reduction of postnatal perineal discomfort at the dilution levels used. However, there is some consistency in results between the 3rd and 5th days, with those women using lavender oil as a bath additive recording lower mean discomfort scores. This is a time when the mother usually finds herself discharged home and perineal discomfort is high. A total of 635 women participated and no side-effects were found."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England."}], "LastName": "Dale", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cornwell", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Nurs", "NlmUniqueID": "7609811", "ISSNLinking": "0309-2402"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ZBP1YXW0H8", "NameOfSubstance": "lavender oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Baths"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lavandula"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perineum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Puerperal Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8138636", "10.1111/j.1365-2648.1994.tb01056.x"]}}]}
