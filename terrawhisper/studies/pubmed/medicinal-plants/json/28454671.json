Their structures were unambiguously established by interpretation of spectroscopic data (MS and NMR) and chemical methods. Compound 1 had a rare aglycone featuring a skeleton of 16-oxaandrost-5-en-3-ol-17-one, which was reported for the first time. The isolated saponins were tested for cytotoxicities against HCT116 cells, and trillikamtoside R (8) was found to show the most cytotoxic effect with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.92\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
