Rotavirus propagated on MA 104 cells with different concentrations of the extract was used in the assays. Incidence on cellular and viral RNA synthesis was evaluated by measuring the radioactivity incorporated using labelled precursors. An inhibition of 42% and 79% of the cellular RNA synthesis was observed when respectively 25 microliters/ml and 50 microliters/ml concentrations of the alkalo\u00efd extract were tested. After 20 h incubation a decrease of the viral RNA synthesis was observed. It was of 46%, 36% and 27% compared to the control when respectively 25 microliters/ml, 50 microliters/ml and 100 microliters/ml concentrations of the extract were tested. Besides, the maximum viral production was delayed parallelly to the increase of the extract concentration. A similar viral synthesis inhibition was obtained after only 4 hours incubation suggesting that the extract interfere in the early events of the viral cycle."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie, Laboratoire d'Hydrologie, Paris."}], "LastName": "Husson", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vilagines", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sarrette", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vilagines", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Etude de l'action antivirale des alcalo\u00efdes totaux d'Haemanthus albiflos."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Ann Pharm Fr", "NlmUniqueID": "2985176R", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rotavirus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7864531"]}}]}
