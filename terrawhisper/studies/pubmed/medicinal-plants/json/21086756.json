Antimicrobial activities of a number of phytochemicals have been reported. Many present day antibiotics are ineffective against several pathogenic organisms. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from clinical specimens is reported to have resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics. In the present study, the effect of hexane, diethyl ether, acetone and water extracts of leaves of a medicinal plant Holoptelea integrifolia has been tested against beta-lactam resistant strain of S. aureus in presence of antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The diethyl ether extract has shown the maximum antibacterial activity and the active principle is found to be 1,4-naphthalenedione which is characterized by GC-MS and FTIR spectroscopy. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compound is found to be 4 mg/ml. Structural similarity of this compound with a functional group of a beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotic indicates that 1,4-naphthlenedione may be acting as an inhibitor to beta-lactamase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology, Kannur University, Thalassery Campus, Palayad P O, Kerala 670 661, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vinod", "ForeName": "N V", "Initials": "NV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haridas", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sadasivan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0310774", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ulmaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21086756"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
