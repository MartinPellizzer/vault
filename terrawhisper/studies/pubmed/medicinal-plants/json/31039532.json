Although the plant metabolomics provide a powerful tool for species classification, the discovered marker is usually limited in practical application. For rapid discovery of efficient marker combination, we proposed a strategy integrating targeted metabolite profiling and sequential optimization method.", "This strategy included: (1) directional enrichment and chemical profiling of targeted metabolites by matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). (2) Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA)-based sequential screening of efficient marker combination was constructed for various species predictions. Five Lonicera species and their characteristic metabolites, sponins, were taken as a case study.", "A total of 19 saponins were identified, and 12 major and available saponins were enriched based on MSPD and quantified by LC-MS/MS in 5 Lonicera species flower buds. Followed by 3 runs of PLS-DA-based screening, a combination consisting of macranthoidin B, dipsacoside B and \u03b1-hederin was discovered as the effective chemical marker for 5 analogous Lonicera flower classification.", "Our study provides an effective and applicable approach to select the practical marker combination for the assessment of analogical herb medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
