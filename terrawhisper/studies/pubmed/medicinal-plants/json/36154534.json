Nowadays, mushroom is also a \"super food\" recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and favored by consumers. Discrimination of mushroom including species, geographic origin, storage time, etc., is an important prerequisite to ensure their edible safety and commodity quality. Moreover, the effective evaluation of its chemical composition can help us better understand the nutritional properties of mushrooms. Modern analytical technologies such as chromatography, spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, etc., are widely used in the discrimination and evaluation researches of mushrooms, and chemometrics is an effective means of scientifically processing the multidimensional information hidden in these analytical technologies. This review will outline the latest applications of modern analytical technology combined with chemometrics in qualitative and quantitative analysis and quality control of mushrooms in recent years. Briefly describe the basic principles of these technologies, and the analytical processes of common chemometrics in mushroom researches will be summarized. Finally, the limitations and application prospects of chromatography, spectroscopy and mass spectrometry technology are discussed in mushroom quality control and evaluation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhaotong University, Zhaotong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Honggao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jieqing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "51"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36154534", "10.1080/10408347.2022.2124839"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
