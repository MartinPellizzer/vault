The children were classified by socioeconomic status, depending upon their living conditions and family income. A composite diet representing the typical diet according to socioeconomic group was formulated and chemically evaluated. Corn tortillas and beans were the primary protein and energy sources for the children of this study. The inclusion of dairy products, animal products, and fruits and vegetables was not common. The children in the low-income group, which represents the majority of the children of this area, received only 63% of the recommended intake. Also for the low-income group, protein and iron recommendations were met but by plant-based sources. Protein contributed 10% of the energy, 78% were from carbohydrates and 12% from fat. Calcium intake was low, meeting only 34% of the recommendation and zinc intake was 51%. Fiber intake was very high, coming primarily from beans and tortillas. In the low- income group, Z scores for height and age were -1.60 for boys and -1.75 for girls. Weight-for-age Z scores were -0.90 and -0.97 for boys and girls, respectively. The weight-for-height Z scores for this group were 0.33 and 0.12 for boys and girls, respectively. Although energy needs were not met, extreme stunting was not detected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 S.
