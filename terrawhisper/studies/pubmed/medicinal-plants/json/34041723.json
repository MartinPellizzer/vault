In August 2020, the Herbal Medicinal Products Committee, in its new draft public statement, proposed a daily intake of 1.0\u2009\u00b5g of pyrrolizidine alkaloids per day for adults in general, also including contaminations of herbal medicinal products. Over the past years, the results of data collections showed a remarkable reduction of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid burden in herbal drugs and herbal extracts. Meanwhile, a stable situation has been achieved for herbal drugs, while further improvement can be observed for herbal extracts. The results indicate that the implemented measures have been efficient and contribute to a continuous and sustainable reduction of pyrrolizidine alkaloid contamination. A permanent limit of 1.0\u2009\u00b5g of pyrrolizidine alkaloids per day is considered appropriate to guarantee sufficient availability of batches used for the production of herbal medicinal products. The new Ph.Eur. general chapter 2.8.26 describes, as an example, an analytical procedure suitable for the determination of target pyrrolizidine alkaloids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
