Its fruit is a precious nut in China, rich in vitamins and minerals, can be directly eaten, can also be used as medicinal plants with functions of lowering blood lipids and softening blood vessels (Wang 2022). From 2018 to 2020, typical root rot symptoms of Torreya grandis was found in plantations in Huangshan and surrounding areas of Huangshan, Anhui province, China. About 15 to 32% of root rot disease incidence was recorded at the plantation. Diseased plants were observed with symptoms such as yellow to brownish leaves without lesions and later drying, and rotten roots looked dark brown while the roots of heathy plants showed white, and eventually leading to the death of the diseased plant. The root rot symptomatic plants were collected in June of 2020. Tissues were cut to the length of 0.3 to 0.5 cm, then surface sterilized by 2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and 75% alcohol for 1 min, rinsed three times in sterile distilled water, and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25\u2103 for 5 to 9 days. Eight isolates with similar morphology were isolated from single spores. On PDA, the isolates produced abundant aerial white mycelia with septation and turned violet to dark pink on the reverse side of the culture. Morphological characteristic was determined using a pure culture grown on synthetic low nutrient agar (SNA). Two types of conidia, microconidia and macroconidia, were observed on SNA. Macroconidia were long and slender, usually 3 to 5 septate, measuring 2.7 to 4.3 \u00d7 22.3 to 49.6 \u03bcm (n=30), and narrowed at the both ends. Microconidia were abundant, oval, clavate or ovate, zero to one septate and measured 1.6 to 3.9 \u00d7 4.4 to 13.0 \u03bcm (n=50). According to the culture and conidial characteristics, the isolates were tentatively identified as Fusarium species (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Four isolates were random selected for molecular identification. The general primers ITS1/ITS4 for internal transcribed spacer (ITS) (White et al. 1990), EF1/EF2 for translation elongation factor (TEF1) (O'Donnell et al. 1998), 5F2/7cR for the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase \u2161(RPB2) (O'Donnell et al., 2007), H3-1a/H3-1b for Histone H3 (Jacobs et al., 2010), F5/R8 for subunits 1 of DNA-directed RNA polymerase \u2161 (RPB1) (O'Donnell et al. 2010) and MS3F/MS3R for mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) (Stenglein et al. 2010) were amplified, respectively. The products were sequenced and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers of MW350689, MW029444, ON077156, ON077158, ON077157, ON054432, respectively. Blast analysis showed 99.40 to 100% sequence homology with known F. fujikuroi isolates. A phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences clustered from the combined datasets (TEF1, RPB2, Histone H3, RPB1 and mtSSU) revealed the isolate most closely related to the F. fujikuroi (100% bootstrap). Fifteen 2-year-old healthy plants of Torreya grandis were selected for the pathogenicity test. A conidial suspension (1\u00d7106 conidia/ml) was prepared by collecting spores from 10-day-old cultures on PDA. The root of each plants inoculated with 200 ml of a 106 conidia/ml suspension, and the five control plants inoculated with sterilized water. The plants were incubated in green house with 25\u2103 (14 h light)/22\u2103 (10 h dark) at 85% humidity. Two weeks later, 100% of artificially inoculated plants showed the same symptoms similar to those observed in the plantation, like yellow leaves, dark brown and rotten roots, meanwhile, the roots of control plants displayed healthy. From symptomatic roots, the pathogen was reisolated which satisfying Koch's postulates. F. fujikuroi causes root rot of soybean and Reineckia carnea (Detranaltes et al. 2021, Sun et al. 2018).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of F. fujikuroi causing root rot of Torreya grandis in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huangshan, China; xiaoshitou4632@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huangshan, China; 2586988769@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "He", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HuangShan, China; lyt03170701@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HuangShan, China; hsxycL@hsu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huangshan, China; 375223472@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Fengbo", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huangshan, China; wanzb626@hsu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Zhi-Bin", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huangshan, China; zhangye411@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36372765", "10.1094/PDIS-03-22-0710-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
