The pain models were prepared by injection of acetic acid and uterospasm model in the female mouse was induced by diethylstilbestrol and pitocin. A hyperlipidemia model was also made in the rats.", "Danqi capsule could significantly improve ECG in myocardial ischemia of rats induced by isoproterenol and prolong the mice survival time under hypoxic situation. In the experiment to observe the pain response with body twist as a index induced by acetic acid and uterospasm induced by diethylstilbestrol and pitocin, Danqi capsule could significantly shorten the latency and the time course of body twist. The contents of triglyceride(TG) and total cholesterol(TC) were decreased, while the level of high-density liporotein-cholesterol(HDL-c) was increased after treatment of Danqi capsule in in the rats with hyperlipidemia. Hemorheological data showed that the blood viscosity, blood reductive viscosity, erythrocyte rigidity index and electrophoresis time were significantly decreased by Danqi capsule in the animal model mentioned above as compared with control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In addition, the dose of Danqi capsule is less than that of Danqi tablet for producing equivalent effect.", "Danqi capsule plays a good role in improving myocardial ischemia, increasing the tolerant ability against oxygen-deficiency, alleviating pain and descending the levels of blood fat and blood viscosity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept of Pharmacy, Fujian College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, China. wufuhuo@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fu-huo", "Initials": "FH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xue-mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Ru", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Viscosity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16499031"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
