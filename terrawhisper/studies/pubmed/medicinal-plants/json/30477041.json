This review provides information on medicinal plants embraced in South Africa for hypertension management, with the aim of reporting pharmacological information on the indigenous use of these plants as antihypertensives. This review not only focuses on the activity of antihypertensive medicinal plants but also reports some of its phytochemical constituents and other ethnopharmacological and therapeutic properties. Information obtained from scientific and or unpublished databases such as Science Direct, PubMed, SciFinder, JSTOR, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and various books revealed 117 documented antihypertensive plant species from 50 families. Interestingly, Asteraceae topped the list with 16 species, followed by Fabaceae with 8\u00a0species; however, only 25% of all plant species have demonstrated antihypertensive effects originating from both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, lending credence to their folkloric use. Only 11 plant species reportedly possess antihypertensive properties in animal models, with very few species subjected to analytical processes to reveal the identity of their bioactive antihypertensive compounds. In this review, we hope to encourage researchers and global research institutions (universities, agricultural research councils, and medical research councils), particularly those showing an interest in natural products, for the need for concerted efforts to undertake more studies aimed at revealing the untapped potential of these plants. These studies are very important for the development of new pharmaceuticals of natural origin useful for the management of hypertension."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and phytopharmacology Research Group, Department of Plant Sciences, University of the Free State, QwaQwa Campus, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Balogun", "ForeName": "Fatai Oladunni", "Initials": "FO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and phytopharmacology Research Group, Department of Plant Sciences, University of the Free State, QwaQwa Campus, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Ashafa", "ForeName": "Anofi Omotayo Tom", "Initials": "AOT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30477041", "10.1055/a-0801-8771"]}}]}
