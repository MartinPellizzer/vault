Substances that prevent mast cells from releasing histamine are considered antiallergic agents. The drugs utilized to treat allergy are mast cell stabilizers, steroids, anti-histamine, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and decongestants. Anti-histamine drugs have side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, constipation, difficulty urinating, blurred vision, etc. The use of medicinal plants for the effective and safe management of diseases has recently received much attention. Various herbs are utilized for their antiallergic and anti-histaminic properties. Some of the herbs useful in the management of allergic diseases of the respiratory tract, like Piper longum, Ocimum tenuiflorum, Solanum xanthocarpum have been discussed. Ample scientific evidence is available for the anti-histaminic and antiallergic activity of Azadirachta indica, Aloe vera, Tinospora cordifolia, and many other such herbs are safer to use as antiallergic agents have been reported. The review summarizes a wide variety of herbs and botanical ingredients with their common scientific names and distribution for easy identification and usage as safe antiallergic agents and discusses their molecular mechanisms involved in combating allergic reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gargi College, University of Delhi, Siri Fort Road, New Delhi-110049, India."}], "LastName": "Saini", "ForeName": "Rashmi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gargi College, University of Delhi, Siri Fort Road, New Delhi-110049, India."}], "LastName": "Dhiman", "ForeName": "Neena K", "Initials": "NK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Antiinflamm Antiallergy Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101462262", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5230"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mast Cell Stabilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukotriene Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nasal Decongestants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820484N8I3", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cell Stabilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Leukotriene Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nasal Decongestants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35410623", "10.2174/1871523021666220411111743", "AIAAMC-EPUB-122454"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
