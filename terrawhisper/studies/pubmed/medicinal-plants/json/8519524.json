Twenty four hours after the last injection the animals were bled and the blood samples were stored at -20 degrees C until assay for liver lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme activity. The livers, kidneys, hearts and gonads were dissected out, immediately fixed in Bouin's fluid, and subsequently processed for histological examination. It was found that the gonads and hearts of the drug-treated mice were histologically similar to those of control animals. After treatment with the lowest dose of the herbs i.e. 1 mg/25 body weight, the liver and kidney did not undergo observable changes. However, the herbs at the doses of 5 mg and 10 mg/25 g body weight produced damaging effects on the liver and kidney, the effects produced by the higher dose being more dramatic. The tissue damage was accompanied by elevations of liver LDH isozyme activity in the serum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Y X", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "M Z", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "W K", "Initials": "WK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gonads"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Fixation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8519524", "10.1177/096032719501400604"]}}]}
