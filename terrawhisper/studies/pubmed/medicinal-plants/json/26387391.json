Bioassay-guided fractionation of extracts was used to isolate flavonoid compounds from the ethanolic extracts.", "The 95% and 50% ethanolic extracts of SG showed remarkably high anti-allergic activity, with IC50 values of 5.74 \u00b1 2.44 and 23.54 \u00b1 4.75 \u00b5g/ml, much higher activity than that for Ketotifen (IC50 58.90 \u00b5M). The water extract had negligible activity (IC50 > 100 \u00b5g/ml). The two isolated flavonols, Engeletin and Astilbin, showed weak anti-allergic activity, IC50 values 97.46 \u00b1 2.04 and >100 \u00b5g/ml, respectively.", "The 95% and 50% ethanolic extracts of SG showed strong anti-allergic activity, but two flavonol constituents did not show any significant anti-allergic activity. These findings suggest that a combination of effects of various phytochemicals in crude extracts used in traditional medicine, are responsible for the purported anti-allergic activity of SG herbal preparations. The plethora of constituents in crude extracts, as yet unidentified, are likely to be acting synergistically to account for the strong observed anti-allergic in vitro activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Itharat", "ForeName": "Arunporn", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srikwan", "ForeName": "Kamonmas", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruangnoo", "ForeName": "Srisopa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thongdeeying", "ForeName": "Pakakrong", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "J Med Assoc Thai", "NlmUniqueID": "7507216", "ISSNLinking": "0125-2208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "engeletin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29838-67-3", "NameOfSubstance": "astilbin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.52", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Smilax"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26387391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
