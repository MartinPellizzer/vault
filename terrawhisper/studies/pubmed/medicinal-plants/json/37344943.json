It is also a commercially important fruit tree in China and worldwide. In the summer of 2022, a serious root rot disease occurred in some pomegranate orchards in Xichuan County(32\u00ba42\u00b4 N, 111\u00ba48\u00b4 E), Henan Province, China, with an incidence of ~30%. Symptoms included leaf yellowing and wilting, root browning and rotting, and stem-base cracking, eventually leading to defoliation and death. To isolate the causal agent, small pieces (5\u00d75 mm) of diseased root from six trees were surface-sterilized by dipping in 2% NaClO for 8 min followed by 70% ethanol for 15 s, rinsed five times with sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), then incubated at 28\u00b0C in the dark for 5 days. Fifteen pure fungal isolates with the same morphological characteristics were obtained from 24 pieces of roots. All isolates produced white fluffy mycelia. Microconidia were hyaline, oval or reniform, with zero to one septa and dimensions of 7.1 to 19.9 (average 14.5 )\u00d7 3.8 to 8.0 (average 5.6) \u03bcm (n = 100). Macroconidia were sickle-shaped, one to four septate, and 20.1 to 40.8 (average 26.5) \u00d7 4.8 to 8.6 (average 6.5) \u03bcm (n = 100). Chlamydospores were spherical, single, in pairs or chains, and 5.6 to 9.8 (average 6.8) \u00b5m in diameter (n = 100). Based on the above characteristics, the pathogens were identified as Fusarium sp. (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia of two representative isolates Fs1 and Fs3. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF-1\u03b1) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) sequences were PCR amplified using primer pairs of ITS1/ITS4, EF1/EF2, and RPB2-5f2/RPB2-7cr, RPB2-7cf/RPB2-11ar (O'Donnell et al., 2022), respectively. BLAST analysis showed that the ITS, TEF-1\u03b1 and RPB2 sequences of isolates Fs1(GenBank accession nos. OK001765, OQ921726 and OQ928396) and Fs3 (GenBank accession nos. OK001771, OQ921727 and OQ928397) showed 99%-100% identity with multiple GenBank sequences of Fusarium falciforme (KY617066, MN064683, KF255514, OQ933361, KY556711 and ON331935). A phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of ITS, TEF-1\u03b1 and RPB2 using maximum-likelihood analysis revealed that both isolates Fs1 and Fs3 were in the same clade with F. falciforme strains. Based on the morphological and molecular characteristics, the isolates were identified as members of F. falciforme. For pathogenicity testing, conidial suspensions (1\u00d7108 spores /mL) of isolates Fs1 and Fs3 were poured onto the roots of healthy pomegranate that had been planted in pots two months previously. Ten plants were inoculated for each isolate. Control plants were drenched with sterile water. After 3 months, inoculated plants developed leaf yellowing and wilting accompanied by root browning and rotting, much like symptoms observed in field plants. The same fungi re-isolated from the experimental plants were confirmed to be F. falciforme by morphology and sequence analysis. This is the first report of F. falciforme causing root rot on pomegranate. F. falciforme is a ubiquitous soil-borne pathogen that causes root rot on multiple plants around the world (Xu F., et al. 2022; Qiu R., et al. 2023). The results of pathogen identification are essential precursors to development of effective control of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Daxue RoadNanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; fug110@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang, China; 985300864@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Siqing", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning Daxue East Road NO.174, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; 78960987@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Chan Juan", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 174 East University Road, Xixiangtang District, Nanning,Guangxi, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530001; 1464596962@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 117866, Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China; shbojiang@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shangbo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanning, China; 42610255@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning, Guangxi, China; plianfu@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Lian Fu", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanyang Normal University, School of Agricultural Engineering, No.1638, Wolong Rd, Nanyang, Henan, China, 473061; silianghuang@aliyun.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Siliang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, No.189, Changgang road, Nanning City,Guangxi, P.R.China, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530023; yeyunfeng111@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yunfeng", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37344943", "10.1094/PDIS-05-23-0899-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
