IPF still remains a great burden to the universe. At the moment, the available therapeutic regimens utilized for IPF such as non-pharmacological therapies (lung transplantation) and pharmacological therapies (drugs, nintedanib, pirfenidone, etc.) are normally accompanied by significant limitations, such as adverse reactions, low bioavailability, poor selectivity, low-tissue distribution, <i>in vivo</i> instability, systemic toxicity, inconveniency and unsafe usage. There is a need for the exploration and discovery of new novel remedies by researchers and scientists globally. Recent numerous preliminary studies have laid significant emphasis and demonstrated the antifibrotic importance, good curative actions (little or no adverse reactions), and multiple target sites of the active components from traditional herbal medicine (THM) against IPF, which could serve as a modern, alternative and potential therapeutics or drug candidates in treating IPF. This paper extensively summarizes the pharmacological actions and signaling pathways or mechanisms of active components obtained from THM for treating IPF. Moreover, the sources and modernization, markets, relevant FDA and CFDA studies (the USA and China), preclinical analysis, and various compositions of THM currently under clinical trials are also highlighted. Additionally, this present analytical data would be instrumental towards further drug progression or advancement of active components from THM for the potential therapeutics of IPF in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.
