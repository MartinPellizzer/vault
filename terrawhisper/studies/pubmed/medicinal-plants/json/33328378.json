Two hundred and eighty water samples were collected randomly from different areas, places, and sources from the state and examined for the presence of E. coli as a fecal contamination indicator. Isolation and identification of E. coli were performed using culture characteristics on different culture media and biochemical reactions. An antimicrobial sensitivity test was performed for all isolated E. coli using agar disk diffusion method. DNA was extracted by boiling method, and bacterial genomic DNA used as a template to detect bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> group 1 by PCR. Results showed 86 (30.7%) E. coli were isolated out of 280 water samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the highest resistant percentage was 59% for tetracycline, followed by 35% for gentamycin, while for chloramphenicol and cefotaxime was 22 and 20%, respectively. bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> group 1 was detected in about 40% of all isolates. This study concludes that drinking water in Khartoum State may be contaminated with feces and might be a possible source for transferring resistant bacteria. Thus, it may be one of the critical causes of increasing reports of antimicrobial resistance in Khartoum State."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21452, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Altayb", "ForeName": "Hisham N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Sudan University for Science and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Salih", "ForeName": "Eman Khalid", "Initials": "EK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, P.O.Box 173, Alkharj 11942, Saudi Arabia and Department of Microbiology, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and Traditional Medicine Research Institute (MAPTMRI), National Center for Research, P.O.
