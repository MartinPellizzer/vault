Liquiritigenin (LQG) is shown to protect mice from cardiotoxicity. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our study aimed to reveal the role of ARHGAP18 in LQG-mediated cardioprotective effects in CHF. In the current study, CHF cell model and rat model were established by the application of doxorubicin (DOX). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and cell apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The cardiac function of rats was evaluated by measuring left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and serum level of lactate dehydrogenase and brain natriuretic peptide. The expression of active RhoA was elevated and that of ARHGAP18 was decreased in DOX-induced CHF cell model. ARHGAP18 could reduce DOX-induced RhoA activation, ROS elevation, and cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, the knockdown of ARHGAP18 could promote the activation of RhoA, the level of ROS, and the rate of cell apoptosis, which could be reversed by the application of RhoA inhibitor. LQG promoted the expression of ARHGAP18 and exerted similar effects of ARHGAP18 in CHF cell model. The application of LQG could also reverse the effects mediated by ARHGAP18 knockdown. Moreover, LQG significantly improved cardiac function and ameliorated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity of CHF rats. In conclusion, LQG could alleviate DOX-induced CHF via promoting ARHGAP18 and suppressing RhoA/ROCK1 pathway. LQG was a potential agent for CHF treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
